[{"instruction": "Good afternoon, Charles.  I hope you don't mind Roberto here.  He's been following me around for about four months now, collecting information about my life and recording its events as he sees them.  He's making a CD-Rom about what it's like to be the CEO of a large company.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Mr. Major.  No, I guess I don't mind if Roberto stays for our session, although due to the nature of..."}, {"instruction": "So I want to start by saying that I have unlimited access to any top celebrities in your field, Charles.  But I have confidence that the man who provides for the emotional needs of my employees can satisfy my exigencies as well.", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "Of course you can, Charles.  SII only hires the best.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I was going to inquire what was the purpose of our session, Mr. Major.  I just got a brief message from your assistant..."}, {"instruction": "It's therapy, Charles.  Why else do you think I'd be here?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I..."}, {"instruction": "It's hard running a company like Silicon Impressions.  We always have to keep up with that cutting edge.", "input": "", "output": "Are we talking about stress..."}, {"instruction": "Stress?  That's part of my job.  I live for stress.  I have more than enough resources to give up the rat race, so to speak.  But where's the fun in that?  Do you plan to retire, Charles?", "input": "", "output": "I haven't thought..."}, {"instruction": "Of course not.  You're so young.  I didn't realize you were so young.  And a very good looking man, too, I might add.  Don't you think, Berto?", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, I..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, don't be modest, Charles.  We're all men here.  Looks are an asset.  Ugly people have a much harder time in life.  But I'm sure you know that--your patients must talk about this all the time.", "input": "", "output": "Mr. Major, perhaps you can tell me why you thought it necessary to seek my help."}, {"instruction": "It's my nose.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "My nose.  I've had problems with it since I was a little boy.  Do you have allergies, Charles?", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes."}, {"instruction": "Lucky man.  I really suffer.  There are times of the year when I have to move out of the Bay Area just to keep my sanity.  My assistant gets daily reports on the pollen count in the area and if it gets above a certain number, she arranges for my jet to be ready that morning and changes my schedule to accommodate.  It's terrible, Charles.  My life is controlled by my sinuses.", "input": "", "output": "Have you thought of allergy shots?"}, {"instruction": "I tried all that stuff at one time or another.  It's all placebo--they hope if they could fool your mind into thinking that it can cope with all the crap in the air, the patient will actually feel better.  Never worked for me.", "input": "", "output": "So how do you think I can help?"}, {"instruction": "I think you might not really understand the extent of my problem, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "No, I'm afraid I don't."}, {"instruction": "As a child, I was addicted to nose drops--I was an antihistamine junkie.  I couldn't go to bed without having that little bottle of nose drops by my bed.  It's not that I was necessarily going to use them that night, but I was afraid of waking up in the middle of the night not being able to breathe.  When my family moved to this country from Hungary, one of my biggest fears was the loss of my nose drop supply.", "input": "", "output": "There are nose drops available in the United States."}, {"instruction": "Of course there are.  But I was young and was not aware of that fact.  Look.  I have to be able to breathe all the time.  I have to be able to breathe through my nose.  Deep breaths like this--ahhhh!  If I can't do that, I can't sleep.  I just lie there, desperately trying to breathe.", "input": "", "output": "Can you please describe what you feel during those times, Mr. Major?"}, {"instruction": "The feelings are very strong.  It's like I'm trapped somewhere.  Like there's not enough oxygen in the room.  I feel anxious and stressed.  I would do anything to clear my nose.  I overdose on nose drops, using them at a rate of ten...twenty times more than recommended.  I try combining different brands of antihistamine pills to achieve my most desired goal--to breathe through my nose again.  I've experienced times when I was ready to rip my nose off my face.  Charles, what I'm talking about is not a mild desire for a clear nose.  I need to be able to breathe.  The heaviness of the sinus pressure drives me insane.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I realize that my reaction to what people call a \"runny nose\" is somewhat extreme.", "input": "", "output": "It is."}, {"instruction": "But it's there.  And I've struggled to live with it for fifty-six years!  The torture.  And the funny thing is that when I'm not congested, I can't even imagine how it would feel not be able to breathe through my nose.  But when it happens...\"my kingdom for a nose!\"", "input": "", "output": "You're describing symptoms of panic associated with the inability to breathe through your nose."}, {"instruction": "Panic.  I think that's a good term to describe what I feel.  I think you're beginning to understand me, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "How often would you say you find yourself in such a desperate state?"}, {"instruction": "I try to avoid it as much as possible of course--leaving town during high pollen count days, getting flu shots each winter, having special air filters in my office and home.  I've been experimenting with interferon drops, but that's all kind of hush hush. I do all that I can to minimize my danger.  But there are still those dreaded nights.", "input": "", "output": "Nights?  Would you say that your distress is greater during the night?"}, {"instruction": "I think it has to do with body positioning.  During the day, the vertical alignment of the body keeps the sinuses from becoming completely clogged.  But at night...I do what I can with pillows.  But it's usually of little help.  Nights are the worst.", "input": "", "output": "If you actually fall asleep, are you able to stay asleep or does your inability to breathe wake you up?"}, {"instruction": "I have a great deal of difficulty falling asleep during those times, even with high amounts of antihistamine in my system.", "input": "", "output": "But once you are able to fall asleep, can you continue and get some rest? Or..."}, {"instruction": "If I'm lucky.  But usually it's about two to three nights of hell for a common cold.  I'm intimately familiar with the progression of a sinus infection.  I know all of its phases.  So I'm very good of predicting just how long my suffering will last.  There's some relief in knowing the exact duration of torture--I can mentally prepare myself for it.  But this only partly alleviates my horror.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  There are a few things you said that raise flags for me."}, {"instruction": "Only a few?", "input": "", "output": "I'm worried that you might be overdosing yourself with antihistamines and thus instead of relieving the problem, you are contributing to it.  The body's reaction to an antihistamine overdose is to produce even more..."}, {"instruction": "Don't you think I know that, Charles?", "input": "", "output": "But why..."}, {"instruction": "I didn't get to be the CEO of a large computer company, not to mention a self-made millionaire, by not doing such simple research as reading a label on the back of a medicine package.  But I need to feel some degree of control over my breathing.  You know, Charles, I no longer use the 12 or 24 hour lasting medications.  Why not, would you ask?  Because I prefer the short-term ones--they give me more control.  I could do something about my problem every 3 to 4 hours instead of waiting a whole day.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Mr. Major, why don't..."}, {"instruction": "Charles, I'm being beeped.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Why don't you take a couple of days to think about my problems, Charles.  And then get back to me.  I'll try to arrange something in my schedule to stop by your office soon.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Mr. Major, as you wish."}, {"instruction": "My assistant will get back to you.  Oh, and let me say that you're really doing fine work here.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Mr. Major."}, {"instruction": "There are so many people at SII that could use your services.", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "I'm aware of who you're seeing, Charles.  And those individuals need your help.  I wish you were around for Helen.", "input": "", "output": "Helen?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Helen Gregory. Oh, you know her?  You must have been with the company longer than I thought.  Helen's been gone for awhile.", "input": "", "output": "I know."}, {"instruction": "She was a fine woman.  A bit on the strange side, but she could drink bourbon and smoke cigars with the best of us.  We often had a few together after work.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Fine woman.  I miss our chats.  Have you heard from her recently, Charles?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, sir.  I really can't discuss my other patients."}, {"instruction": "Of course not.  Just an idle thought.  But I've got to get going now, Charles.  Keep up the good work.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, sir."}, {"instruction": "It was very nice to meet you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Likewise."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, sir.  Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Mr. Major.  Roberto.  I tried getting in touch with you earlier, but I..."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure you did, Charles.  But the CEO's job is never done.  I even had to suffer through two major allergy attacks; I had a board of directors meeting and I couldn't get away.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear..."}, {"instruction": "It's history.  Now, I have a little problem to discuss with you, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Mr. Major, I've done some research into your condition and I think the thing to try first would be some sleeping ..."}, {"instruction": "Yes, sir.", "input": "", "output": "So as I was saying, I think sleeping pills might alleviate..."}, {"instruction": "I would like to talk with you about a friend of mine.", "input": "", "output": "Sure, Mr. Major.  What's seems to be the problem?"}, {"instruction": "He has been diagnosed with testicular cancer.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry."}, {"instruction": "It happened about three months ago, I believe.", "input": "", "output": "Is he..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, he'll be fine.  But he's been left unable to bless this world with anymore of his offsprings.  I tried telling him that having children is not all that he imagines.  I got two, Charles.  I have a bit of experience on this subject.  But you know how it is?  If you can't have something, then you must have it.", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  But how can I help your friend?"}, {"instruction": "Fortunately without his permission or even knowledge, one fine lady was creative enough to conceive and bear his children.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure you do, Charles.  I'm sure you do.  So what are we going to do about that?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean, Mr. Major?"}, {"instruction": "Come on, Charles.  We're not children, there's no reason to play games.", "input": "", "output": "If I understand correctly what you're driving at, Mr. Major, then I have to tell you that I'm not at liberty to discuss any of my patients with anyone.  Even you."}, {"instruction": "Let's talk frankly, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "You talk, I'll listen."}, {"instruction": "There is a very high probably that one or even both of Sylvia's children could have been fathered by Richard Watson.  I've seen his charts and calculations and I believe him.  Sylvia took something that belong to Richard under false pretenses and used it to advance her own agenda.", "input": "", "output": "That's an interesting way of putting it.  I believe that Richard was a willing and even enthusiastic participant in that transaction."}, {"instruction": "All men are willing and enthusiastic when it comes to releasing their sperm, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "I've..."}, {"instruction": "Sylvia took advantage of that male weakness.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Is that all you're going to say?", "input": "", "output": "I really can't discuss..."}, {"instruction": "Then let's talk about Richard, shall we?", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "Good.  When he first wanted to file his custody suit for Sylvia's children, I thought it was ridiculous.  I told him as much.  I think he wanted to damage Sylvia's relationship with her husband, with whom I must assume she was having a few problems already.  I told Richard that it was just going to piss her off, even if it worked.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "As you can see, Charles, human relationships are not completely foreign to me.  I even considered psychotherapy as a field for a while.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "You don't agree?", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "No matter.  The situation drastically changed after Richard was diagnosed with cancer.  And, I have to say, my attitude toward his lawsuit changed as well.  I've known Richard for many years.  He is a fine man, Charles.  On some levels, he's a better man that I.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure."}, {"instruction": "He always wanted children.  But he's young and thought he had many years ahead of him to fulfill his desires.  I've even talked him out of a few myself.  So now that he's stranded, so to speak, in such a bizarre predicament, I find it my duty and obligation to come to his aid.  Do you understand me, Charles?", "input": "", "output": "I think so."}, {"instruction": "Good.  Please believe that I have nothing against Ms. Bows.  In fact, her determination was sort of amusing.  I believed that she might have had more men than I in the same period of time.  And that's difficult, Charles.  Yes, I do know that you're aware of my extra curricular activities.  But I know my secrets are safe with you.", "input": "", "output": "There is nothing I can do to help you or Mr. Watson."}, {"instruction": "I was hoping that you understood me better than that, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "I understand you perfectly, sir."}, {"instruction": "All I'm really asking of you, Charles, is to do what you normally do with Sylvia.  Talk to her.  Perhaps explore some deeply repressed guilt.  Imagine the situation in reverse--a man unknowing extracts her eggs and proceeds with fertilization and giving birth to her children.  All without her knowledge or consent.  When she realizes what's happened, she's also told that she's no longer able to have children.  The children produced through the deception will be her only ones.  Interesting story, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "That would certainly be unfortunate."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor Balis.  It was nice to see you again.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Oh, Charles, I thought you might be interested in this.  It's one of Helen's creations--\"Tempest in a Tea Cup\" or something.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you."}, {"instruction": "Charles!", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Mr. Major.  Roberto.  Won't you sit down?"}, {"instruction": "Did you hear what those assholes did?  You do read the trades magazines, don't you, Charles?  In our business it's critical to read everything and to know just how much credibility to assign to it--so many write out of their assholes.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry?"}, {"instruction": "It's Ellison, that prick.  I mean have you ever heard of anyone doing a take-over by setting up an 800 line to conduct a public opinion poll?  What kind of crap is that?  At least we tried to do it honestly--you know, investment bankers, raising capital, closed door negotiations.  He tried it on fairy dust.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Would you like to sit down?"}, {"instruction": "I think better when I'm pacing.", "input": "", "output": "We're talking about your effort to take over Apple Computer?"}, {"instruction": "Look, I'm a realist.  When my own financial people wouldn't back me up, I knew I was sunk.  But now Apple's putting together a new management team.  They're asking everyone around town.  They asked Ellison, that insincere dick.  They asked Warnock. They asked McNealy. They asked Fisher. They asked Dan Case, for Christ's sake.  What am I, chopped liver?  They don't even have the fucking courtesy to ask me onto their board of directors.  They're trying to put together a think tank so that they can all sit around and watch the company dive into the ground, and the one guy who can really make a difference is left holding his dick.", "input": "", "output": "Aren't you a big stockholder?  Doesn't that give you a seat on the board?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I have less than 5%--it stopped me from having to make some securities disclosures when I was trying my takeover.  Frankly, I'm getting killed in my Apple position.  But I still want to save that fucking company.  It's like I have a mission.  But I apparently don't have enough fucking clout to even get a seat on their board!", "input": "", "output": "Look, this is a little out of my league.  You aren't looking for me to advise you on business, are you?"}, {"instruction": "Fuck that!  I know what my business is.  I'm just a little pissed off, that's all.  You should be able to recognize venting when you hear it, Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, well I agree that it has all the earmarks."}, {"instruction": "Good.  But try to get in some of that bedside manner thing, won't you?", "input": "", "output": "I was just acknowledging that I recognized that you were using me as a sounding board.  Frankly, I'm a bit surprised that you chose me."}, {"instruction": "Well, you aren't the only person who I've been snapping at today.", "input": "", "output": "So why are you here?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, it's my fucking septum.", "input": "", "output": "You figured out what's wrong with your nose?"}, {"instruction": "My nose is the most closely photographed and documented part of my body, Doctor Balis.  I've known about my deviated septum for twenty years.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "I've even had the interactive 3-D fly-through software of nose innards created from the latest CT scan technology.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Any recommendations?"}, {"instruction": "Don't fly through my nose.", "input": "", "output": "No, I meant do the doctors have any recommendations?"}, {"instruction": "The same thing they've been recommending for the last five years--they've only recently developed surgical procedures to deal with my problem.  They want to cut, file, scrape, straighten, and suck out the tissues, cartilage, and bone material that blocks my breathing passages and prevents me from living.", "input": "", "output": "That's great news."}, {"instruction": "Did you hear what I've just said? They want to do Septoplasty, bilateral endoscopic ethmoidectomy, sphenoidotomy, maxilloethmoidectomy, and frontal recess exploration.", "input": "", "output": "Wow.  I'm impressed by your command of medical jargon."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you guys love to throw around that stuff.", "input": "", "output": "I know that jargon is unheard of in the computer profession."}, {"instruction": "Okay, touch\u00e9.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it sounds like you've got a deviated septum and some sinus problems."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's the upshot. As a kid, I broke my nose.  It was left untreated--Hungary was never a great place to get medical treatment.  All these years of pain and total frustration and all because my mother wasn't bright enough to set my nose at the time of the injury.", "input": "", "output": "Are you angry with your mother?."}, {"instruction": "My mother?  You know, sometimes I forget you're a psychiatrist and then you ask me about my mother.  My mother is clueless.  It would be completely unproductive to feel anger towards her.  Not to mention, she's been feeling guilty about this for years.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So why are you avoiding the surgery?"}, {"instruction": "It's the breathing issue.  I'm afraid of not being able to breathe.", "input": "", "output": "But the surgery will improve your breathing--probably quite a bit."}, {"instruction": "No, no.  I mean, sure.  The surgery will fix things after a while.  But there will be days and days where I'll have packing in my nose and I won't be able to breathe.", "input": "", "output": "You mean breathe through your nose?"}, {"instruction": "That's right.  If I can't breathe through my nose, I'll lose my mind.", "input": "", "output": "Have you talked to your doctor about this?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  They just tell me the same things.", "input": "", "output": "Which is?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, they have some kind of packing that has little straws in the middle--it's supposed to help people breathe through the packing.  They say it works about half the time--the rest of the time, it gets clogged up.  But I know what they're really saying.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Look, Charles, I know people...doctors look at me and sense fear.  Fuck, they probably sense insanity when it comes to my breathing.  They'll tell me anything to calm me down.  I'd bet that those straw things are just placebos--they never work.  They're just designed to give people like me hope.  But I'm much much smarter and more educated on this issue than most of the doctors that try to treat me.  I've done research onto this surgery ever since I've heard about it.  I've interviewed patients who've had it done.  None--and I mean not a single person I've talked to, Charles--was able to breathe for almost five full days!", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "The human nose has more blood vessels than almost any other part of the body except the liver.  After the surgery, the nose and all the air passages swell shut.  Those straws in the packings are completely filled with blood.  In fact, there's so much blood that the blood clots form a sizable mass that block the breathing passages and create unbearable pressure inside the sinuses.  I've talked to a guy who had a migraine for the first two days after the surgery.", "input": "", "output": "That does sound very bad."}, {"instruction": "You're great with the understatements, Balis.", "input": "", "output": "So, what can I do for you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm convinced that I need this surgery.  My surgeon said that it will substantially reduce my sinus problems.  When I get a cold or an allergy, everything will drain like it's supposed to and I won't get stuffed up so much.  Basically, the outcome of this surgery would mean freedom to me.", "input": "", "output": "So are you going to do it?"}, {"instruction": "I've got this doctor to set up all the equipment necessary in my home.  She would live with me for the first week after the surgery, or for as long as I feel that I need her to be there.  I would be able to get her to drain and suck out the mucous and blood as it forms.  But even with all of these measures, I would still be trapped without a breathable nasal air passage for a few days and nights.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like that can't be helped."}, {"instruction": "I want you to give me something that would make me not care about the breathing thing.  Something to keep me from ripping my nose off my face during a panic attack.", "input": "", "output": "You want me to prescribe a tranquilizer?"}, {"instruction": "I need to be kept sedated for a few days until I can breathe through my nose again.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, it's not a good idea, Lloyd.  You'll be coming out of anesthesia, and you really don't want any central nervous system depressants--your respiration will really suffer.  And then since you'll be only breathing through your mouth, your respiration will be very shallow.  I think that using tranquilizers then would really be quite dangerous."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.  I hadn't thought of that.", "input": "", "output": "But perhaps we can work on this phobia of yours.  I have to admit that I've never treated someone with the specific problem that you describe, but we can use some desensitization techniques that have worked very well with people with other phobias--including claustrophobics.  I mention them because they often have breathing problems associated with their disorder."}, {"instruction": "Charles, you told me that you can't prescribe me the tranquilizer, and I respect that.  You've got a pretty good reason.  But if you think that I'm going to come in here and have you slowly cut off my breathing so that you can desensitize me, you must be taking too many...", "input": "", "output": "Lloyd, Lloyd, calm down.  You have a problem, and I'm trying to figure out ways that we could solve it without endangering your health."}, {"instruction": "Charles, slowly cutting off my breathing would be the same to me as a death sentence.  I'm really not exaggerating either.  When I try to visualize how it would be, I can understand taking my own life.  Do you understand?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  Perhaps part of the solution could be pain killers--they also have a CNS effect, but it's probably less than a tranquilizer."}, {"instruction": "Yeah?", "input": "", "output": "Some narcotics have an interesting property--it's not that they reduce the level of pain, it's that they reduce the attention span for pain.  If you ask a person in pain who's taking these drugs if it still hurts, they'll think about it and tell you that it hurts just as much.  But after a few moments, they'll be thinking about something else and so the sense of pain will recede into the background.  If you have a headache, and you take ibuprofen, the pain goes away.  If you took one of these drugs, the pain would still be there, but only when you thought about it."}, {"instruction": "Interesting.  You mean if I take these pain killers, I would keep forgetting about my breathing difficulties?", "input": "", "output": "Sort of.  You won't be able to concentrate on thinking about it for long and that might help.  It would also help with the pain and might even help you sleep."}, {"instruction": "I'll have to do some research into this.  What is the name of the medication you're talking about?", "input": "", "output": "I'm talking about oxycodone--like Percocet or Percodan."}, {"instruction": "Wouldn't straight morphine be better?", "input": "", "output": "That's what they'll probably give you in the hospital right after the surgery.  But that's only available as an injectable.  Percocets are pills."}, {"instruction": "I see.  Well thank you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hold on, Lloyd.  Percocets are only part of the solution.  We will need to develop coping strategies for those times when even the Percocets won't keep you from..."}, {"instruction": "Ripping my nose?", "input": "", "output": "Well, yes."}, {"instruction": "What do you recommend, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I recommend we get together in a near future and devote a few sessions to figuring it out.  What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I'll get back to you on that, Balis.", "input": "", "output": "As you wish."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Okay, I got to get back to the Apple stupidity.   Thank you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome.  I hope I can help."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Mr. Major, Roberto."}, {"instruction": "Well, Doctor, you're looking very well.", "input": "", "output": "Mr. Major...Lloyd, please come in. How can I help you today?"}, {"instruction": "Knew I was coming?", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "My secretary never skips a bit.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, he called a few moments ago."}, {"instruction": "Well, good then. Do you mind moving that box of tissues a bit closer, please?", "input": "", "output": "Not at all. Allergies?"}, {"instruction": "They're a killer this season. As much as I'm into it myself, I hate to see all those plants procreating so wildly.", "input": "", "output": "I've heard that El Ni\u00f1o will be bad for allergy sufferers."}, {"instruction": "Bad?", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "That's one of those understatements that I hate so much. Bad. What do doctors really know about what it feels like to suffer from air deprivation? And don't tell me that I can inhale through my mouth.", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't going..."}, {"instruction": "God, what wouldn't I do to be somewhere in Hawaii or even Arizona right now.", "input": "", "output": "So what's..."}, {"instruction": "Work. That's what keeping me here, Doctor. I'm sure you've heard of the little surprise we're planning on announcing next week?", "input": "", "output": "I have a little."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's going to be big, and I've got to hang around here until it happens. We wouldn't want something to go wrong at the last minute, would we?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure your staff is competent enough to take care of any emergency."}, {"instruction": "Perhaps. Do you know something I don't, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure you do. I think I would have enjoyed being a psychiatrist in some other life. To sit back and listen to people open up their souls to me like that...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'm not criticizing your choice of profession, Doctor. In fact, I think it's interesting. Very interesting.", "input": "", "output": "It is. But I'm sure that's not what you came to see me about, is it, Lloyd?"}, {"instruction": "Always to the point.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you have a very busy schedule..."}, {"instruction": "Are you expecting a patient, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "As a matter of fact, I do have someone scheduled thirty minutes from now."}, {"instruction": "Ah.", "input": "", "output": "But I would be happy to set up an appointment with you, if you prefer."}, {"instruction": "No. I'm never sure how my life is going to unfold from hour to hour. I'm sure you can understand that, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Well, we have thirty minutes."}, {"instruction": "Actually, I just came in to blow off some steam, Doctor. It's great to have a company psychiatrist on call just seconds from my office.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad I'm convenient. So what's seems to be the problem?"}, {"instruction": "I had a full blown panic attack about half an hour ago. And I thought of you, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know what precipitated the attack?"}, {"instruction": "It's always the same--breathing, or the lack of it, to be precise.", "input": "", "output": "Can you breathe through your nose now?"}, {"instruction": "No. Well, maybe just a bit. I took some Nasacort and used it in combination with Afrin. It helped a bit.", "input": "", "output": "Nasacort?"}, {"instruction": "It's a steroid in the form of a nasal spray. And Afrin is a nasal decongestant delivered in a similar fashion.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Allergies are not my specialty."}, {"instruction": "I imagine not.", "input": "", "output": "What were the symptoms of the attack?"}, {"instruction": "I felt a large weight...like a giant elephant was sitting on my chest, squeezing the life out of me. It seemed impossible to take a breath. I could feel my heartbeat through my entire body. It felt like my eyeballs were pulsating with every beat. I had a partial loss of vision--everything seemed to get a lot darker and slightly out of focus.", "input": "", "output": "Give me your hand, please. Now, hold on for a minute."}, {"instruction": "I feel more comfortable while we're talking.", "input": "", "output": "I just want to take your pulse."}, {"instruction": "I know. But I think it's normal.", "input": "", "output": "It seems to be. Any other symptoms?"}, {"instruction": "I felt hot and cold at the same time.", "input": "", "output": "Explain please."}, {"instruction": "It was as if my skin got chilled on the outside, but parts of my body got burning hot.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "My underarms felt almost painful, like there were long needles thrust deep into me.", "input": "", "output": "How long did the attack last?"}, {"instruction": "It's hard to judge. As you know, time perception changes radically during episodes like these.", "input": "", "output": "How often do you get these panic attacks?"}, {"instruction": "Too often.", "input": "", "output": "How often is that?"}, {"instruction": "A few times a night. It doesn't happen too much during the day because my mind tends to be preoccupied with other things. In fact, I find that work is one of my only salvations. Entertainment, like movies for example, just doesn't do it--there's too much room for extra processing, so to speak.", "input": "", "output": "I think I understand. So you came here to distract yourself from thinking about your inability to breathe."}, {"instruction": "That's it.", "input": "", "output": "Does it work when you talk about the problem?"}, {"instruction": "Talking about it gives me some form of control over it, I suppose. So it's not a problem. It's letting go that's...it's like falling into an abyss.", "input": "", "output": "What are you taking to relieve your allergy symptoms, Lloyd?"}, {"instruction": "I take Clariton D, a few nasal sprays including the steroids...", "input": "", "output": "I assume Clariton D has a decongestant in it?"}, {"instruction": "It does.", "input": "", "output": "Do you take any additional decongestants?"}, {"instruction": "The spray. But I try to control the impulse for quick relief.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Too much of that stuff only makes matters worse. But I managed to get the company to produce a spray that can be taken every four hours. People like me have to have control, Charles. What good is the medication when you can only use it every twelve hours? My problem requires more action than that.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?  I don't understand."}, {"instruction": "The Afrin people, they only had a twelve hour version.  They thought it was a plus that you'd only have to use the product once every twelve hours.  Well, I know Charlie Drake over at Schering-Plough and I explained the problem.  Now, they came out with a four hour version.  It gives a feeling of having more control.", "input": "", "output": "You managed to get a pharmaceutical company to come up with a new drug that was more to your liking?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't just for me.  I consider it a major victory for humanity. But I can see how you might not see it that way.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's always about control, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel now?"}, {"instruction": "Still a bit off balance, but better.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you'll have another attack?"}, {"instruction": "I will, but it might not happen until tonight. I swear, I feel like tearing out every single tree and blade of grass from the downtown area. I hate open space in the spring.  How much do you think it would cost in political capitol?", "input": "", "output": "I have no idea."}, {"instruction": "So many people would benefit from an allergy safe zone. Well, it's something to think about, although I guess it's not feasible.  Can you imagine just how many critical decisions are affected by presence of allergens in the air? It would clearly be a socially responsible thing to do.", "input": "", "output": "Somehow I just don't see the voters approving a mass plant eradication program in San Francisco."}, {"instruction": "Well, this is the year to do it--more people will feel the debilitating affects of pollen on the human immune system this year than in the last ten.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps. Lloyd, our time is up now. I have a patient waiting for me."}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess this has served its purpose.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to be of help.  It was nice to see you, Lloyd."}, {"instruction": "Sure. And go buy some stock, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks for the tip."}, {"instruction": "Good day.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}]
