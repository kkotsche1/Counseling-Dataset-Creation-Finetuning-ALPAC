[{"instruction": "Peter Hossfeld.  Call me Pete please.", "input": "", "output": "Sure Pete. Is there anything particular you want to talk about, or would you like me to just ask you a few questions to get started?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah, the questions.", "input": "", "output": "I know it can be a little uncomfortable to sit down with a total stranger and talk about all the most intimate issues in your life; but give it a chance--you might be surprised at how helpful it can be. Why don't you start by telling me a little bit about yourself? Let's see, you work at Silicon Impressions as a programmer? How long have you been doing that?"}, {"instruction": "Gosh, it must be four, five years now; ever since I got out of school. But I just started at SII last year.", "input": "", "output": "Do you enjoy programming? Is your work-life satisfying to you?"}, {"instruction": "You're kidding, right? It's a job, that's all. I don't know why I'm doing it. I guess I was smart enough in college so I got pushed into the right classes, and I figured it wouldn't be too hard to get work when I got out, so I went along with it. But no, it doesn't do a thing for me, especially the simple coding I'm doing here. It's like my mind can do it using such a small fraction of its hardware that I've been having out-of-body experiences right in my cubicle. I guess it's a good meditation technique, but it's a little scary.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you came here to see me about?"}, {"instruction": "That and some other stuff too. I figured I've tried everything else, I might as well try Western psychotherapy too.", "input": "", "output": "What else have you been trying?"}, {"instruction": "You name it: Zen, Shiatsu, acupuncture, Hinduism, homeopathy, Rolfing, TM, iridology, colonic irrigation--should I go on?", "input": "", "output": "I think I get the idea. San Francisco is certainly a good area to be exploring that sort of thing. Was there some medical problem that your doctors couldn't help you with?"}, {"instruction": "It's hard to say what's mental, what's physical, and what is spiritual; but the spiritual is definitely missing from Western medicine--not that I'm blaming you personally, Dr. Balis. The medical doctors I went to said there was nothing wrong with me that they could find; they seemed to think I was causing them a lot of trouble for nothing. They just couldn't accept the idea that somebody could be sick without showing a lot of symptoms, ones that they could recognize anyway.", "input": "", "output": "You don't have any physical symptoms, then?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, compared to what? I'm twenty-six years old. I should be overflowing with energy. I should be full of creativity, having the best ideas of my life. I should have figured out some kind of spiritual connection that works for me. I should be at my physical peak. Instead, I'm tired, blocked, lost, and weak. I don't think my body or my mind have broken down or anything, but I don't feel happy or well either. I should be full of enthusiasm, and instead...well, I get jazzed about something for a little while, like I think it's going to change my life, then I just throw it on the heap with all the other shit I've tried. Maybe I expect too much all at once--that's what my irrigator told me--like all these impurities have to come out that have been building up all this time, and you have to expect to feel worse before you start feeling better, but I just keep feeling bad. It's probably my own fault for not sticking with it, but I just couldn't face another session with her. Anyway, one more failure.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you're blaming yourself every time one of these religions or therapies doesn't work out for you, and that makes you feel even worse. Maybe you should give yourself a break, Pete. Nothing works for everyone; everything works for someone. Maybe you're just discovering this for yourself. If a curative effect doesn't show up in double-blind tests, then you're mainly talking about the placebo effect, in any case."}, {"instruction": "That's what you doctors always say; you can't accept something that goes beyond your narrow, linear, left-brain mindset. Don't you believe there's something in people that you can't measure with your machines? Have you really got it all figured out? What about the soul? Can you pluck it out and keep it in a jar?", "input": "", "output": "Take it easy, Pete; I'm on your side. I don't use any machines, we just talk here. It's really a very ancient method of working with the human soul, if you think about it. It's true I trained as a medical doctor, but that doesn't enter into it very much. Sometimes I prescribe certain drugs for certain reasons, just like shamans and healers have always done, but basically this is a talking cure, and it does work if you're willing to meet me halfway."}, {"instruction": "So we talk five or six times and I'm not going to feel lost anymore, I'll be well-adjusted? All this confusion and misery is going to blow away like a puff of smoke, and I'm going to be cured?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm not promising anything; but good things have been known to happen in the course of a therapy program. You may not be ecstatically happy at the end of six sessions, but you might have worked through some of your problems and have gone on to others by then. It's a process of learning about yourself. It isn't focussed on cures per se, although some conditions can be outgrown. The important thing is to get some perspective on yourself, get things started, and see where it leads you. You never know until you give it a try, right?"}, {"instruction": "That's what I said before I dropped acid the first time. I guess this is just another trip, right Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I suppose you could think of it that way, but this isn't a passive sort of experience that just happens to you, it's more like work you need to do. You have to drive the process if you want it to help you. I'm just here to facilitate things and keep you on track. But I'm here to help you if you want to be helped."}, {"instruction": "Help, right. Help comes with every software program, but it's hardly ever helpful. I've written enough of it to know. Do you think it could ever be that simple?", "input": "", "output": "Of course it's not simple. I didn't mean to imply that it was. It's different for every person, that's what makes it interesting."}, {"instruction": "Well I hope all this stuff that's tearing me apart is enough to keep you entertained; I'd hate to think I was boring you with the same old problems you see every day...", "input": "", "output": "Look, this is my job. I do this for my living, and also because I can help people. Whether it's entertaining doesn't really enter into it, but it is interesting to me; I don't think it would work as well if it were not. Do you have a problem with that?"}, {"instruction": "Sorry, I just didn't like thinking I'd be putting on some kind of a show for you, that's all.", "input": "", "output": "You don't need to do anything but be honest . The first thing is to stop worrying about how you're coming off. Just be yourself. This isn't a job interview where you need to impress me a certain way. This is just for you, and you get out what you put in, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, okay. Maybe I'm just over-sensitive. I've put in a lot of time trying for some kind of personal growth, and I feel I'm farther than ever from any spiritual awakening at all. Maybe I'm just stupid, thinking I can be enlightened; maybe I'm just neurotic.", "input": "", "output": "And that's why you came to me, to check on that possibility?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess so. I don't know if I really believe in psychiatry, though, so in a way it doesn't matter what you say. I don't mean to sound disrespectful, I just think you're coming from a really limited world-view, that's all.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure you aren't generalizing in advance of the facts? I don't think we've discussed my world-view yet, that I recall. But let's talk about yours; it seems you have thought about this sort of thing a lot and that's good, even if I won't necessarily agree with you on every point. Let's see. If you don't believe in psychiatry, what do you believe in: God?"}, {"instruction": "Not the old guy with the white beard, if that's what you mean. But if you're talking about the Godhead--a universal spiritual force pervading our souls and connecting us with everything else--then sure, I believe in that. And if I want to get in touch with it, feel its power running through me, does that make me crazy?", "input": "", "output": "Well, we psychiatrists no longer use that word for the various conditions we are called on to deal with, and no, that in itself is not necessarily a sign of mental disturbance. Religious yearnings are perfectly normal, but I'm not sure I'm the person to help you with all this. Maybe you should talk to a priest or a minister..."}, {"instruction": "No, I've had it up to here with organized religion. Everybody just wants to sign you up with their program, and then everything's supposed to be okay, except it's not, it never is. I've been in a lot of cults, I could tell you stories...don't get me started. I just want to get my head together, get out of this state of confusion and despair. Sure, I want to believe in something, I just don't know what it is at this point. There just has to be more to life than eating, sleeping, and going to work, you know what I mean? I feel I'm here for some reason, I just don't know what it is. So I keep trying anything that seems like it's going to lead to some kind of healing, or self-improvement, whatever you call it. And I guess that's why I'm here, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, that's fine. How about coming in once a week? We'll see if we can work through whatever's bothering you. I can't say I've really got a handle on it at this point, but we've made a start. But we're out of time now--let's talk some more. Is the same time next week okay?"}, {"instruction": "Well, if you think it's going to do any good, sure. See you then.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hi Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Hi Pete, how are you doing? Having any more of those strange out-of-body experiences lately?"}, {"instruction": "You can sneer all you want, but astral projection is an important part of a lot of people's spirituality, including mine.", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't sneering, I just asked you about something you said was troubling you. It seemed like the most concrete symptom you were feeling, so I mentioned it. Would you rather talk about something else?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think you give much credence to anything that doesn't fit in your predetermined pigeonholes, so you end up treating things which you don't understand at all like they were symptoms of some disease. Actually, these are the best parts of my day, when they happen. Sure they trouble me; but maybe I need to be troubled.", "input": "", "output": "So what does happen? Could you describe one of them for me?"}, {"instruction": "You're not going to laugh at me, or try to explain them away as some kind of short-circuit in my brain?", "input": "", "output": "I'll try not to prejudge you if you'll do the same for me, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, it's a deal. Look, I guess I'm being a little defensive; I just don't want any more mockery about this. I've taken plenty from my friends already, believe me. Let's clear the air: I don't do any drugs, I hardly ever drink more than a beer or two, I've never been committed to a mental hospital, and I've never been abducted by aliens. But sometimes I seem to slip into a parallel universe.", "input": "", "output": "I promise not to mock you, that's not what we do here. But we can't rule out anything at this point that would help us understand what's really going on. So, could you go into a little more detail about this? I want to hear exactly what happens, minute by minute."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Just the other day I'm sitting in my cubicle trying to do my job, coding in C++. Sometimes my mind gets restless, I guess, and goes somewhere else. Suddenly I'm going down a road in the countryside; It's a glorious day, there's flowers everywhere, and butterflies, and birds singing. I see a valley in front of me with trees, and an old bridge across the end of it. And I start seeing these luminous beings. It's hard to describe them: like pure energy with human shapes. They sort of glide down the road towards me, and one of them passes right through me, and it's this incredible rush--like an orgasm through my whole body. And then I snap back to reality, and I'm sitting there staring at a computer screen again, and some of the guys around me are giving me funny looks.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. You know Pete, this sounds like it could be a dangerous condition we're talking about here. If you don't have any control of when these things occur, you could have a car accident or something. I'd like to order a series of tests, just to rule out the chance of this being epilepsy, a brain tumor, or a hormonal imbalance."}, {"instruction": "Damn it! I knew I was wasting my time talking to you. I thought I told you, this is the best thing happening in my life. If I want anything, I want to figure out how to go there more often, and stay longer. I want to meet those glowing people--I think I really could communicate with them if I had more time. Don't you see how important this is? I'm crossing over to the other side; I'm making contact with the spirit world. How many people have done that? It's an awesome responsibility, and I don't want to blow it. If this is caused by a hormone imbalance, then unbalance me some more! I'm trying to understand this and deal with it; I'm not trying to cure it.", "input": "", "output": "But for me to understand it, I've got to see what it's not, as well as what it is. This could be the first stage of something that might get much worse. I really must insist on some medical tests. It could be that this is a perfectly benign phenomenon, and all we need to do is try and interpret these experiences, and I'll be happy to do that with you. But I told you I'm a medical doctor as well as a psychological counselor; and there are some very serious conditions that can start out by presenting symptoms like yours."}, {"instruction": "Did it ever occur to you that most people who have mystical experiences don't go to doctors about them? This has been going on for thousands of years, and people everywhere are better off because of it happening. I told you last time that I was looking for meaning in my life; now when it looks like I've finally found some, you want to chop it out. I should have known better.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry you feel that way. But I don't see why you shouldn't want to know all the facts about your condition, whatever it is. Nobody is going to force you to have surgery or take any drugs against your will, but if you don't know what's going on, you won't be able to evaluate your options. For some reason, you decided to consult me, and I'm giving you the benefit of my advice. Get the tests done and we can at least see what we're not dealing with. We might be looking at something that's life-threatening, and it's my responsibility to do what I can to save your life. Once that's out of the way, we can talk about the spirit world all you want, all right?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess. But when I came in last week I was just getting my first glimpse. Now it's starting to unfold, and it's so beautiful; I don't even care if I'm dying, if this is where I'm going. To be one of those incandescent souls...", "input": "", "output": "Well let's find out first. You will go in for the tests?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I just said so.", "input": "", "output": "That's great. Now after you had one of these spells, how did you feel?"}, {"instruction": "That's not the great part, I guess I felt a little hung-over.", "input": "", "output": "Headache?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of.", "input": "", "output": "Sweaty?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You said it felt like an orgasm all over. Did you have an actual orgasm?"}, {"instruction": "Uh huh, but that was the least of it, really. It was a total body experience; my genitals just went along for the ride.", "input": "", "output": "I understand what you're trying to say, but it is significant none the less. I'm going to order MRI scans of your brain, as well as some blood work and electroencephalograms. I'm glad you came in, and you really need to follow up on these tests. You are on the company health plan, so there shouldn't be any problem with costs."}, {"instruction": "It sounds like you think this could be really serious.", "input": "", "output": "That's what I'm trying to convey. I'm going to see if we can't get them scheduled right away. Some of these things are best caught in time, and a few weeks can make a difference."}, {"instruction": "What do you think is wrong with me?", "input": "", "output": "I told you I wasn't going to prejudge you, and I don't want to jump the gun. Let's get the results and take it from there."}, {"instruction": "What did you say--epilepsy, brain tumors?  Oh my god. You don't really think that's what's happening, do you?", "input": "", "output": "Probably not. I'm not trying to scare you, but any time there's a periodic loss of consciousness, especially with the autonomic systems involvement you mentioned, we have to check you out. Don't worry, knowing what you're up against is half the battle."}, {"instruction": "There it is, everything's a fight. That's Western medicine in a nutshell. There are places I can go where healing is based on cooperation with the body, not war.", "input": "", "output": "It was just a figure of speech, Pete. Anyway, we're out of time. Wait a second and I'll write out the orders for those tests, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "There you go. I'll make sure we schedule an appointment to discuss the results as soon as they're available."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well I'm going to go to a psychic too. They can zero in on this stuff amazingly fast, and they've got more experience in dealing with the spirit world too.", "input": "", "output": "Just get the tests done anyway. I'll see you next week, probably."}, {"instruction": "Hi Charles. I went for the tests; they gave me this stuff to show you.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, let's take a look. Okay, this is your blood test.  There's nothing abnormal about your blood sugar. Your hormone levels seem all right, and they didn't detect any blood-borne diseases. That's great."}, {"instruction": "What about the other stuff?", "input": "", "output": "Let's see...this is the neurologist's report on the EEG...It says he found some unusual activity, especially during the strobe test. How did you feel when they were doing that?"}, {"instruction": "A little strange, but I don't know if it was the circumstances or the flashing lights or what. It feels weird to have all those wires stuck to your head while they twiddle dials and peer at you. But I didn't trip out or anything. What does \"unusual activity\" mean?", "input": "", "output": "It might be significant or it might not. This isn't a very exact science, a lot of interpretation goes into it. And brain waves vary quite a bit between different people. But they sometimes tell us where to look more closely. Did you go in for the MRI scan yet?"}, {"instruction": "No, they said that next week was the soonest they could fit me in.", "input": "", "output": "Well, you've made a start anyway. I know this isn't exactly what you came to me for; but we have to check these things out carefully. Have you had any more episodes like you were telling me about last week?"}, {"instruction": "Actually no. Maybe I haven't been relaxed enough. The rest of my life seems so shallow and meaningless. But I can't wait. After having had these short glimpses of another world, I want to see more of it, not less. Real life just can't compete. It sucks.", "input": "", "output": "Come on Pete. Is your life really that bad, or is it just disappointing in comparison to your glorious visions?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. If you think of the way most of the people in the world live, I suppose you'd have to call me happy. I'm comfortable; I've got food, clothes, and shelter; nobody's shooting at me; my job's not too hard. I guess I'm better off than ninety percent of the world's population. But it's like when my Mom told me to eat my dinner because kids were starving in Africa--it didn't make the peas and carrots taste any better. Worse if anything.", "input": "", "output": "Is your mother still alive?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah sure. She calls me up once a week or so, asks if I'm eating all right and dressing warm, if I've met any nice girls lately, that sort of thing. But I haven't told her about my out-of-body experiences; she wouldn't know what to make of them and it would just worry her. We keep it pretty light. I don't want her jumping on a plane and rushing to my side. She's got enough to do as it is.", "input": "", "output": "With your father?"}, {"instruction": "No, they split up when I was a kid. She had a pretty rough time of it for a while, but she got married again and I guess she's doing okay. She's got a whole new batch of kids now, so she doesn't have a lot of energy to spare.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still in contact with your father?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't know if he's alive or dead. I guess he must still be alive; I suppose I would have heard something if he'd died. But the break-up was pretty bitter; my mom never got a dime in child support. He just left and that was that. I never got presents from him on my birthdays, or even phone calls. I think he left the country in the late seventies. I don't know if he ever came back. Actually, I don't even care anymore. I wasted enough time on that when I was a kid.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have any brothers or sisters?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my Mom's kids are my half-sisters and a half-brother, but I was pretty much grown up by the time they came along. I never really felt like a part of her new family, but they seem happy enough.", "input": "", "output": "Do you get along with your step-father?"}, {"instruction": "I never really considered him that. But we get along okay, I guess. I was a teenager by the time he got together with my Mom. I couldn't understand what she saw in the guy. I was happy the way things were, just me and my Mom; I suppose I wasn't very friendly to him, and he mostly tried to keep out of my way. It could have been worse, but it was a big relief for all of us when I finally moved out.", "input": "", "output": "So you don't have any family around here; do you have any friends?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah sure. I still have some friends from school that live pretty close--I went to Cal Berkeley, right across the Bay. I don't know if I told you that. And I've met people in some of the classes and workshops I've been to; I keep in touch with some of them. And I know some people from SII, mostly other programmers. We go out for beers after work sometimes, shoot the shit. We keep it pretty light, talking about sports, O.J., that kind of thing. Nothing's worse than programmer's shop-talk--anybody that starts has to buy a round. It's the only reason we don't get thrown out of the bar. We had a Superbowl party yesterday at this sports bar on Lake Merced. Big spread--beer by the barrel and every kind of junk-food you could imagine--but it was just a bunch of geeks packed into a sideshow. The few guys that had actually persuaded women to come to this thing were sort of hovering around them, protecting them from the wolves. I kept rooting for the Patriots to win, even though I knew they were doomed. I guess I'm attracted to lost causes.", "input": "", "output": "At the risk of sounding like your mother, have you met any nice girls lately?"}, {"instruction": "You mean, do I have a girlfriend? Well, there are some women I know well enough to sleep with occasionally.  But no, I'm not really in a relationship. I keep it pretty casual. I guess I'd have to connect with a woman on more levels than just sex if it was to get serious, and...I don't know, these women are my friends. We help each other with our needs, but it's not like I'm in love or anything. I haven't been...oh, since high school anyway. I don't seem to have the energy any more. Maybe I'm just waiting for the right one to come along.", "input": "", "output": "So you haven't given up hope?"}, {"instruction": "You are starting to sound like my Mom. Honestly, I'm fine the way I am. Getting married and all that isn't even on the radar screen. And since I've been tripping out like I have, it doesn't even seem relevant. The psychic said I had a fifty-fifty chance of dying in the next year. Maybe your brain scan is going to pin that down.", "input": "", "output": "I think your chances are much better than that, and you really shouldn't be worrying about dying. I don't know why you're paying for that kind of prediction, how can it be helpful to you?"}, {"instruction": "She says I'm edging into the spirit world, and that can happen when you're getting ready to die, if you are an old soul who has been through a lot of incarnations. It's like it gets easier each time you go through a body, and you start getting more hints and remembering your past lives better. And being able to flash into the spirit world is part of that. It makes sense to me--a hell of a lot more than these brain waves of yours. I'm lucky that I'm getting a chance to get to know Heaven a little at a time. Most people have to face it all at once; they don't have time to prepare themselves. If that's where you go, it's wonderful; I'm looking forward to it. I mean sure, I'm scared, but it's thrilling too. It's such a beautiful place. I know that now...", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think you might be making some erroneous assumptions here? This is not necessarily about dying. There could be lots of other things going on to account for your experiences. The tests don't rule out adult-onset temporal lobe epilepsy. What you have been experiencing might be what used to be called petit mal epileptic seizures. We need some scans to nail this down, and we'll have to consult with a neurologist when it comes to interpreting them. Now this is a serious condition, but it's not the end of the world. There are medications which can control them completely in most people. So you don't need to think you're going to die, if that turns out to be what's going on. The other thing we need to check for is a brain tumor.  A brain tumor sounds really scary but they are very rare in people your age and can often be successfully operated upon."}, {"instruction": "Oh great. I need this like a hole in the head. Can't I just say, okay, my time is up?  That's that, I'm checking out?", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you really want to do? It sounds like you are looking at this from a very strange perspective.  Don't you think your life is worth fighting for?  Isn't it possible that things might be better than you think? Now, so far I haven't given you a diagnosis or prescribed any treatment.  But I want you to know that you are always free to get a second opinion on anything I might tell you. But get it from somebody with some scientific or medical credentials, not from a psychic. All right?"}, {"instruction": "I'll go anywhere I think I can find the truth. And there's truth in a lot of places you've never looked, so you can't say it isn't there.", "input": "", "output": "Well that's an interesting problem in philosophy, but we're about out of time. I'd like to see you again after you have the MRI scans done.  Is that okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, whatever you say.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, well call me when you get the scans and we'll set something up.  Goodbye Peter."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor, uh, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Hi Peter. How are you feeling? I heard you got the scans done."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, here they are. Pretty weird looking. Sort of sickening, looking inside someone's head like that--especially when it's mine. That shot where you see eyeballs popping out of a half-skull; that's really going to haunt my dreams.", "input": "", "output": "Well, try thinking of it as just another way to see yourself; an unusual angle, but nothing to be scared of."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry, I'm not scared. If I was the nervous type, I would have freaked out then and there. I had no idea it would be so damn loud.", "input": "", "output": "What, the MRI machine?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, what a monster. It's like you're being fed into its mouth, and then it starts to roar. I felt like a sacrifice to the Gods of Western medicine.", "input": "", "output": "It's a whole lot better than exploratory surgery; that's what you'd have been looking at ten years ago. Anyway, your neurologist Dr. Hardaway has had a chance to see the scans already; they e-mailed them to his office directly from the imaging center, and I talked to him about them over the phone."}, {"instruction": "That's more than I've done. Isn't technology great?", "input": "", "output": "He wanted to see you and you should schedule an appointment as soon as possible. But in the interest of saving time, we thought we should get these things analyzed as quickly as possible. And the news is good."}, {"instruction": "Really? Do tell.", "input": "", "output": "You don't have a brain tumor. If there had been one, we would have seen it. So you aren't going to die."}, {"instruction": "You have no way of knowing that.", "input": "", "output": "What I mean is that you won't die from a brain tumor in the immediate future. Yes, you could still get hit by a bus. But I was worried about you, and I'm glad to be able to rule this one out. You should be glad too."}, {"instruction": "What about that other thing you were going on about--epilepsy or something?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I was getting to that. I'm afraid the scans could be interpreted either way. One of the temporal lobes does look a bit atypical, like there might be a malformation in one of its convolutions. But there is a certain degree of variation in every brain; unfortunately for us doctors, even typical adult male brains don't all look alike. So while we can't say you've definitely got epilepsy, we can't dismiss it as a possible explanation for what's been happening to you either."}, {"instruction": "That's just great. So what do I do now? Should I start taking medicine for a condition you're not sure I've got? Am I supposed to tear up my driver's license? Are you going to tell my boss I'm an epileptic, so he can fire my ass? I can't tell you how thrilled I am with your \"good news.\"", "input": "", "output": "Look, it could have been a lot worse. I can understand that you feel concerned; let me answer your questions one by one. Okay, as to taking medication, I'm going to leave that to your neurologist; he can talk over the benefits and possible side effects. And no, you're not going to lose your job. For one thing, your medical records are confidential, and also the Americans with Disabilities Act makes it illegal to fire someone because of a medical condition, as long as they are able to do their job with reasonable accommodation on the part of their employer."}, {"instruction": "Uh, this doesn't make a lot of sense to me. If nobody's telling them I have a condition in the first place, can't they just fire me for acting weird?", "input": "", "output": "You are going to have to decide how much to tell your boss. I am keeping all this confidential, I don't know what more I can do. If you want to talk to a lawyer about how to handle the situation, he can probably advise you better than I. What was your other question? Oh yes, your driver's license. I'm going to leave that up to you; there is no law that forces me to report you to the DMV or anything, but I'd be pretty uncomfortable if I felt you were liable to pass out behind the wheel. And I think the last time I renewed my license, there was a question about loss of consciousness that I had to answer under penalty of perjury."}, {"instruction": "I wouldn't call it \"passing out;\" if anything it was a transition to a higher plane of consciousness. And it happened again last week, while I was working on my computer, same as last time. It's never happened in a car, only when I'm at work.", "input": "", "output": "Because it has happened in the past only at certain times or places doesn't mean it will always happen the same way in the future."}, {"instruction": "I thought you would be more help. Do you want to hear what happened or not?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, tell me about it."}, {"instruction": "It was an amazing feeling. It's like suddenly everything in the room was suddenly significant; all the details that I'd just taken for granted started pulsing with inner meaning. It wasn't like an acid trip, things weren't putting out trails or anything when I moved; but when I looked at somebody I hadn't even noticed before, a fellow human being typing away at his desk, he was so beautiful. It's not like I'm turning gay or anything--it wasn't a sexual thing at all. I just recognized him as another spirit, a naked soul seeing another with all the barriers down, pure communication. In fact, even the wastebasket in its shiny roundness, the drapes with their incredible folds, the monitor's magic glow--I'd never felt that way about these things before. But then I wasn't there any more.", "input": "", "output": "Where did you go?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It might have been the same place as before, it might have been a million light-years away. It seemed like a bleak and desolate place. I remember rocks, but no trees. Nothing but spirits going back and forth, like a bus station in the other world. I could see them, and I could see through them at the same time. And the strange thing was, I was a spirit too, just like the rest. When we all moved in the same direction, it was like being part of a river, or the wind. When we flowed apart, I could feel myself being absorbed into the terrain, like rain in the desert. But even that felt right, inevitable, part of the dance. I must be getting ready for rebirth, that's the only explanation that makes any sense. I'm just so lucky to be able to do it gradually like this. Have you ever read the Tibetan Book of the Dead?", "input": "", "output": "I read some of it when I was in college. Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well it talks about experiences like I've been having, closer than anything else I've come across. They call it the Bardo realm, the crossing-ground between life and rebirth. Usually you just go there after you've died, but there must have been other people like me; spirit travelers who went and returned, then told their stories to the people who wrote the book. Maybe there are special meditations for going there whenever you want that I've stumbled across by accident. Maybe there's a mantra hidden in the code I've been using.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe. But you know, I've been thinking about this, and I was wondering--when you have one of these episodes, are you always using the same monitor?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think so.  Why?", "input": "", "output": "Well, remember when you were taking the EEG test, how they were flashing lights at you? It's just speculation, computer monitors flicker at particular frequencies, right? It seems possible that they could trigger epileptic seizures, if you were predisposed to them anyway. Maybe in combination with the fluorescent lighting in the office..."}, {"instruction": "Oh man, why do you have to bring everything to this level? Can't you just admit the possibility of a spontaneous mystical experience, without having to account for it by some sort of mechanical malfunction? First it's my brain that's defective, now it's my computer. Maybe there's nothing wrong with me or my monitor; maybe I'm evolving into a higher type of being. Did you know the Aquarian age just started last week? There are supposed to be some major changes in human consciousness that go along with it; maybe this is a sign of what to expect.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe, but I'd like to try the EEG again, in the place you work. I'd like to see if we can get a reading when you are having one of those episodes; that would really help us tell what's going on."}, {"instruction": "Oh that would be just great. They're already starting to look at me funny as it is; this will really put the icing on the fruitcake. I'll tell you what.  I'll bring the monitor home, and see if I can get anything to happen there, okay?", "input": "", "output": "I suppose. Oh, we're out of time. Well I really think it's important to talk about this some more.  Is next week okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, that's Monday February 17th at 10 am."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  See you.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Peter."}, {"instruction": "Fine. Great.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that. So you haven't been bothered by any more of the seizures we were talking about?"}, {"instruction": "No, I haven't been bothered. I've been learning a lot, but it doesn't bother me; it's confirming a lot of things I'd suspected already.", "input": "", "output": "I don't understand. Are you saying you have been experiencing more of these episodes, but you enjoy having them; or are you talking about learning from the ones you had before?"}, {"instruction": "I have been projecting myself onto the astral plane, but I wouldn't say it was about enjoyment, it's much deeper than that.", "input": "", "output": "You have been doing this at work again?"}, {"instruction": "No. Remember what you were saying last time about the flicker of the monitor maybe having something to do with setting me off? Well I took that monitor home and I worked at it for a while, but nothing happened. I was about to write it off but then I realized I was missing something--a sort of om-m-m that I always heard when my trances would start. So I thought about it, and then went to the hardware store and got a flourescent fixture--bingo. It works even better than it did in my cubicle.", "input": "", "output": "So you managed to induce a seizure at home with this set-up?"}, {"instruction": "Stop calling them seizures. We're talking about a trance state. Somehow I've become able to enter a state of non-ordinary reality and I don't think a medical term like seizures comes close to describing some of the most powerful experiences of my life. And yes, I've used the monitor and light as meditation tools and I've been able to enter the trance state a few times. Mystics have been exploring different realities for thousands of years before doctors had anything to say about it and, if you looked, you'd see this kind of exploration is the foundation of every religion in the world. If a guy named Jacob came to you and told you he'd seen angels climbing a ladder, you'd probably give him some kind of pill to make it stop, wouldn't you?", "input": "", "output": "Possibly. Every case is different. But I think you are messing around with something dangerous here. Epilepsy can creep up on you; once the pathways in the brain are established, seizures...sorry, trances can happen more frequently and severely. This is not something you want to have happen any more, I hope you realize that. If this only happens with this one particular monitor and you've removed it, then we can hope it won't happen again and that's the end of it.  Believe me, that would be wonderful."}, {"instruction": "Look, even after I took all those tests and had my brain scanned, you couldn't say for sure if I had epilepsy or not. So I'm not going to call myself an epileptic. I'm a traveller in different dimensions.", "input": "", "output": "Just because I can't point to some part of your brain and pinpoint what's wrong doesn't mean that the diagnosis is incorrect. Most epilepsies are like that. You can't confirm them until autopsy, and sometimes not even then."}, {"instruction": "I bet you can hardly wait.", "input": "", "output": "Come on Peter. I'm telling you this as someone who cares about you."}, {"instruction": "And it's your job.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it's also my job. That doesn't make it less true. I don't know how to put it more plainly. All I can tell you, based on what I know, is that you seem to be a borderline case, susceptible to epileptic episodes--trances, call them what you like--and you should try to supress them if you can. If avoiding flashing lights and buzzing noises is all it takes, that's fine; but otherwise I'd suggest drug therapy. Have you discussed this with Dr. Hardaway?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't need anything from that old quack. You doctors think you know everything, and you've got the right to tell everyone what to do; even though you're too blind to see the most important stuff in the world.", "input": "", "output": "If you didn't get along with Dr. Hardaway I'd be happy to recommend somebody else you could go to for a second opinion."}, {"instruction": "Right, another guy that thinks exactly the same. Well, no thanks. I've already got a second opinion.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? From whom?"}, {"instruction": "Remember I told you I was going to a psychic? Well she's taken a special interest in my case, and she's put a lot of time into building up my spiritual immunities so I can deal with the incredibly heavy shit that's been coming my way on the spiritual plane. In fact it's her support that has kept me as strong as I've managed to be, and helped me keep to the path.", "input": "", "output": "This is the one who said you were going to die?"}, {"instruction": "She said there was a strong chance of it, with the powerful forces I've been invoking. She thinks I can pull through though, with her help. She's doing everything she can to build up my strength.", "input": "", "output": "Really? What does she do?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want to hear you making fun of things you can't understand.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not making fun, I just want to know. Call it professional curiosity. I need to build people's strength up too at times; maybe she's developed a technique I could use."}, {"instruction": "Uh, I don't think so. It has a lot to do with her female energy. You see, I've got strong male energy that needs to be directed; but only the female can do that.", "input": "", "output": "I guess that leaves me out. Was she ever with you when you induced your trance states?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, she helped a lot. She's an amazingly wise woman. She has an herbal tea for just about any problem you could name, she can cast horoscopes, read the tarot, you name it. When I broke through, it was probably the breathing exercises she taught me that got me there, and afterwards it was her massages that brought me back.", "input": "", "output": "It does sound like she she is putting in a lot of effort. What did you say her name was?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't say. Her name is secret; she only tells it to people who need to know. But she lets people call her Serena.", "input": "", "output": "Did she tell you her true name?"}, {"instruction": "I was granted that honor. But I can't reveal it.", "input": "", "output": "Then I won't ask you to. Is there anything about her that you would like to tell me? What does she look like?"}, {"instruction": "She's got dark brown hair, eyes like deep black pools. I guess she's really a pretty small woman, but she's got this huge aura surrounding her so she seems larger. She must be forty at least, but she's still muscular and firm. Really though, it's her soul that hits you; the body seems like it can hardly contain it. You'd have to meet her to understand what I'm talking about.", "input": "", "output": "And she's been coming over to your place regularly to give you special counseling, that sort of thing?"}, {"instruction": "House calls may be extinct in Western medicine, but they're still an important part of alternative treatment.", "input": "", "output": "So she comes over, tells your fortune, gives you tea, massages, and spiritual advice, while you experiment with your consciousness?"}, {"instruction": "She's become my teacher and spiritual guide, I guess you could say. I'd really be lost without her, that's for sure, trying to deal with these intense cosmic forces. But she knows how to cope with all the entities I've been channelling and she's got ways to infuse me with some of her power when the time comes for me to cross over.", "input": "", "output": "How does that work?"}, {"instruction": "Ever heard of Tantra? It's a magical system worked out thousands of years ago in Asia by highly advanced yogi who were totally at home in different dimensions that we just get glimpses of today. Just by using our bodies in certain ways, we can attune ourselves to the spiritual elements that reach inside us and connect with everything in nature, including entities science has no clue about.", "input": "", "output": "I've heard of Tantric sex. Is that what you've been doing?"}, {"instruction": "This is as different from what you call sex as flying is from walking. There's no way to explain it; it's like trying to tell a deaf person about music. For one thing, the object is totally different. In sex, the main thing the man is trying to do is to bring himself off, and maybe the woman too if she's lucky; in tantra, for me to have an orgasm would be an admission of failure. The idea is to transcend the material plane totally, while balancing the male and female principles exactly, so the energy is conserved and channelled upwards. I can't tell you how lucky I am to have finally found someone who could show me these things.", "input": "", "output": "Are you in love with this woman?"}, {"instruction": "My god, one outdated Western concept after another! Romantic love, what a side-track. Let me tell you, this is something totally different and infinitely higher.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Well, we're out of time, but I'd like to talk to you some more. How about next week?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I'm really feeling okay and I've been awfully busy. I'll think about it, how about that?", "input": "", "output": "Give me a call when you want to set up an appointment, but I think it's important."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you again pretty soon, don't worry.", "input": "", "output": "I'll try not to. Goodbye Peter."}, {"instruction": "Hi Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Ah Peter.  Hello. How are you?"}, {"instruction": "Some things are going great, others not so good.", "input": "", "output": "Do I get the good news first or the bad?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, let's do the good news. I'm really making progress on the astral plane.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? What kind of progress?"}, {"instruction": "It's like exploring another world--a different dimension of reality. Different rules apply, but I'm learning them. I'm getting more control. I can fly now.", "input": "", "output": "Fly? In your dream?"}, {"instruction": "It's not a dream, it's a vision, a quest. And yes, since you aren't dragging a body around with you, you can flow through the atmosphere quite easily.", "input": "", "output": "You say you're on a quest. What for?"}, {"instruction": "There you go again, linear thinking. Can't the quest be its own object? Does there always have to be a definable goal? What if I tell you that I'll know when I get there?", "input": "", "output": "That's okay with me. I was just asking if you had some plan in mind, somewhere you were going with all this. Your answer, I take it, is no. That's fine. I'm not here to pass judgment, I'm just trying to help you with whatever's troubling you. But I've got to tell you I have a problem with the recreational use of epilepsy, even if you don't. This is not something to mess around with, believe me."}, {"instruction": "This sounds like what people have told every explorer since time began. \"You'll get eaten by a bear,\" \"You'll fall off the end of the earth,\" \"There's no such thing as e.s.p.\" But I happen to know you're wrong. Don't you think there's a reason why epileptics have been oracles since the beginning of time? I've been reading up on this--did you know Julius Caesar was an epileptic? Maybe that had something to do with why he always won his battles. No great feat for a time-traveler, is it? There's no way you can push your limited world view on me, now that I've seen what I've seen. I've been places, done things in what you call my dreams, things you couldn't even imagine.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "You want me to tell you about one that just happened?", "input": "", "output": "Please, if you don't mind."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'm there in the other dimension and I see something: sort of a flickering form of light, moving, flying above me, around me. I follow it. I'm led on a weightless dance--pure movement without the body's drag. It's the most wonderful thing I've ever done, soaring and plunging over a terrain of pinnacles and pastel clouds. We start glowing, light pours from our centers with brilliant-colored pulses. Plumes of energy like solar flares interlace between us. And then a figure starts to materialize from reflections of light, hazy at first, then more distinct. I can see it's a woman and I realize that my body is reappearing as well. We reach out to each other, but I'm being drawn back into my body, and just as I look into her eyes, the whole scene starts to fade and I'm back in front of my monitor with Serena holding my hand and looking at me.", "input": "", "output": "Was she the woman you saw in your vision?"}, {"instruction": "No, not at all. This was someone totally different. It seemed she had something to say to me, but I was pulled away before she could say it. I think Serena pulled me back on purpose, like she sensed a threat. Sometimes it seems like I'd be better off going on by myself, but she knows a lot more than me about the entities I have to deal with out there. And she told me herself that the only reason I'm having such good experiences is because of her protective powers. There's a lot of heavy stuff you've got to deal with if you're on the astral plane a lot and I guess I need all the help I can get. But I wish I could have stayed just a little longer...", "input": "", "output": "It's probably a good idea to have somebody present when you're doing this, if only to call the paramedics in an emergency. I've got to say I'm worried about you and I think you should seriously consider dropping this practice if you want to preserve your health in the long term. With luck, you might not have seizures any more if you don't provoke them like you've been doing; you could be just fine, even without drugs. Go on like you have and you may find you can't control them any more."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all before. Can't we just say that your idea of what life can be differs from mine and leave it at that? What about my vision? Can you blame me for not wanting to give up something so beautiful? And for what, to be a cog in the SII machine? Give me a break!", "input": "", "output": "Look, I'm not putting down your vision; if you say it was beautiful, I believe you, all right? What about the rest of your life?  This was just the good news. What bad things happened?"}, {"instruction": "It's not like that. Nothing terribly bad, just petty material-plane stuff. I hate getting bogged down in this emotional shit. It's amazing that you can connect with someone on some levels so well, and on other ones not at all. Like Serena--such a wonderful teacher and guide--but she was starting to act like we were married or something. Always being there when I came home--I 'd given her a key to my place--and she started cooking and cleaning up and she even moved some of her stuff over. I tried to explain to her that I considered her a valuable helper and everything, but that I didn't want to bring our relationship down to the level of daily life, you know? She got really pissed off, started telling me how all my exploration has been at her expense and I've been using up her psychic powers. I tell her I don't know how I'm supposed to have done that. Then she starts throwing the sex thing at me, telling me I'm using her without giving her my male energy--the whole tantric deal was her idea in the first place. Well I got her calmed down, but not before she'd screamed a bunch of stuff at me, like how I'd better treat her right or she'd put some kind of curse on me! So I couldn't tell her I needed more space. She's in my life as much as ever. She's starting to give me orders too: little stuff, like go there, do this, but not asking me if I'd like to, telling me. Then she stares at me with those big green eyes, like she's hypnotizing me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you do what she tells you?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I do. It's easier than arguing with her. She's got a wicked temper.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you think so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she's a very proud woman. She knows she's something special and expects to be treated that way. If she gets crossed in the smallest thing, she flies into a rage--you know there's nothing she wouldn't do, she gets really wild. Not that she's always biting and throwing things, but I've seen her give out a look that's pure poison. Have you ever heard of malocchio, the evil eye? Maybe you thought it was superstition, but I know for a fact that it's real. A guy came over--a friend of mine from work--and I don't know, maybe he'd had a drink or two, and we started talking about Serena. He's saying stuff like, \"Why don't you dump that withered old cunt?\" And suddenly she's standing there, with this terrible expression on her face. I guess she was in the bedroom listening the whole time. So he splits real quick, but the next day he doesn't come to work. We hear he's been in this auto wreck and put his head through the windshield of his car. Yesterday he came back, bandages all over his face; you can tell he'll never look the same.", "input": "", "output": "The fact that a man who'd been drinking got in a car accident doesn't prove anything to me about the evil eye, But I don't want to waste our time arguing about this, we're not going to settle the issue in any case. If you believe in the evil eye, then that's what counts here, not whether I do or not.  Are you really afraid that this woman could harm you by psychic means?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I know she could. It's a question of whether she would want to. She seems very attached to me in her way. I'm just not sure I want to make the kind of commitment she's demanding. It seems that the Forces are leading me in a different and higher direction, someplace she could never follow. But how do you tell someone that they were just a stepping stone?", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes you have to tell people things they don't want to hear, Peter. It's part of being honest. Don't you think you owe it to her, and to yourself, to communicate truthfully about how you feel? I'm sure you can put it in a way that spares her feelings."}, {"instruction": "You don't know her. She's real sharp when it comes to figuring out what you're trying to say, and stripping away all the nice parts. Remember, she's psychic. You have to be very careful what you say to her. But I think you're right, I'm going to have to put some boundaries on our relationship or she'll take me over body and soul. Thanks for the pep talk.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to be able to be helpful to you. I must confess I'm out of my depth when it comes to psychic phenomena. But I know a lot about people and their relationships, so maybe that's what we should concentrate on next time, okay?"}, {"instruction": "I'm just feeling comfortable with you and you go and say something like that. What makes you think that people can be separated from the major forces of the universe, the most important stuff of all? Doesn't your brain ever feel uncomfortable in its chains?", "input": "", "output": "I could ask you the same thing. But we're out of time.  I don't know why you feel you have to convince me about your beliefs.  Are you really trying to evangelize me into a belief in psychic phenomena?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe I'm just trying to compensate for your unswerving belief in western science and technology.  I'll be back next week, psychic phenomena and all. And I'll let you know how it goes with Serena.", "input": "", "output": "That'll be fine.  I'll see you then."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Peter."}, {"instruction": "Hi, I'm back.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it's been a while since you've come in. Is there some special reason you've decided to see me today?"}, {"instruction": "I feel you're my only hope, you know, like that last straw people grasp at before they go down for the third time?", "input": "", "output": "How so? I thought you were a happy camper. What's the matter?"}, {"instruction": "Oh god. I shouldn't even be thinking these thoughts. She's going to find out. She always finds out.", "input": "", "output": "Wait a minute, catch me up here; what thoughts, and who are you talking about?"}, {"instruction": "You know; Serena. She's psychic, remember--she knows what I'm thinking. She can tell if I'm planning to escape.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you want, to escape from her?"}, {"instruction": "No, it's not possible. And she's going to know I told you this. And she's going to make me sorry.", "input": "", "output": "Peter, you're a grown man. If this relationship isn't working for you then call it quits, or at least set some limits that you feel comfortable with. You've got to know that this person doesn't have any more control over you than you give her."}, {"instruction": "Things are so simple for you; I almost envy you your security. But my world has different rules, and it's not so safe. Greater possibilities, bigger pitfalls.", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think you might be romanticizing a bit? Come down to earth for a second. You've gotten involved with a woman who wants more commitment than you are willing to give. This isn't exactly unprecedented; why do you have to bring the paranormal into it? If you aren't comfortable with the situation, then be honest with her and see if you can come up with an arrangement that works for both of you. Why not leave the astral plane out of it and deal with each other like two ordinary people--what's wrong with that?"}, {"instruction": "You're so dense, I don't know why I keep coming back here. I must be really desperate. Let me try to explain this one more time. We're not talking about an ordinary woman here; this is a very powerful entity which has chosen a woman's shape. If I'm not extremely careful here, my soul will be lost forever. There are some very bad places on the astral plane; I've been to some of them and it's really not pleasant. I'm walking on the thin edge between this world and the next, and it just takes a little push...", "input": "", "output": "I thought you were only having good experiences; what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she said I needed to do some past-life work, that there were some things I'd left undone that were still holding me back karmically.", "input": "", "output": "So what did you do?"}, {"instruction": "The usual thing; regression, rebirth, re-entry.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "It's like a guided trip; with somebody to help you, it's not that difficult to go back to where you came from. And Serena's very good at this; she used to be a rebirth counselor, somebody who specializes in karmic cleansing. She structures your energy so it's easy to flow back to your roots. She starts talking in a special way, you can tell she's summoning a spirit-being, and you look in her eyes, and--I don't know, suddenly you're in a different space and time.", "input": "", "output": "You mean it's like hypnosis?"}, {"instruction": "That's probably the closest thing to it you can understand, but it's a lot more powerful than the tricks you see people do on stage. It's the difference between Merlin the Sorcerer and David Copperfield. You actually experience parts of the different lifetimes that made your spirit what it is, and some of the stuff that's still holding you back...", "input": "", "output": "And was that the bad part you mentioned?"}, {"instruction": "It was horrible. At first, all I could focus on was the pain, just waves of pain. Then I was in a room, and a guy was tied in a chair, and these guys in uniforms were hurting him, torturing him. They were shouting at him in German, but whatever he said, they didn't like, and hit him again. The man was weak, on the point of passing out, but they poured water at him and kept at him. And I understood the German words, and I found myself saying them, shouting them, and my arm was going back and forth with the effort of beating this helpless man. I was an interrogator for the Gestapo--I felt the sting in my knuckles; I can still see that man's bloody face...", "input": "", "output": "So you think that because you had this terrible vision under hypnosis, that you were a Nazi in a previous lifetime?"}, {"instruction": "I was there. I know what I did. What I don't know is how I'm going to deal with that karma. I feel awful just thinking about it.", "input": "", "output": "Why worry about it? Don't you think it's more important to focus on the lifetime you're in right now?"}, {"instruction": "Of course; I'm not disagreeing with that. But knowing how you failed before can help keep you from blowing it this time around, don't you think? I suppose the message is not to be cruel. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "I'd rather hear why you like to spend your time escaping into one kind of fantasy or another and ignoring what's actually happening in your life."}, {"instruction": "Oh wow. I bet you've been saving that one up for a while. Feel better now? I'm glad I helped you get it off your chest.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I'm sorry. I know I seem hopelessly rationalistic to you, but I think that might be why you keep coming back."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you're my earth anchor. Sometimes I feel like I'm floating away, and I ask myself, \"What would Doctor Balis say\" and the answer: \"Come down to Earth, Peter\" and I go \"Aye-aye Sir!\" and you know--it sort of works.", "input": "", "output": "Why thank you, that's a testimonial of sorts. But really, you like to cast me as a spokesman for Western Rational Thought, which is not how I usually conceive of myself. Now I can tell you feel the need for something like that, so I try to play my part, okay? But I'm not unsympathetic towards your beliefs by any means; I just want to make sure you think clearly about what you are doing in the here and now."}, {"instruction": "Right, the good old here and now. Which in my case means Serena, and why I have to do everything she tells me and why I have to tell her everything that I'm thinking, and where I'm going, and where I've been, and who I saw, and what they said, and what I thought about what they said--it's too intense for me. I just can't be around her this much. Somehow I'm going to have to get some extra powers, strong enough to hold her off...", "input": "", "output": "You don't think you can do it on your own?"}, {"instruction": "I may be spaced out these days, but I'm not crazy. She'd eat me alive and spit out the bones! You don't know what you're telling me to do.", "input": "", "output": "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned?"}, {"instruction": "I really don't want to find out. I'm going to have to make up an hour's worth of conversation we just had on a totally different subject, so I can tell her about it. It wears me out. Having any social life at all is pretty much impossible. She hates to go out, except on the nights she goes to her meetings, and they're for women only. None of my friends come by any more, I don't know why. If it wasn't for my dreamwork--and she's real important for that, and has done me a lot of good by showing me some of the things I'm responsible for--but if it wasn't for the work, I wouldn't have anything at all.", "input": "", "output": "Oh really? You're young, healthy, smart, employed--what do you want? I can't help but think you are building this person up in your mind as a figure of vast power and influence in heaven and on earth, when she's probably just a lonely woman who clings a bit too tightly, and needs to be told in a nice way that people sometimes need some more time alone in their personal space."}, {"instruction": "I like the sound of that, it sounds so impersonal. But she thinks that since she's my guru, it's up to her to decide how much time I spend doing what and where. The guru has to have total control, that's the way it works.", "input": "", "output": "Does she have to be your guru? Can you quit?"}, {"instruction": "And throw away everything we've worked so hard to build up? We're really making progress with the astral projection, and I don't know where else I'd go for the past lives work, although there's supposed to be a guy in Colorado.... She's a really good teacher and guide. I guess this is bad to say, but I just wish she wasn't so interested in my case.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you think she's interested in?"}, {"instruction": "What, you think she's lusting after my bod? That stuff is just so trivial and unimportant.", "input": "", "output": "Some people don't think so. Anyway, we're about out of time. Are you coming back next week?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, it's sort of difficult to get away. I mean, I can ask, but maybe the week after...", "input": "", "output": "Well give me a call. I think you should try and make it."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doctor, I'll try. See you.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Peter."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Peter, it's good to see you again--and something of a surprise as well."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, sorry about last time--in the hospital, I mean. Serena sometimes is not really tactful around strangers, but she had a lot on her mind right then.", "input": "", "output": "I suppose she did at that. Where are you at about becoming a father?"}, {"instruction": "It still feels strange to me. I never thought that anything like that was going to happen--what we were doing was more like yoga than sex--I still don't understand it; I never had an orgasm or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's not strictly necessary in order for conception to occur, although it makes it much more likely. How old is Serena?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not really sure; about forty, I guess. That's still young enough for a woman to have kids, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, it happens a lot these days. There are some increased risks, but nothing major assuming proper pre-natal care. Is she getting any?"}, {"instruction": "She doesn't tell me anything about her private life; we're not on that kind of footing. But I guess this changes things, us having a kid together...", "input": "", "output": "So you're going to keep the baby?"}, {"instruction": "Oh gosh, I suppose so. Whatever she decides. I mean it's all the woman's choice, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Have you told her how you feel about it?"}, {"instruction": "God, I'm in enough trouble already without stirring up any more.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of trouble? About coming in to see me after all this time?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no, I'm not going to tell her about this--I just needed some help, and I thought of you. I hope you didn't mind the short notice?", "input": "", "output": "No, I was really glad to be able to see you again; I was worried about you. But if you could schedule your regular sessions again, that would be great."}, {"instruction": "Look, I'll be in touch about it. Anyway, where was I?", "input": "", "output": "You were saying you were in some kind of trouble?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. I couldn't help it, I had to see her...", "input": "", "output": "Who, Serena?"}, {"instruction": "No, Eliza. I actually asked her to come over--I don't know how I could have been so stupid. All I could think about was how I needed her, how I had to have her near me. I should have at least asked her to go to a movie, or on a walk, or something. I mean, at first it was wonderful; her presence is so comforting to me, and it just feels so right when we're together. We even took a walk on the astral plane together, hand in hand in a beautiful garden...", "input": "", "output": "So what went wrong?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when we came back to earth...or maybe it was before that. Anyway, there we were in the yard in back of my place--there's a little piece of ground the tenants can grow things in if they want. But actually, nobody had the energy for it until Serena came--she has a sort of a green thumb, you know, and she made that place come alive with all this stuff, it was really pretty amazing. But Eliza starts looking at the plants out there, and she's freaking out, you know? I mean, I don't know anything about plants, they all look the same to me. But Eliza, she's running around from one to the other, screaming stuff like: \"Foxglove! Henbane! Jimson weed! This is poison! Pure poison!\" And she's ripping all these plants down, and pulling them up--I tried to stop her, but she wasn't into listening at all--she's scattering all these bundles of dried stuff around, and then she goes into the kitchen and it's the same thing. She's like a whirlwind, dumping all of Serena's jars of herbs in the garbage and yelling, \"Thorn apple, Lovely lady! You know what these things really are?\" And I didn't know what to do; I'd never seen her like that, and I started feeling really weird, you know, like I had to sit down and put my head between my legs and breathe really slowly. So she comes over and kisses me; then she leaves. At least I think she left then--these seizures have really been messing with my mind, you know? But I remember kissing her before she left. It felt so wonderful. I've never dreamed anything that good, so it must have been real, right?", "input": "", "output": "Are you having trouble telling reality from fantasy lately? Or are we talking about a memory problem here?"}, {"instruction": "Gee, I don't know. I've been taking these pills they gave me at the hospital, but they make me feel all fuzzy. Fuzzy mind, fuzzy gums, and a funny taste in my throat, if you know what I mean. And I still space out a lot. I don't know, maybe I do have memory problems. But I don't recall forgetting anything lately.", "input": "", "output": "What about on the job? Are you functioning normally there?"}, {"instruction": "I guess it has been a little strange at work. Sometimes I find myself just sort of staring at the monitor, and all the other programmers are pretending not to notice. I've been getting this really fishy feeling from my supervisor, like he's been told not to react to anything I might do, however weird. I don't know why they haven't fired me yet, honestly. I'm getting nothing done, and this millenium thing is going nowhere. But I'm the guy who's been wrestling with it for the last six months, so they figure they'll lose six months getting a new guy up to speed. Then it would be 1998, with no code written and the big time-bomb ticking down. I think they're hoping I get it together real quick, then they can dump me in the next big downsizing they do.", "input": "", "output": "Come on, Peter. Maybe you're a valuable employee who's having some health problems, so they're cutting you some slack. But yes, I hope you pull yourself together soon too. Is there anything the matter with that?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay. Maybe I was being paranoid, and everybody's not out to get me. Sorry, I suppose I feel insecure about suddenly being an epileptic. I even had to give up my driver's license--you can't get anywhere without a car around here. I guess I never felt like a less than normal person before, and it's hard to get used to.", "input": "", "output": "I can understand that. It's always painful to have to adjust one's self-image when one's circumstances change for the worse. But as I remember it, you get your license back if you use medication and stay seizure-free for a year or so."}, {"instruction": "So in the meantime, I can experience the joys of Bay Area public transportation. It must be my karma. Oh yeah, I was telling you about what happened the other night, wasn't I?", "input": "", "output": "After Eliza left?"}, {"instruction": "When Serena came back.", "input": "", "output": "So what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Have you ever heard of the Goddess Kali? She wears a necklace of human heads, and dances on the bodies of her victims. She must have been channeling a really wrathful incarnation of the Goddess, or maybe she was possessed...", "input": "", "output": "What did she do?"}, {"instruction": "When she came in, I was lying on the couch, feeling really out of it. She could see her herbs and stuff sticking out of the garbage can, like Eliza had left them. She started screaming, \"Who did this? Who dared to do this to me?\" She went into a kind of a frenzy, punching with her fists and kicking at me with the points of her shoes. Then she was running all over the place, sort of sniffing in all the corners; and when she got to the garden, she let out this awful howl, the kind that just freezes your bones. Apparently, by arranging some sticks and rocks, Eliza left some kind of sign there. I hadn't even noticed it before, but Serena turned ghastly pale when she saw it, and her hand was actually shaking when she pointed at it and said, \"It was she, wasn't it? She did it all! Even this!\" And then she hits herself in the belly. Do you think she was talking about her pregnancy? I mean, how can she blame Eliza for that, of all things? So anyway, I go up to her, and start sort of smoothing the hair out of her face, stroking her brow, trying to calm her down, and she glares at me, grabs my hand and bites it really hard. Then she leaps up, looks around wide-eyed like a startled cat, and rushes out without another word. The strange thing is it's almost a week now and I haven't seen her since. I'm really starting to get worried. I mean she hasn't even come by for her stuff or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Is that the hand, the one with the bandage? Can I take a look at it?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. It's kind of gross though.", "input": "", "output": "Uh, Peter, have you taken this to a doctor yet?"}, {"instruction": "No, why?", "input": "", "output": "This is showing signs of infection, and you really need to have it taken care of."}, {"instruction": "Like maybe a comfrey-leaf poultice?", "input": "", "output": "I was thinking more in terms of the emergency room. Human bites can be extremely dangerous, and this needs treatment now."}, {"instruction": "Not back to the hospital--I just got out!", "input": "", "output": "That's another reason for concern; you're in a vulnerable condition right now, so you have to be extra careful. I'll tell you what. I know a few good general practitioners. I'm sure I can get one of them to slip you into the schedule right now, would that be okay?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so, but I don't think it's that big a deal, really. It hardly hurts at all. I just can't believe she's really gone. And I mean, like what about the baby?", "input": "", "output": "Well, like you said, it's the woman's choice. And it may be that she was mistaken about the pregnancy in the first place, or she miscarried--there's not too much you can do if she chooses not to communicate with you, so don't worry about it. Let's see what you can do about putting yourself back together--starting with that hand, all right?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, okay, whatever you say, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "We're about out of time, but give me a couple of minutes to make a couple of phone calls and hook you up with a doctor who can treat that hand of yours. It's really good to be seeing you again--I hope you can keep coming back."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, me too. I'll wait out here while you call.", "input": "", "output": "Great.  I'll just be a minute."}, {"instruction": "Oh god, what a week!", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "My life has absolutely gone to hell, and I mean it literally.", "input": "", "output": "How so? I thought things were looking pretty positive for you, last time we spoke."}, {"instruction": "You would, I suppose. But here I've lost my guru, lost my lover, and lost my job--and I feel like I'm losing my mind.", "input": "", "output": "Wow. I knew about your guru, but the rest...I'm sorry I was out last week. I had to take some time off for a family situation. But let's talk about some of this. Your lover, your job, and your mind? How did you lose your job? Did they give any explanation?"}, {"instruction": "Well, sort of. They'd been putting in crappy performance evaluations for a while, just to cover their butts, but it's like as soon as they knew I was sick, that I had something they could pin a name on, that's when they pounced. I mean, I thought they were trying to be extra nice, and accommodate whatever problems I was having. And I was feeling bad about letting the side down and all--I was really trying to pull it together in the last week or so, to make up for lost time and get the project back on track. But somebody in upper management must have said \"Fuck it. Can his ass.\" So they call me in and give me all this mealy-mouthed mumbling about how I wasn't meeting productivity goals--I mean, Jesus, I was in the hospital, what did they expect? But there was nothing about recognizing that I'm a human being, not one of their damned machines. They made out like it was nothing to do with my condition--they just had to cut some payroll expenses, you-know-how-it-is. They even said they'd hire me back if things picked up--what a load of bull. The project they had me working on had nothing to do with their fluctuating fortunes. It was the millennium bug, for God's sake. What does that have to do with things picking up? It's coming down regardless--don't they realize that? But it was like they were reading a script--and they didn't even have the courtesy to write a new one for the occasion. They just read me an old form letter they had lying around.", "input": "", "output": "That's certainly bad news. How did it make you feel, being fired?"}, {"instruction": "Totally worthless. I mean, what am I good for, if I can't even keep a job? If you don't have money coming in, you're shit on the street. Nobody wants to come near you. You're not going to be seeing me anymore either, because I've lost my coverage.", "input": "", "output": "Your insurance will continue for awhile under Cobra, so I'm sure we can keep these sessions going for at least three months, and I'm confident we can work something out afterwards. I really don't think you need to worry about being able to get a job, either. From what I hear, companies are fighting each other to get experienced programmers--you should be fine. But how are you feeling physically? You look better than the last time I saw you. Are you taking your medication?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, when I sweat I medicate my shirt. I'm taking anti-seizure stuff, and antibiotics for my hand. But I don't know...", "input": "", "output": "Are you having any more seizures?"}, {"instruction": "How should I know? I wake up feeling like I've been kicked in the head. Did I space out or is it just the meds? I never remember the seizures themselves, just what I was feeling right before--sometimes it's really beautiful...", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I remember you started out inducing them deliberately. I thought the romance had worn off, though."}, {"instruction": "Oh, don't worry, I'm being a good boy, taking that poison every day. And it's kind of interesting riding a bike everywhere in this town. As if the hills weren't enough, now we've got cars and cyclists mixing it up in the streets, with this Critical Mass thing--somebody tried to kill me with their car last Friday, guess he thought I was some kind of activist or something. I felt like telling him, \"Hey man, I'm a driver too, I just can't use my car right now.\" I mean, I could relate to where his rage was coming from, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Uh, let's try and avoid the most intractible political problem of our day and keep the focus on your major problems, okay? You said you thought you were losing your mind. What do you mean by that?"}, {"instruction": "I guess it sounds strange coming from me, huh? You never thought I had much of a brain to start with, did you?", "input": "", "output": "Come on, Peter. You know that's not true. While I may not agree with you on everything, I've always respected your intelligence. Why don't you tell me what the problem is?"}, {"instruction": "It's like I've got Alzheimer's or something. I can't remember things, and when I try, everything's all screwed up. You know those consciousness-expanding guys, always saying that you only use ten percent of your brain power? I think I'm down to about two percent--just one step above a cauliflower. I feel so goddamn stupid, no wonder they fired me.", "input": "", "output": "There's no need to beat yourself up over that. Tell me what you did that was so stupid?"}, {"instruction": "Well, since I got back, I didn't think I was doing so badly at the job thing this last couple of weeks. Programming's something you don't need much brain at all to do, just a little pea-sized lump the size of a rat's brain. And I was tuned into it, my little rat-brain was humming down the maze like a good little rodent--all I want is my food pellets, honest. Oh, yeah, you want to talk about stupid? I was really touched at the concern they seemed to show. Okay sure, it was obvious I hadn't been pulling my weight, but they were being so nice about it. It made me want to try harder. it really did. Then--wham. I'm out on the street going, \"Duh. What did I do?\"", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "You mean afterwards? I guess I just wanted to crawl into a hole. I never thought something like this would affect me; I know it's all just an illusion anyway. But then, I've never been fired before. I try to meditate, and the same scene just keeps repeating itself like a mantra. I can't get past it, no matter how I dodge around in my mind.", "input": "", "output": "Relax, it's perfectly normal to have unwelcome thoughts recur. It's how your brain processes traumatic events. If you don't fixate on them, they will fade away. But what's this about \"losing your lover.\" Are you talking about Serena?"}, {"instruction": "We weren't lovers, I told you that. And that's what I tried to tell Eliza. But she kept on about her \"evil influence\" and \"herbal poisons\" and how I'm so lucky she's gone. I mean, that woman did a lot for my spiritual growth, but Eliza gave her no credit at all. And aware as she is in lots of ways, she absolutely refuses to admit that she knew me before--or anything about our past life together in Babylon. After I worked so hard to get it all figured out, I can't understand why she won't help me heal my karma. All she wants to talk about are her terrible feelings about herself. Then when I try and contradict her and say how she's not that bad, and what's the big tragedy, she gets all pissed off at me--I'm not giving her credit for her feelings or something. It's like she basically wanted to have a fight or something.", "input": "", "output": "So you broke off the relationship because of this?"}, {"instruction": "No, that just started off the evening. I can't believe it. For days, I'd been thinking of her constantly, wondering if she would call. Then when she finally did, I was so excited I could hardly talk, so naturally my hand starts to throb. And when we finally got together, it was like our moons just went into Saturn or something. First of all, I'm suddenly in all this pain--the hand was giving me problems just thinking about her, but when the doorbell rang it was like a spike was run into it. And there she is, looking terrible, like a refugee or something--I know I shouldn't be talking, but I always thought of her as healthy and beautiful, you know? And then we sit there and start talking--it should have been so easy, but I don't know what happened. I felt like she was blaming me for something. I don't know if it was something I did, or maybe didn't do but should have, but in spite of wanting to cover her with kisses, I had to perform this deadly Punch and Judy show with her, and watch it from outside. And we start arguing about the stuff that happened the last time she came over--remember I told you how she trashed the plants? Well she had a whole different version of how it went, but I could hear myself stupidly insisting on my own. It was like I was trapped inside a robot, and had to watch it act like a total jerk. But that was my body, even though I couldn't get through to it. I was feeling weird that day and I guess I really don't know what the heck happened. I just hope it didn't go the way I think I remember it.", "input": "", "output": "How was that?"}, {"instruction": "It's like she was increasingly desperate as the evening went on. We started talking about this and that at random, but it was like nothing clicked. She kept looking at me, like she was wondering if this was the same guy she knew. Then she tries to kiss him.", "input": "", "output": "Him?"}, {"instruction": "Sorry--the robot, me. She puts her lips on that stony face, and nothing happens, it's like there was an inch of rubber between us. And I can't see how she could have done it, but she put her hand on his...you know.", "input": "", "output": "Your penis?"}, {"instruction": "And squeezed. It was so unexpected. So whorish. This is too much for the robot.  He jumps up wearing a frozen mask of shock and horror. Awful words start coming out of his mouth. She gives a sort of shriek, grabs her stuff, and runs out the door. And all the while I'm rattling around inside this monster, yelling: \"How can you be such a brute? She's in tears. Follow her and make sure she's okay!\" But the robot just stands there and listens to her footfalls dying away.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you often feel as disassociated from your body as that?"}, {"instruction": "It seems like I have lately, but I'm just lying around, not doing anything, so it's hard to tell. Maybe it's the pain flaring up that makes my body seem like such an uninviting place to hang out. It seems better if I just lie there with my arm up and don't try to do anything.", "input": "", "output": "You can get medication for pain. If you want, I'll prescribe some. Your regular doctor should be the one in charge of this, though. Are you seeing him regularly?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of. There's not a lot they can do, except give you pills and more pills. And now you're trying to give me more--what happened to \"Just Say No?\"", "input": "", "output": "It's your call, Peter. I think it's possible you might be suffering some kind of drug side-effect, so from that point of view it would be good to limit further medication until we track it down. On the other hand, it's hard to enjoy life if you're in pain. I'd be glad to talk to your neurologist about substituting anticonvulsants. I don't think the antibiotics are a problem. But I'll check the literature for combination effects just to be sure, okay? I'm sure we can find something that works for you."}, {"instruction": "I'd like to believe you're right about that, I really would. But I'm afraid this goes much deeper, and there's not much hope for me; I'm just one of Nature's failed experiments.", "input": "", "output": "Come on, that sort of thing is not going to get you anywhere, is it? You've got a lot going for you, just give yourself a chance. We'll be able to talk some more about it next week."}, {"instruction": "Oh, time to go?", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid so."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, then.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Peter."}, {"instruction": "Hi Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Peter. How've your last couple of weeks been?"}, {"instruction": "Pretty uneventful. I've mostly been staying home alone.", "input": "", "output": "Trying to find another job?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I guess I'm too depressed for that. If you go to an interview, you have to seem sort of eager--bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, you know? The way I feel now, I'd just be wasting everybody's time.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Should we be considering any medication--perhaps an antidepressant?  It might help snap you out of your slump."}, {"instruction": "Nah, I think I'll stick to my natural low. Call it hibernation. I think it's just something I've got to go through. Anyway, unemployment should be kicking in pretty soon. It'll be like a vacation for me--I can use it, too.", "input": "", "output": "You're sure? Sitting around feeling badly doesn't sound like a lot of fun. Maybe I'm missing something?"}, {"instruction": "It's not all doom and gloom. I've had time to do a lot of things I'd been putting off.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, alphabetizing my books, putting my magazines into chronological order. I've had more time for reading, and that's been real good. I've found out a lot more about Babylon. It's pretty clear they were the first people to get into regular contact with extra-terrestrials--it's all there, if you know how to read it.", "input": "", "output": "And you do?"}, {"instruction": "Didn't I tell you I spent a lifetime there?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, right. So that's mostly what you've been doing--reading?"}, {"instruction": "Well, there's a lot of important stuff on the Internet too. I never had a chance to spend a lot of time online before, but it's pretty amazing what's out there. Do you surf the web?", "input": "", "output": "Occasionally, but I haven't had the time to get fully immersed. Why, what have you found?"}, {"instruction": "It's like we each had a piece of the puzzle, but nowhere to put it. But now, as we get in touch with one another, we can put together our little bits of knowledge and get a glimpse of the big picture. It's almost scary. In a way, we're all coalescing into one giant organism, eternally feeding on itself...", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like science fiction. But I'd really like to stick to what's going on with you personally. What do you do with your typical day, now that you aren't going to work?"}, {"instruction": "You really want to know? It's very boring. I never go out or anything. In a way, the Internet is a substitute for all that.", "input": "", "output": "You mean, a social life?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. After I've been to the chat rooms, it's just like I was in a bar, except I didn't have to buy any drinks. I've got lots of friends online, mostly people I've met on Usenet. And thanks to the porno sites, a lonely guy doesn't have to leave his room in order to have a sexual encounter.", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think you should get out more? Maybe meet some people in the flesh?"}, {"instruction": "If I can connect with someone on a purely spiritual level, even if it's through a machine, what else do I need?", "input": "", "output": "Is that what's happening at those porno sites, pure spiritual communication?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, touch\u00e9, Doctor, touch\u00e9. You think I haven't wrestled with that particular contradiction? But I admit you've got a point--about getting out more, anyway. Actually, my computer keeps crashing--I figure it's an omen. Somebody or something's trying to tell me I'm using it too much.", "input": "", "output": "So aside from reading, surfing the web, masturbating, and arranging your stuff, what have you been doing with yourself? That can't be the sum total of your existence."}, {"instruction": "Well, there's eating and sleeping, but I suppose I haven't been doing much of either--and no, I don't want something to help me sleep. My dreams are still the best part of my day.", "input": "", "output": "Are they always different, or do they recur?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes they're different, but there's one I keep having. It's like I'm an animal waking up half-buried in the earth. I can smell the leaves rotting and see things crawling around in the dim light filtering down through the huge old trees overhead. I feel cold and restless; I want to find a sunnier spot. I try to push the dirt away and dig my way out, but my front paw is stuck--it's caught in a trap and there's no way I can get it off. I struggle with it for hours, twisting and writhing, but it's no use--I know what I have to do. So slowly, methodically, I start chewing my arm off, working through the layers of muscle, grinding at the tendons, then I hear the bone start crunching as my busy little teeth work away. In a way it feels horrible, and in a way it's good--it's the taste of liberation. But that's where I wake up. I never actually get free. And the next night I have to start all over again. Maybe I should join the animal rights movement--that must be what this is about. There're lots of places where they still trap animals like that, and it's got to be stopped. I can see that now.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't feel trapped yourself? Don't you think that might be part of it?"}, {"instruction": "Me? No, I've never been more free. No job, no responsibilities...maybe the dream is an attempt to compensate--sort of a guilt trip I'm laying on myself.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe. Do you happen to recall which arm you were chewing in your dream?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, my right.", "input": "", "output": "The one that was bitten. Has that healed up yet?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of. Most of the time I hardly notice it. But sometimes it starts hurting like hell. Why? Do you think that's what triggers those dreams?", "input": "", "output": "It could have something to do with it. Are you still taking antibiotics?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, they're very insistent that I finish the whole course of medication. Apparently it's really bad if you start it and then stop before it's had a chance to work.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I'm glad you're sticking with it. You know, I looked up all the drug interactions associated with phenytoin--that's what you're taking to prevent seizures--and I couldn't find any problems caused by taking it with antibiotics. Are you sure that's the only medication you're using?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm really not into drugs--I have to force myself to take all these pills. I can't think of anything else except aspirin, which I sometimes take for those killer headaches I told you about.", "input": "", "output": "Aspirin, huh? That might be it. I forget exactly what it said, but I seem to remember that salicylates were contra-indicated. Maybe you should try acetaminophen instead next time."}, {"instruction": "What's that? I thought aspirin was supposed to be good for everything.", "input": "", "output": "Sorry--I didn't mean to get technical on you. Aspirin is usually benign but it could be interacting with the other drugs.  And acetaminophen is just a generic name for Tylenol, that's all."}, {"instruction": "Oh, okay. I guess I can do that. You really think that's what made me act so weird with Eliza that time?", "input": "", "output": "It's just a possibility, but it would be nice to rule it out. Have you two gotten together since then?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, sort of. Actually, I tried to call her the next day, but her mom answered, real unfriendly. I don't know what Eliza told her about me, but it couldn't have been good. After a few more days, I tried again--same thing. Finally, after about a week of this, Eliza called me up. She's got a new place of her own, and I went there, but nothing much happened.", "input": "", "output": "Nothing good, or nothing bad?"}, {"instruction": "Neither, really. We took it real slow--I guess we were both scared by what happened. She'd worked herself up into a real state about it, and I guess not hearing from me--not that it was my fault--didn't help. I don't know what's going on between her and her folks. I guess they threw her out, right when she was needing some love and support--nice, huh? So she was a real mess, and you know where I'm at; you don't start much of a fire by rubbing two wet blankets together...", "input": "", "output": "You mean you tried to have sex and failed?"}, {"instruction": "No, nothing like that. I guess there's a lot of trust we need to build back up before we get to that point. We mostly sat in front of the TV and held hands, said we were sorry--a lot of crying and head-stroking, that sort of thing.", "input": "", "output": "You were both crying?"}, {"instruction": "No, I guess I'm not that in touch with my feelings--too German or something. She was doing the crying, I was doing the \"there, there, it's okay\" stuff. It felt good, being needed like that, even though I was kind of useless, and her feeling so bad was mostly my fault in the first place. But it seemed to help. I guess we're back to square one. It's not like I thought--that I'd totally blown it for good. So I'm going to see her again in a couple of days. I hope I don't go into another weird state like before.", "input": "", "output": "You mean your \"robot\" condition?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It was so strange; I'm not usually that way--I don't think so, anyway. You really think it was the aspirin?", "input": "", "output": "It's just a possibility. Have you got any other ideas?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want to say, because saying something out loud makes it more real. And you're just going to scoff at me anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Try me."}, {"instruction": "I think I've been cursed. That wasn't just a bite I got, it sealed an entity into my blood. It's taken over my hand, and it's trying to take the rest of me. It's going slowly, except when it feels threatened like the other night. Then it goes into high gear, and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm just a zombie who has to do what it wants. You know how, when a vampire bites someone, they have to become a vampire too? You think that's just a myth? Maybe it's something that really happens. Do you think I'm going to do Eliza harm? I couldn't stand that. I couldn't let it happen. If it comes to it, would you be willing to drive a stake through my heart?", "input": "", "output": "Whoa, Peter, slow down. Don't you think there are some other explanations for what went on? I mean, you were pretty depressed, taking medication..."}, {"instruction": "I knew you'd start in with your rational explanations--you think I haven't gone through them a million times? But this is what happens to spiritual seekers who betray their gurus: they get cursed.", "input": "", "output": "Look, I'd like to get into all this with you, but you sprung it at the very end of the session. Let's start right at this point next week, okay? And in the meantime, take Tylenol, not aspirin."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, take two pills and see me next week. I might have known.", "input": "", "output": "Come on, Peter. I think that you know that I really care about what you're feeling, whether it's based in reality or not. But I've got another patient waiting..."}, {"instruction": "Okay, fine, I'm out of here.", "input": "", "output": "Peter!"}, {"instruction": "Not great. And I really don't know how you can help. It's just a shot in the dark, coming here at all, but I don't know what else I can do.", "input": "", "output": "What's the matter? Can you talk about it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I tried, the last time I saw you, remember?", "input": "", "output": "You mean when you told me you thought you were under some kind of a curse?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I left before you could give me one of your patented rational explanations. So what are you going to tell me, it's a drug interaction, an after-effect of epilepsy, or just something my poor deluded brain cooked up to keep itself amused? I was left sort of wondering which it was going to be.", "input": "", "output": "Before we start trying to explain it, do you think you could backtrack a little and tell me what's been going on?"}, {"instruction": "Remember I was telling you I'd been invaded by some kind of an entity who could take control of my body, even my thoughts? It hasn't gone away. It comes on as the moon gets full, then sort of fades out until I'm feeling almost normal--like now--then it starts getting worse again. Maybe it jumped aboard when I was tripping so blissfully between dimensions--like some ghastly parasite you pick up on your travels.", "input": "", "output": "I thought you were associating it with a curse, and that infected bite . But your hand looks a lot better; it seems to have healed up just fine."}, {"instruction": "I should have cut it off then, before the curse took hold. Now it's sealed into my flesh, and it just keeps getting stronger. Maybe this is something that thrives on cursed souls, hollowing them out from within. Soon I'll be the vehicle it drives around our world, and everybody else will have to hear the horrors it's been whispering in my ear. Don't let that happen, Doctor. Please kill me first.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been hearing voices whispering to you?"}, {"instruction": "Just one voice. And what it says is so horrible, I can't take much more.", "input": "", "output": "Horrible like how?"}, {"instruction": "Like I'm walking down the street, and I pass a mother walking with a two-year old kid. And the whispering starts--\"Do it, do it now!\" and I get an image--it's me, tearing the child's throat out with my teeth, while the mother looks on in total shock. Then it fades, and I haven't really done anything, but the mom is giving me a funny look, and pulling her kid a little closer.", "input": "", "output": "But you haven't actually done anything violent?"}, {"instruction": "Not really--not yet. But what's going on? I was never like this--I couldn't even watch violent movies; they still make me sick. Am I turning into some kind of monster? Is there anything I can do about it? I can't take much more of this. I'm afraid to go out anymore, I'm afraid of what it might make me do. I can't eat, I can't sleep. It's wearing me down, I can feel it.", "input": "", "output": "Calm down, Peter. I know you feel upset about having these unwelcome thoughts and impulses, but there's a lot of things we can do. Remember, you've had a lot of time to brood over this fixed idea of yours, and blow it up out of all proportion. Curses really only work on people who believe in them, and you seem to have a lot of faith in this one. I know you feel guilty about your break-up with Serena, but can't you just accept what happened and go on with your life? There's no need to punish yourself like this. Coming in to talk about it is a good first step, though."}, {"instruction": "So you're saying this is all in my head? God, I wish I could believe you. Can you give me a transfusion of rationality, a drug to send these evil thoughts and images away? I'll take it--I'd try anything at this point.", "input": "", "output": "I wish it was as simple as that. There might be some drugs that could help, and daily therapy could do you a lot of good. If you feel you really are on the point of doing something terrible--and that sounds like what you're saying--a hospital stay might be something to consider. Does that sound like something you'd be willing to try?"}, {"instruction": "It sounds sort of restful--but do you think once they got me in there that they'd ever let me go again? I'm really a mess--I haven't told you half of it.", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead and tell me the rest then."}, {"instruction": "Remember I told you about Eliza and me, that time she touched me and the thing inside me started raging at her, driving her off in tears?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I remember. But I thought you'd made up after that."}, {"instruction": "We did, sort of. But I was pretty nervous after what happened, and I didn't want to stir anything up. So I didn't call her for a couple of weeks, hoping I'd get myself more together, be able to help with her problems instead of just loading her with mine. But all that time the moon kept getting bigger and bigger, and the control I thought I had seemed to be slipping away. I started getting these images of her--not like I know she really is, but like some kind of prostitute, leering and slutty. Like she'd be spread out like one of those porno shots, playing with herself, and teasing me, daring me to act like a man and give her what she wanted. And this whispering voice kept nagging at me, saying \"You can have her, just take her, she's begging for it. \"", "input": "", "output": "You did say you've been looking at a lot of pornography lately. Don't you think a little crossover into the rest of your thoughts should be expected?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe. But I was never like that, even in high school when all the other boys were sex-crazed. I always thought of the girls as people pretty much like me, I never turned them into sex-objects; maybe that's why they liked me. And Eliza is the last person I'd ever think of that way. So finally I did call her up--it was pathetic how glad she sounded when I talked to her. I guess she'd been missing me--she really didn't know when she was well-off. The moon was half-full when she came over, shining into the room where we sat on the couch trying to make small-talk, and I could feel my control slipping away, as if my aura was suddenly being eclipsed by a stronger one. I had to struggle to keep my voice sounding normal, my hands from trembling. It was a cool night but I was sweating real bad, this terrible-smelling stuff seemed to be pouring out of me. And then I couldn't help it, I grabbed her. At first she seemed to relax into my grip, but then...she saw something in my eyes, I guess, and knew it wasn't me that had her. She couldn't believe it, kept saying \"Peter, let go, you're hurting me--stop it, you're scaring me--what's the matter?\" It was the hardest thing I ever did, getting him to let her go, but at last she struggled free. I managed to keep him bottled up while she sort of hovered around, asking was I okay, was I having a seizure or something. All I could manage was a choked-off scream: \"Get out. Get out of here now before it kills you!\" I guess she believed me then; she ran off into the night.", "input": "", "output": "Was that the last time you saw her?"}, {"instruction": "I wish. After that, the images got worse, lots worse. I'd see her in all these provocative poses, then I'd grab at her and she'd come apart, like she'd been dismembered. Then she'd come to me as just a head, or missing her arms, or with pieces carved out. And all the while this awful whispering kept on in my head: \"Give that whore what she deserves. Slice up that little slut. Show her what happens to cock-teasers.\" She called me up a few times, wondering if I was okay, actually hinting she'd like to see me again--I could hardly believe it. Ultimately, I had to tell her to just leave me alone, that I couldn't see her any more. It really hurt to say that, but I had to. Who knows what might have happened? And so far, it's worked, she's left me alone for the last couple of weeks. I really miss her. For a while there, I thought she was the one person who could save me. But I love her too much to let her come near me right now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you really think you're capable of harming her?"}, {"instruction": "It depends on what you mean by me. I never wanted to hurt anyone, her least of all. I still love her, maybe more now than ever. But I've been invaded by a thing that detests me so much that whatever I love, it automatically hates. And I think it would destroy her just to demonstrate its power over me, and crush my feeble attempts at rebellion once and for all. That would be the very worst thing it could do, and it realizes that. That's why I can't sleep at night. I know it's waiting for its opportunity. In the old days, they would have known what to do with somebody like me: a silver bullet, a stake through the heart, dismemberment and burial at some lonely crossroads. What's the approved modern therapy for demonic possession?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think we usually call it by that name these days, but there are some things we can do. If you're willing, I could check on the availability of hospital beds. It sounds like you need rest and some fairly intensive therapy--more than you've been getting so far. We probably should have done this sooner, but I was hoping you'd pull out of it on your own. Did you ever get a new job, or have you been spending all your time alone in your apartment?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't been alone, I've got lots of friends all over the net. Really, I've been socializing a lot more than I ever did before. It's easier finding people who share your interests when you've got the whole world to choose from.", "input": "", "output": "I was just thinking that if you aren't employed you would have more time to deal with these issues, without being afraid of losing your job."}, {"instruction": "No, I don't have to worry about that anymore. Did I tell you I'm suing SII for violating my rights as a disabled person? I called in to a radio call-in show on illegal termination, and the lawyer that was talking agreed to take my case on spec. She says the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits exactly what they did to me and that a big company like that ought to have known better. She's real confident about it.", "input": "", "output": "Well good for you--at least you're fighting back. That's a good sign. Uh, we're out of time here, but I'd like you to stay in my outer office while I make some calls.  I know of a really nice place where I think we can get you in, maybe even tonight."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll hang out.", "input": "", "output": "Great. I'll talk to you soon. Just make yourself comfortable, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, see you later.", "input": "", "output": "See you, Peter.  Let me just make these arrangements and I can go over there with you.  Just read a magazine or something, and I'll be right with you."}]
