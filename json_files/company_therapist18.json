The teachers taught us to make the sign for \"toilet\" when we had to go to the bathroom. Once, I had to go really bad and I kept signing \"toilet\" to my mother. She ignored me on purpose--she wanted me to speak. I couldn't hold it in any more, and I wet myself. My mother was really angry. She spanked me and sent me to my room.

In some of these schools, teachers tied down the hands of deaf children so they couldn't sign. When I went to Gallaudet, I felt really out of place. All the other students signed beautifully.

I got good grades, I studied a lot, but I wasn't on level academically with kids my age. My grade-point-average and SAT scores were good enough to get me into Gallaudet, but I wasn't really prepared for college. I had to take a lot of remedial classes and improve my ASL.", "input": "", "output": "Were you able to meet people and make friends at school?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, a little bit, but not as much as I would had liked. I always felt like a geek because of my poor signing. For some reason, I am more comfortable around hearing people. I feel like they are more accepting. Maybe it's just envy, because I really wanted to be like them. I worked really hard to get my speech to be understandable. I would practice long hours with my teachers. My parents even hired a speech therapist. We would say the same sentences over and over again. It was frustrating--I used to break down crying.

He couldn't finish anything--not college, not even the vocational school my mother sent him to so he could get a decent-paying job. He got married to a girl from his church.

One Thanksgiving, when my father's family was visiting from England, I told them about the awards I won and my Honor Society membership. My mom pulled me into the kitchen and told me I was getting a big head and I was making Mark feel bad because he didn't graduate from college.

They wanted to determine whether the child was deaf while it was still in utero. When the doctor told them the baby had normal hearing, the couple wanted an abortion--they wanted a deaf child. Many people, including deaf people, find that story shocking. I do too. I don't agree with that couple, but I understand their feelings. For some, being deaf is an identity, and those individuals have a strong sense of pride about it. Deaf people want to marry other deaf people, just as some people want to marry within their own racial group or in their own faith. And many deaf people want deaf children who will share their culture and language.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I understand why some deaf persons resent the hearing world--they feel it has rejected them. To a lot of deaf people, \"hearing\" and \"stupid\" are almost synonymous. They forget that there are stupid, ignorant, deaf people, too--like my roommates.

In the deaf world, being able to sign well is very important. Some people are gifted that way, they have a talent for telling stories and communicating through sign.

They also criticized Marlee Matlin because she didn't sign her acceptance speech at the Oscars, she spoke instead.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "I've also heard deaf activists either praise or criticize Louise Fletcher for signing at the Academy Awards. Some of them say what she did was good for deaf people, others say it was demeaning because she is a hearing person. You can't win.

A lot of deaf people love to dance. Hearing people are often surprised that deaf people are good at it.

That seemed the cruelest thing of all--forcing a deaf child to take ballet. Ballet music doesn't have a strong beat like popular dance music.

In addition to having affairs, sexual addiction may include the use of pornography, masturbation, sexual fantasies, and placing inordinate sexual demands on a partner. Some people use sex as a means of escape, the same way an addict uses drugs. Studies have linked a deficit in the neurochemistry of the limbic system in people thought to have a sex addiction. These patients have sex to restore the Dopamine levels in their brains."}, {"instruction": "I read an article about Clinton which labeled him a sex addict. That would explain a lot of things. Why else would such a smart, ambitious man ruin his life and embarrass his family by doing what he did?", "input": "", "output": "Sex addicts often describe their needs as overwhelming. They feel out of control. While normal people want sex, sex addicts need it and will go to extraordinary length to get it."}, {"instruction": "I don't think I'm like that, at least not yet.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you are sex addict, Kelly.

I was bad.", "input": "", "output": "Kelly, I'm glad you approached me with this topic. I sense it was somewhat difficult for you to bring up. Exploring one's sexuality and need for intimacy are common concerns.

I'm concerned that in your quest to fulfill your emotional needs, you might find yourself falling into that trap."}, {"instruction": "I see what you're saying.

People kept making jokes about it.", "input": "", "output": "Peter was threatened by your sexual curiosity. Some men are intimidated by women who have a greater interest in sex than they do. I'm sure you realize that you're not the only person--and certainly not the only woman--to express an interest in anal sex. Have you read any of the research by Kinsey or Masters and Johnson? I think new editions of their books are available. I don't remember the exact numbers, but about half of the heterosexual population has tried anal intercourse at least once. From a biological standpoint, the anus has a large concentration of nerve endings and is very sensitive to stimulation. Because it is close to the genitals and contracts during orgasm, for some people, it is an erogenous area. From a psychological standpoint, anal sex is a social taboo activity that some people find exciting due to its forbidden nature."}, {"instruction": "I feel better now that you've said that. It's not the type of thing women are supposed to think about.", "input": "", "output": "You're free to think about anything you like, Kelly. Acting out some of your fantasies is a different matter.

She must have known I was interested in him.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell her?"}, {"instruction": "Not in so many words, but I've been spending more time at the Help Desk. I thought I'd feel him out, see if there was any interest there. I wasn't flirting really, I was just being a little extra friendly. I didn't get the sense that he was attracted to me. At lunch, he barely said anything. I could tell he was uncomfortable, and he kept giving me these funny looks. I hope he doesn't think I put Rachel up to this.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Once, when I was talking to him, I touched him lightly on the arm, and he stared at my hand as if I was a leper.

Why should I care so much about what he thinks? If all he wants is a pretty girlfriend, he's not for me.", "input": "", "output": "You have a point, Kelly.

I'm invincible.", "input": "", "output": "I understand your frustration, Kelly, but don't be so quick to dismiss Tom or anyone else you have an interest in who doesn't respond to you right away. In dating situations, men are often expected to initiate contact. This societal expectation brings with it a great deal of pressure and stress. It takes time to build up the courage to ask a woman out, or even just to talk to her."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Maybe what he wants is a woman with normal hearing. I hadn't even thought of that until now. Looks like I'm the one that's a putz, not Tom.", "input": "", "output": "You don't know and you're just speculating, Kelly.

I can't stand the thought of another blind date.", "input": "", "output": "You sound like a weary veteran."}, {"instruction": "Hmm, a veteran, uh? Yeah, dating is a lot like combat.

You don't necessarily have to join a group with the goal of finding a date. You can take a class or join a club centered around an activity that interests you.

It offended me that Sacks quoted one of his colleagues, who described deafness as a curable form of mental retardation. He made this statement several times! There is ample evidence to refute the assumption that deaf people are stupid. Educators like Laurent Clerc discovered that deaf people were intelligent and capable of learning over a hundred years ago.", "input": "", "output": "I understand why you might take umbrage at such assumptions. Sacks was viewing the deaf community as an outsider. As a cultural anthropologist, he needs to remain objective and to take into account societal prejudices.

Before deaf education evolved into what it is today, many deaf children were denied any sort of education at all. Their linguistic abilities and mental capacity was not even given an opportunity to develop. People just assumed they couldn't learn. As the result, many deaf children were, in effect, developmentally disabled. The same thing happens to children with normal hearing who suffer severe abuse and neglect."}, {"instruction": "I know that, Doctor. That's the fault of ignorant hearing people, not the fault of a deaf child. It's the tone of the book that angered me the most. Hacky-Sacks constantly expressed surprise that deaf people are not stupid. What does he know? He observed the deaf like they were lab rats for a few years, and now he thinks he's an expert. There are people who've devoted their entire lives to studying deaf culture and linguistics and who are much more qualified than he is to write about the deaf community. I saw him on a PBS special a few nights ago. When he conversed with deaf people, he didn't even attempt to sign. I've lived with deafness all my life, along with four to five million Americans. We know more about deafness and deaf culture than any cunning linguist. We can write our own history, thank you very much. I didn't think that book was very well written either. Why does nearly every goddamn page have to have two inches of footnotes? It's distracting when footnotes take up more than half the page. Most of the footnotes could have been incorporated into the text. A lot of that book is redundant and unnecessary.

How do you think blacks and Hispanics feel when they read a book like \"The Bell Curve\" which claims that statistical data proves they are intellectually inferior?

It comes naturally from having to adapt to a world of stupid hearing people. Where did the belief that deaf people are stupid come from?

Up until a few years ago, I thought that if I did well in school and got a good job, they would come to accept me. But I finally realized that I was banging my head against a wall. As far as my mother is concerned, nothing I do will ever be good enough. My father is too wrapped up in his work to care. I still get jealous of the parents of other deaf people.

I was so surprised, I just stared at her. Angie smiled at me and came into my bedroom. She sat on the edge of the bed and began kissing and touching me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How did this make you feel, Kelly?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if it was the wine, but I just...well, I froze. I let her do it.", "input": "", "output": "Was this something you wanted?"}, {"instruction": "It's not like she forced me, but she didn't ask me, either.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have any indication that Angie was attracted to you?"}, {"instruction": "Not that way. She's always friendly, and she'd hug me and rub my back, but it was never sexual. Even when we went to buy the vibrator, I didn't think that she was like that.", "input": "", "output": "You mean a lesbian?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if she's a lesbian. She seemed to know what to do, it felt like she had a lot of experience. She really knew my body, all my sensitive places: behind my knees, my stomach, even my feet.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How did you respond?"}, {"instruction": "At first, I lay there, not knowing what to do. She held me and kissed me for a long time while she undressed me and ran her hands up and down over me. I found myself kissing her back, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. She did things with her tongue that were...well, they were very different. I had no idea kissing could be so erotic. When she started working her way down, kissing my breasts and stomach, I started to get nervous. Angie picked up on it right away, like she knew what I was thinking.", "input": "", "output": "Did you want her to stop at that point?"}, {"instruction": "She knew to slow down. She made the \"I love you\" sign and lay next to me with her arms around me. That's when I put her hand on me. What she did was so different. Her whole approach...it was very emotional for me.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Usually, sex is fast and passionate. With Peter, we couldn't wait to get our clothes off and start banging away. No one ever took the time to really look at me and get to know my body like Angie did. When she spread my legs apart, she sat up and opened me up with her fingers and looked at me. She really looked at me, and then she smiled. It was weird having her look into my eyes and then at my vagina that way. It was so personal, opened up like that was the most vulnerable way to be. At that moment, I felt this rush of warmth. I felt loved and accepted.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "She used her hand, and then her mouth. When I felt her tongue down there, it was very intense, direct pressure, but different from the vibrator. My entire body was tingling. I've had men go down on me, but I didn't like it. It didn't feel good, not like that.", "input": "", "output": "Did you practice safe sex?"}, {"instruction": "What? Oh, I didn't even think of that. But I always use condoms with men.", "input": "", "output": "It's a good idea to use a barrier protection during oral sex as well. Good Vibrations carries those, as well as dental dams and latex gloves."}, {"instruction": "I didn't know you had to worry about that with women.", "input": "", "output": "Oral sex isn't as high risk as some of the other activities, but it's a good idea to take precautions, especially with a new partner."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I should talk to Angie about that.", "input": "", "output": "Is this something you would like to do again?"}, {"instruction": "A part of me wants to. I can't stop thinking about it. But I'm not sure if Angie wants to, though. I haven't seen much of her since then.", "input": "", "output": "Do you regret what you did?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I don't know what I feel. I think I would calm down if I could see her again. I really want to see her, but I don't know where the hell she's been. She works long hours, and she has a lot of friends. It's not unusual not to see her for a few days.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I keep replaying what happened in my mind over and over again, and I'm always in a semi-aroused state. I wonder if this is what animals in heat feel like.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "What's funny is that I haven't been able to get myself off since then. I use the vibrator on the highest setting until I feel raw and sore, and I still can't come.", "input": "", "output": "Is it usually difficult for you to reach an orgasm?"}, {"instruction": "No, not by myself. I didn't come with Angie, though she went down on me for a long time. I was like I was too excited and couldn't build up enough tension to come. She eventually stopped. She said her tongue was getting tired. Angie kissed me after that, and I could taste myself on her. At first, I didn't want to kiss her right after she had done that, but I didn't want to be rude, so I did. I was surprised that I liked the taste and the way it felt. I didn't go down on her, though.", "input": "", "output": "Did you want to?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't know what to do. I felt clumsy. I asked her what I could do in return. Angie lay back and guided my hands over her breasts and the rest of her. It was interesting, touching a woman that way. It was a strange sensation, like exploring the landscape of another planet. Angie's always on a diet, but I like her body the way it is. It's womanly and beautiful. She's very soft and feminine. I should have told her that. She's so insecure about her looks and weight. I liked it when she held me, she smelled good, and her skin was soft.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Angie told me to use the vibrator on myself, but I couldn't come. She used it on herself, and I played with her breasts. I think she wanted me to suck on them, but I couldn't bring myself to do that. I loved watching her as she came. I could feel myself getting excited, the closer she got. It was as if I could feel everything she was feeling, but not directly, only in my head, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand. But I'm worried about the safe sex issue. Practicing safe sex also means not sharing sex toys. Ideally, you should each have your own. But you can clean what you've been using with soap and hot water before letting someone else play with it."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I didn't know you could catch a disease that way.", "input": "", "output": "It's not the most common means of transmitting STDs, but it's definitely a possibility. I don't want you to take unnecessary risks, Kelly."}, {"instruction": "Come to think of it, I saw a bottle of dildo shampoo, or something like that, at Good Vibes.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not an expert on sex toys..."}, {"instruction": "You can borrow mine anytime.", "input": "", "output": "Very funny. As I was saying, I think antibacterial soap and hot water are effective cleansing agents, unless the manufacturer specifies something else. Rubbing alcohol may also be used."}, {"instruction": "I always learn something new when I come here. I don't think I should submerge the vibrator, though, especially if it's plugged in.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure the staff at Good Vibrations can provide you with guidance on this matter."}, {"instruction": "They're all dykes. I don't have anything against them, but the militant lesbians--the ones who have a very masculine look--are kind of scary. It never occurred to me that I could be a lesbian. I always thought of myself as a heterosexual. I used to only look at men. I mean I really love men...or I used to, no matter how much they pissed me off. Now I barely notice them. I find myself looking at women all the time. When I walk down Market street, I can watch the women for hours. Women are really beautiful, at least physically. Men seem ugly and crude by comparison. I better not ogle too many women at work, I don't want them to think I am a pervert or gain a reputation...", "input": "", "output": "One sexual experience with a woman doesn't make you a lesbian, Kelly. Many people experiment sexually with members of their own gender."}, {"instruction": "I don't feel like a lesbian, but I'm not feeling very heterosexual these days, either. Does this make me bisexual?", "input": "", "output": "You don't have to decide right away. Your sexual identity is your own creation, it may change and shift. Think of sexuality as water that takes the shape of the container it's in. Your sexual feelings will evolve as you change and grow."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Kelly, you said you didn't know what you wanted when Angie first approached you. Was there a part of you that wanted her to stop?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I don't think so.", "input": "", "output": "You described negative sexual encounters with your first boyfriend. Have you often felt pressured into doing things you didn't want to do?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't like that, it wasn't the way it was with Daryl.", "input": "", "output": "When women are programmed to be passive in bed from an early age, they often find it difficult to articulate their needs. This can be quite damaging to their sexual health and self-esteem. If you were put off by Angie's advances, could you have refused them?"}, {"instruction": "I wasn't put off by what she did. I was surprised at first, shocked even. But it was an incredible experience.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you enjoyed it. I'm glad it was a positive experience. But you didn't answer my question, Kelly."}, {"instruction": "I didn't? Oh yeah, my brain's turned into Spam. What's the question again?", "input": "", "output": "If you didn't like what Angie was doing, could you have told her to stop? Or would you have been afraid of hurting her feelings or of making her angry?"}, {"instruction": "Are you implying that I can't say no?", "input": "", "output": "No, Kelly, that's..."}, {"instruction": "I can say no! I don't fuck everything that moves! What do you think I am? A whore?", "input": "", "output": "Kelly, calm down. That's not what I meant. I'm concerned that your early sexual experiences were damaging--you described being pressured into sex, being ridiculed for your interest in it, and being betrayed by your partner. Those are all quite traumatic experiences, especially at a young age when your sexuality is just emerging. Ideally, sex is an expression of love, desire, and affection. Having sex involves a great deal of trust..."}, {"instruction": "I've had sex, but I haven't really made love, except maybe to Angie. It has to go both ways to be considered making love. It doesn't count if the other person is only fucking you.", "input": "", "output": "I see. I think you should talk to Angie about your experience. Find out how she felt. And you also need to discuss the safe sex issues with her."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I should track her down on campus tonight.

Jesus, it's really killing me!", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to lie down?"}, {"instruction": "No, that's okay. I don't want to fall asleep.", "input": "", "output": "You might consider getting a new pillow--some people who have neck pain find it helpful to change the kind of pillow they sleep on.

I hadn't thought of that either.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been taking anything for the pain?"}, {"instruction": "I've tried just about every pain reliever you can buy. They all work at first, but I end up taking six or ten pills a day, and my stomach starts to hurt.", "input": "", "output": "You must be careful with dosage when taking pain medication.

They have to wait on hold forever. I can't tie up the relay service like that, they have other people to take care of, too.

Now I just don't care. I feel like I don't care about anything. All I can think about is my work. I even dream about work. I'm turning into my father.

I thought he was mad at something, but maybe that's just the way his face is because once I started talking to him, he was very personable. He had a thick accent--some sort of European accent. I had a hard time understanding him. He was nice, though. He wrote down some things that I didn't understand, but he didn't make a big deal of my deafness. And he had a nice touch. His hands were warm. Why is it that most doctors always have cold hands? Well, at least the ones I see.", "input": "", "output": "So your spine adjustment went well?"}, {"instruction": "It startled me, especially the part where he did my neck, but I felt much better afterward.

How was your week otherwise?"}, {"instruction": "It was okay. The usual, you know, working a lot. Last Friday, I actually left the office at five o'clock so I could go out and do something.

The performer was very good. I had heard about her before, and that was why I wanted to come.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "While she was performing, my stupid roommates were making fun of this guy.

How did you respond?"}, {"instruction": "I gave them a couple of dirty looks, but those two monkeys couldn't take a hint. The boy had a broad face, his eyes were widely-spaced, and his eyebrows grew together. He had one blue eye and one brown eye. The blue eye was a very bright blue.

Later, Angie told me he had Waardenburg's Syndrome.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. That's quite a rare genetic disorder.

Only a very small percentage of the deaf population has Waardenburg's."}, {"instruction": "Yes, that's what Angie said.

I usually don't have a problem going up to someone, but I felt funny about saying hello to him.", "input": "", "output": "Because of his appearance?"}, {"instruction": "No, that wasn't it. He looked different, but it was actually quite attractive. I didn't want to seem like I was feeling sorry for him. Most disabled people are sensitive to that.

She said his family was new to the area.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "For some reason, I've been thinking about him a lot.
