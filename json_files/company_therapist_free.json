[{"instruction": "Hey. You Doc Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Yes I am. You must be Mr. Freeman. Please come in."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doc. You mind if I call you that? Some doctors get all put out when you shorten it.", "input": "", "output": "Doc is fine. I gather you've been to other doctors?"}, {"instruction": "You're quick, Doc. I'll have to remember that. Yeah, I've been to a few in recent years. Never seem to hang on for very long though. Usually get cold feet when we finally get to the real crux of it.", "input": "", "output": "Who gets cold feet? You or the doctors?"}, {"instruction": "Oh hell, Doc. They do. I'm as normal as they come, but when we get to the meat of it, when the rubber hits the road, they seem to lose interest and bail on me. Oh they pretend they want me to stay and keep talking, but I can tell. I can tell a bullshitter when I hear one. So just don't BS me, Doc, and we'll get along just fine.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I can live with that.  I'm not big on BS myself.  Now what did you mean by getting to the real crux of it?"}, {"instruction": "Hey now, Doc. Hold on. Not so fast. We'll get to that soon enough. But I got to know something right away before we keep on getting on.", "input": "", "output": "And what's that, Mr. Freeman?"}, {"instruction": "Are you one of Them?", "input": "", "output": "One of whom?"}, {"instruction": "Whew. Okay. You're clean. You know, that's the one way you can tell they're Them. They simply can't lie worth a crap. Which works for us because, without that little flaw, we'd be like ducks on a pond. If you were one of Them, you'd have had to say you were. Now at least we can start this association with a clean slate since you're okay.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Mr. Freeman, I must say I can't remember ever being diagnosed so quickly by one of my patients. But since I'm not one of Them, perhaps you can tell me who they are?"}, {"instruction": "All in due time, Doc. Hey, I hope I haven't busted your nuts putting you through that little test. It's just sort of a defense mechanism I've developed over the last couple of years. You just have to be so careful, know what I'm saying? By the way, Doc, think I could have a glass of water?", "input": "", "output": "Certainly Mr. Freeman. The glasses are just over there next to the pitcher. Feel free to walk around if you like.  You seem a little edgy."}, {"instruction": "Well you'd probably be edgy too, if....uh...Doc, what are you writing down there?", "input": "", "output": "I usually take notes during a session.  Is that a problem?"}, {"instruction": "Well hell, Doc. It's not that so much as we've got to be so fucking careful...ah sorry, Doc. Didn't mean to use that word but it just slips out sometimes, you know? Anyway, like I was saying, what I'm saying to you can't go any further than this office. I don't have lots of friends anymore and if they  found out I was here telling you about this, I wouldn't have any. Christ, I'm going to need all the help I can get. And I have to go slow and be careful. No one believes me, so if you don't mind, I'd like to just keep this between me and you. Oh damn, sorry about the mess, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right, Mr. Freeman. It's just water.  These napkins will clean that right up. Do your hands often tremble..."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc, how about calling me Jerry, okay?", "input": "", "output": "As you wish Jerry. Anything you tell me is held in strictest confidence. Except for certain legal obligations I have if I think you or someone else is in imminent danger of bodily harm, there's no way anyone will ever know what we've discussed in this room, Jerry. I do make notes for myself regarding our sessions, but they are under lock and key and no one has access but me. I'm really careful about it.  I wanted to ask about your hands; does that happen frequently?"}, {"instruction": "What? Oh you mean the shaking? Well, Doc, I've got to tell you that it's only been happening off and on for the last couple of years. It doesn't happen very much and usually only lasts for a short spell. But it can be damn embarrassing cause I can't always tell when it's going to happen. Know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "Explain that to me Jerry. Why is it embarrassing?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Doc. You know. When I'm at a bar and start slopping my drink all over the place. Or when I'm on the job and I start dropping equipment or pulling the cables out of their moorings, stuff like that. Or if I'm driving and have to pull over for a few minutes, especially if my girl is with me. It's only been really bad once that I remember. God was that a mess. We were at this Denny's you know? Waitress was walking by with a tray full of pancakes and I had just started the shakes--like a real spazoid--and was getting up to go to the can. I didn't see her coming and jumped up right into her. Man, that food went everywhere. Syrup, butter, sausage, bacon...looked like a damn food fight. I sure got out of there as fast as I could, you can bet on that. But most of the time, it's no big deal.", "input": "", "output": "You said earlier that you don't have a lot of friends, but you mentioned your girl.  Is she one of them?"}, {"instruction": "Goddamn it, Doc!. She's not one of Them and if you're....oh, I see what you meant. Not one of Them but one of my friends. Sorry to go off on you like that, Doc. Well, she's not my girlfriend in the usual way, know what I mean? I mean, she's like my steady hired girlfriend. We're close and all that but it's not like we're going steady or going to get married or anything like that.", "input": "", "output": "Have you sought medical treatment for this condition? Are you taking any medication?"}, {"instruction": "Naw. As I said, Doc, it just isn't that big a thing. It doesn't bother me much really and it never lasts long. I can live with it. See--I'm already over it. No need to bother with it, Doc. If that's all I had to worry about, my life wouldn't be such a fucking...ah shit, Doc, said it again.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay Jerry. I've heard it before and I'm not offended by profanity. What's important is that you express what really on your mind. After all, that's why you're here."}, {"instruction": "I've got to hand it to you, Doc. You sure do make a person feel welcome here. I already can see I'm two lengths ahead of where I was with those other doctors. Anyway, I don't need no medicine because I've got to keep my head clear. These shakes don't mean a thing compared to what's ahead, you know?", "input": "", "output": "No I don't know.  What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Doc, let me ask you something. Have you ever wondered about what's beneath this city of ours? You ever been walking to your car at night or going to lunch during the day and felt someone watching you? Ever get that greasy feeling that comes when someone's eyeballing you and  you don't really know where it's coming from?", "input": "", "output": "Well Jerry..."}, {"instruction": "Ah that's okay, Doc. You don't have to answer. It happens to everyone sooner or later. If you haven't felt it yet, you will. Everyone will. And not just this city either, I can tell you that. We're in for big trouble. And the damn authorities aren't doing one single thing about it. Serve the whole city right when this thing rears up and bites them in the ass. You'd think with all the evidence mounting up someone would sure as hell listen. But no. They leave it to a couple of us to deal with the problem. Freaking politicians. I tell you, Doc, all of humanity--men, women and children--are in for a rude awakening. That day is coming, sure as sh...uh, sure as I'm sitting here.", "input": "", "output": "Well Mr. Freeman, I'm still not sure I understand what the threat is that you're talking about.  But we're almost out of time for this session. It sounds like we've got a lot to discuss in future sessions."}, {"instruction": "What's the matter, Doc? Cutting me short? You think I'm crazy, don't you? Well hell. I knew I should've taken it a lot slower. It's just that I get fired up and can't talk fast enough to get everything out that I want to say. It's just like those other times. Either I talk too much about stuff I don't need to talk about or I don't talk enough about the important stuff. I tell you, Doc, sometimes I just don't know where to begin. There's so much to worry about and so little time. I'm not getting anywhere with this problem, see, and it's driving me nuts. I was hoping you'd be the one to listen. I nosed around and made inquiries, you know? No one knows I'm coming to see you but I did my homework. You seemed to be the guy with the best reputation so I made the appointment. Guess I've scared you off, right?", "input": "", "output": "Absolutely not Jerry. I think we've made excellent  progress for a first session. You've done just fine, Jerry."}, {"instruction": "Maybe, maybe not. But I'm willing to give it another shot if you are, Doc. One last thing though. I have to sort of sneak away from work to come here. I'm on what the city calls a sliding schedule. Sometimes I work weekends, other times 6 days in a row. Stuff like that. No one at work  knows I'm coming here and that's the way I want to keep it.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have a schedule in mind, Jerry? Normally we schedule sessions about once a week, but if that's not convenient, we'll work around it."}, {"instruction": "How about every ten days or so? Will that work? Maybe three times a month. That gives me the chance to work it out on my schedule with no one noticing anything strange. Mondays and  Fridays always seem to work out because no one much worries about people taking long weekends. But you're the doctor, Doc. If I have to come once a week, I'll work it out. I need to talk to someone in authority who'll listen and...damn, there goes my beeper. Next time I'm going to turn the sucker off. Oh, and early in the morning is best for me, Doc, before I get all filthy dirty from the job. Man, you wouldn't want me in here with that smell we get sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Jerry, I'm sure we can work something out. Let's see, how about Friday, March 14th at 9 am? Can you make that?"}, {"instruction": "That sounds good, Doc. Gives me plenty of time to arrange it so no one suspects.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, the 14th it is then. And Mr. Freeman, here's my card with my number on it. My service can get ahold of me day or night.  Please feel free to call me if you need to."}, {"instruction": "Hey thanks, Doc. It's good to know there's someone I can call. See you next time.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Jerry."}, {"instruction": "Hiya, Doc. Sorry I'm late.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Jerry. Good to see you. It's all right; you're only ten minutes late. No harm done."}, {"instruction": "Thought I was being followed. Had to change direction before I got here just to make sure. I'll be okay as soon as I catch my breath.", "input": "", "output": "Jerry, here's a glass of water. Just take your time, we can begin as soon as you're ready."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doc. That helps.", "input": "", "output": "Jerry, might I ask how you get here?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, Doc. I drive my car. It's an old wreck I use to get back and forth to work in. Where I work, you sure don't want to park anything new in that lot. There's tons of big equipment in the yard and on dry windy days, there's dust and dirt just flying everywhere. On rainy days, we come out of there with two inches of mud and sludge on top of all the crap--sorry about the pun--all the glop we get from down in the sewer chambers and tunnels. Of course from there, we take city vehicles--trucks, vans, cars...you name it--and head on out to our assignments. Oh yeah, you asked about getting here. Well, I drive my old heap over this way, then park about two to three blocks away. That way, I have a better chance of seeing if anyone is tailing me.", "input": "", "output": "You seem concerned about being followed or watched, Jerry. Could you expand on that?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. But here's where you're really going to start to think I'm nuts. Doc, I'm going to tell you a little story that you probably won't believe, but here goes. Do you remember seeing the news about the big sewer collapse last year, the one that swallowed a house?", "input": "", "output": "Wasn't that around the Sea Cliff area?"}, {"instruction": "That's the one, Doc. Well, if you recall, the newspapers treated that as an accident. They blamed it on that century-old sewer line and the storm that came through that night. A natural occurrence or maybe one that was caused by bad maintenance or a man-made problem, but just the kind of thing that occasionally happens. In fact, there have been sinkholes and sewer collapses in Florida, Virginia, Minnesota...hell Doc, just about everywhere. I'm here to tell you that the San Francisco sewer collapse was no accident. You might remember that one person was killed there. Well, guess what, Doc. He was one of us--one of the few who knew about Them and they killed him.", "input": "", "output": "He was killed underground, wasn't he?"}, {"instruction": "Damn right, Doc. The papers made out that he was just some schmuck that worked with the City of San Francisco Sanitation Department. The story goes that he was down there doing some surveying on the Richmond Transport project tube.  We're always going down in the tunnels--usually we go out to check out bad smells, gas leaks, that sort of thing.  We get calls all the time.  Usually there's nothing wrong, but we've got to check out every single complaint. Normally we don't go below unless we're in teams. But for some reason, Jake was down there by himself that particular time. There's no real rule that says we've got to go in teams, but it's something that most of us who are aware of the problem have been doing lately. Anyway, Doc, Jake paid for it big time.", "input": "", "output": "So what happened, Jerry? Why do you feel his death wasn't an accident?"}, {"instruction": "Doc, the newspapers didn't investigate the whole story, as usual. And if they did, they sure as hell didn't report the whole thing. Part of our job, any time there is a suspected leak or bad smell or anything at all strange coming from the sewers or drains in an area, is to canvass the neighborhood. Talk to anyone and everyone we can. Some people notice things while other folks don't have a clue. Course it could just be the way the wind blows at a particular time, you know what I'm saying, Doc? Anyway, after the so called accident, me and a few of my crew buddies checked out the neighborhood. You want to know what we found out, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Jerry, I..."}, {"instruction": "Well I'll tell you, Doc. We found about ten people who all felt an explosion before the sewer collapsed. Some of them said they thought it was a small earthquake tremor--a really minor one. But we checked, Doc. There was no recorded tremor at that time, that day. What those folks felt had to be an explosion, for sure.", "input": "", "output": "Are you saying you feel there was a deliberate explosion set off to cause the sewer collapse?"}, {"instruction": "Hell yes, Doc! Think about it. There's poor old Jake down there, all by himself. Now Jake is...was one of us. He knew about Them. My guess is he finally caught sight of one. Really made a discovery, you know? And they killed him. Don't know how they pulled it off so fast, but I'm positive he was snuffed, just like that. He got too close, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Jerry, that's quite a story. Did you report your suspicions to the authorities?"}, {"instruction": "Jesus Christ, Doc! Of course not. I told you before that the fat ass city officials think anyone who talks about Them is crazy. Hell, we learned a long time ago that those bastards in City Hall aren't the least bit interested in anything below the City. As long as the sewers stay unclogged and we don't have water main leaks and the mayor's yard stays green and the goddamn politicians aren't inconvenienced by missing babies in their district....", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Jerry. Just sit down for a bit.  You seem a bit dizzy."}, {"instruction": "Doc, Jake was my friend. I knew his wife and two kids for God's sake. We actually went to see the Giants a couple of times. Hell, I counted him as one of the few friends I really had, Doc. And the SOBs just wrote him off like he was nothing. To them, hell, he was nothing. None of us mean a damn thing to the people in this city, Doc. It's like we're invisible. As long as we keep the shit flowing, man, everyone's happy. But let something go wrong...bam! You never hear so much whining and complaining, and I tell you, Doc, the bullshit factor goes through the roof. Jake didn't deserve to die the way he did. And we're going to get the goddamn Chud's for it, I can tell you that!", "input": "", "output": "Okay, just try to relax a little bit. Take a breather, try to calm down. I understand how you could be upset over the death of your friend, Jerry. Would you like some more water?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. Thanks, Doc. It's just that I get so worked up when I think about it.", "input": "", "output": "That's understandable, Jerry. You mentioned Chuds--I think that's what you said. Is that a reference to Them?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, that. Well yeah, Doc. It's a reference to Them but it's not what they are. Chud is just a name we gave Them because it's easy to say and it... hell, we didn't have anything else to call Them. There was an old movie--you might've seen it, Doc--called C.H.U.D. It stood for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers. Well, that's not an accurate description of what we're up against, but the name was convenient, so we use it. It's just a nickname we use.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Could you tell me more about Them, Jerry?  What they are, what they look like, that sort of thing?"}, {"instruction": "That's kind of hard to answer, Doc. You see, no one's really got a decent look at one of Them yet, the underground ones anyway.", "input": "", "output": "So you're saying that a group of you know they are there, but haven't actually seen one of Them yet?"}, {"instruction": "I knew you'd think I was crazy, Doc. I just knew it.", "input": "", "output": "Jerry, I'm just trying to understand exactly what you're telling me."}, {"instruction": "There's two kinds, Doc. The ones down below are sneaky, dark and smart. Man are they smart. That's a big part of the problem, you know? Wherever we string the lights in the tunnels, or wherever the electricity still works on the permanent fixtures, you won't see Them. They are always just smart enough and quick enough to stay out of sight. And the damage they do. Man, it's costing the taxpayers a fortune just to replace the lights they break. Doesn't matter that most of the lights are in wire cages, they get broken anyway. The only way you can really see'em is when you jerk your head around unexpectedly, and then, maybe then, you catch movement out of the corner of your eye. But they are there, Doc. Goddamn as sure as I'm sitting here, they're there.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think they want?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's the tough part, Doc. We're not sure yet exactly what they are after. But they are massing. We know that for sure. There's been more and more sightings, especially in recent months. We know they're up to something and whatever it is, it ain't going to be pleasant when they spring it on us. And we know they can kill. Poor Jake...hell of a way to go.", "input": "", "output": "You said there were two kinds, Jerry. What's the second kind?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry Doc, I've got to get out of here. Been sitting too long. How about if we take that up the next time I'm here, okay? Talking about Jake upsets me and now I've got a mother of a headache. Think we can finish this up? I've got to get to work even though this was supposed to be one of my off days. Told them I had a doctor's appointment for hemorrhoids this morning, but that I'd be in later. I figured they wouldn't question anyone who's telling them he has a pain in the ass, huh Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Probably right, Jerry. Our time is nearly up anyway. But before we finish, I wanted to ask if you've had more incidents with your hands shaking since I last saw you."}, {"instruction": "To tell you the truth, Doc, yes. I had a couple of times when I got the shakes for a few minutes. But the shakes aren't my problem. Hell, didn't hardly bother me at all, they went away so fast. But, there was one....", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Jerry?"}, {"instruction": "Oh sorry, Doc. Sort of wigged out on you there for a second. Uh, there was one big incident as you call it. My girlfriend--the one I told you about?  Well, she and I were just getting it on after getting home from this bar--Do you know the Skeleton Key, a bar near the Waterfront?--well anyway, we were in my apartment and she was, like, well...climbing on me. Hell, Doc, you know what I mean, don't you? Anyway, I'm laying there and she's bouncing up and down and son of a bitch if my hands didn't start shaking like a bastard. Hell, Doc...she loved it. I just grabbed ahold of her tits and held on for dear life.  Hands were shaking so bad she didn't have a clue I wasn't doing it on purpose. Drove her nuts, man. First time the damn shakes ever did anything good for me, you know, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Well yes, Jerry. I get the picture. I still think we might want to look into some medications though. Will you think about it before our next visit?"}, {"instruction": "I got to stay sharp.  But I'll think about it.  Sure thing, Doc. Will do.", "input": "", "output": "How does Monday, the 24th, at nine in the morning look for you, Jerry?"}, {"instruction": "That'll be great, Doc. See you then. And, hey, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Jerry?"}, {"instruction": "You're okay, you know that? You're okay. See you next time.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Jerry. Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "I guess so, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Jerry, is everything all right? You seem a bit down this morning."}, {"instruction": "I'm tired, Doc. Very tired. Almost didn't show up here today and I'm thinking about calling the bastards at work and telling them I'm not coming in. Supposed to be my off day and, as usual, they've got some goddamn emergency they need me for. I may just tell 'em to kiss my ass and find some other stooge to fix the damn problems. Mind if I use the couch today, Doc? Ah, this sure does feel good on my aching back.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm glad you chose to keep the session, Jerry. What's making you so tired this morning?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, Doc. I haven't been sleeping too well the last few nights.", "input": "", "output": "And why is that, Jerry? Is something in particular bothering you, something else besides Them?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's part of the problem. Since I last saw you, I haven't really seen Them at all. Not one time and that worries me. A lot.", "input": "", "output": "But isn't that a good thing?"}, {"instruction": "You just don't understand, Doc. If you can't see 'em, then you got to figure they're up to something. Hell, I don't know. It all gets to be such a pain in the ass sometimes. Damn work's hard enough as it is, but when you've got to worry about all this other shit too, man, that becomes real tiresome, Doc, know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "You seem to have a lot on your mind today, Jerry. Are all these physical problems--the tremors, the aching back, tiredness--usual for you? Do you have other physical problems as well?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean by that, Doc? What other problems could I have? Have you been talking to someone about me? Do I look like I have physical problems?", "input": "", "output": "No, Jerry. It was a simple question from your doctor. But I gather you'd rather not talk to me about it, even though it's obviously bothering you.  We can come back to it later if you'd rather."}, {"instruction": "Ah, hell, Doc. I keep forgetting how good you are. I have been having another problem lately but it's not something I like talking about. Hell, no one would want to. It's never happened before in my life and it pisses me off. Man, I've never had a problem like this before.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Jerry, I gather it's something very personal.  Are you referring to sexual prowess?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, Doc. You might say that. The last couple times I was with Diane I just haven't been able to...well, to get it up. Well, I mean I can get it up but I just can't keep it....damn, Doc! This is embarrassing as all hell.", "input": "", "output": "Jerry, there's nothing to be embarrassed about. Most men go through a period very similar to this at some point in their lives."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. Well, that doesn't help me much, does it? I don't know about other men, but I've never had this problem in my life. Hell, I'm usually good to go all night if I want to.", "input": "", "output": "I assume Diane is your girlfriend?"}, {"instruction": "That's right, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "And what has her reaction been to your problem?"}, {"instruction": "She's, well, surprised about it, Doc. Just like me. She hasn't complained but, hell, I don't know if that's because I take care of her in other ways or because she knows if she does, I won't keep her around anymore. She's basically a good woman, Doc, and I hate disappointing her that way.", "input": "", "output": "Let's talk about Diane a little bit, Jerry. You mentioned that she was, I think the phrase you used, your hired girlfriend. What did you mean by that?"}, {"instruction": "Damn, did I say that, Doc? Well, it's not exactly what it sounds like. It's not like she's a street whore or a dime a night hooker, man. She's like a...well...I mean she's...", "input": "", "output": "Are you trying to say she's like a paid companion, Jerry?"}, {"instruction": "No, it's not like that, Doc. What I mean is that I take care of her. She stays at my place most of the time and I make sure she has clothes, a place to sleep, food to eat, that sort of stuff. And I give her money so she doesn't have to go back to doing what she used to do before I met her. Before we hooked up with each other.", "input": "", "output": "I assume she used to be a prostitute?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah. I guess you could say that. But she wasn't a cheap one, Doc. She was just on hard times, you know? She's too pretty to live like that. She's really got a lot on the ball, Doc. She's fun, sexy, and she understands me. She doesn't laugh at me when I talk about Them. She'll do just about anything for me, and I can't believe I'm telling you all this stuff. She's not my problem, Doc. I just need to make sure she doesn't have to trick anymore, that's all. I don't know what my problem is, but if I don't get it fixed, I don't know what she'll do.", "input": "", "output": "Just relax, Jerry. There are many reasons which can prevent a man from maintaining an erection. Part of our purpose here is to find out what's behind your particular situation. Stress, overwork, tiredness are some possible factors.  This isn't a unique problem and I'm sure it's treatable and not permanent, if that's what got you concerned."}, {"instruction": "Hell yes, Doc. It's got me concerned. Wouldn't it have you worried and pissed off if it happened to you?", "input": "", "output": "And your concern is very natural, Jerry. Very normal. You seem to be sexually active and I assume you haven't had performance problems before, so naturally any interruption in that area will be upsetting to you."}, {"instruction": "Damn right. I'm a good performer, Doc. Just ask Diane. I mean with her past history, if I wasn't, she'd be the first to know. But I've never had any complaints, hell, just the opposite. She used to think she couldn't enjoy fucking with anyone anymore, but that all changed when she and I got together. In fact, Doc, that's one of the things she says she loves about me. Of course she's talking about my dick not me, but hell, I'll take it. I know she likes me for other things too. It's not just the sex part that she hangs around for. We have fun together.", "input": "", "output": "Diane sounds like quite a lady, Jerry. Perhaps you could expand a little on the actual problem itself. Are you doing anything differently--perhaps a different location?  Anything out of the ordinary?"}, {"instruction": "No, Doc. Nothing different that I can think of. One of the great things about Diane is she's pretty much willing to do it whenever and wherever we feel like it. Man, we've had some great times and done it in some really strange places. But, most of the time, it's just in my apartment, Doc. At least the last two times have been and goddamn it, Doc, I just don't get it. It's like any other time. We just start getting it on and hell, Doc, I'm like a flagpole. She climbs on and then about 5 minutes later, boom! She hasn't made it yet and I crap out. I mean it just fizzles, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Jerry, about how long does a normal session between you and Diane last?"}, {"instruction": "Always until she gets off, Doc. With her, that means anywhere from half an hour to all night. And even if I come early, I'm usually right back up there within minutes after she's...well, you know what I mean. Hell, it can be more than once a night. Usually is. Damn, I get horny just thinking about it.", "input": "", "output": "You seem very tense, Jerry.  I think that could explain your difficulties."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know, Doc. There is something else, though. I just remembered that when Diane and I were going at it last time, my mind sort of wandered. It was like I wasn't there with her anymore, kind of dozed off...no that's not right...sort of, ah hell, Doc, I can't say exactly what it was. Like my mind was pulled somewhere else for a few minutes. When I came back, I realized that Diane was just sitting there, waiting for me to do something. But by then, it was too late. I couldn't get it back up.", "input": "", "output": "A loss of concentration, or a focus on performance instead of sensation is the usual cause of an inability to maintain an erection once it has been achieved.  If you said that you were having trouble initially achieving an erection, I might be more concerned.  But losing an erection once achieved is almost always treatable.  So there's nothing to panic about at this stage, Jerry. Let's just see what happens between now and when we meet again."}, {"instruction": "Okay, you're the doc, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Jerry, our time is nearly up for this session, but is there anything else in particular you'd like to talk about in the time remaining?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah, er...Doc, one thing has been bothering me lately.", "input": "", "output": "And what's that, Jerry."}, {"instruction": "Well, Doc, I'm an honest guy. I told you that way back at the beginning. I don't like bullshit or bullshitters. But, well, Doc...I, uh...I haven't told you the real reason why I'm here.", "input": "", "output": "Jerry, that's all right. Many people have different reasons for coming to a psychiatrist and often don't explain why they come until they've gotten comfortable with their doctor."}, {"instruction": "This is hard, Doc. Actually, I've been forced to come here. The pricks that I work for--my supervisor--well, he called me in a few weeks ago and said that if I didn't start getting some help, he'd have to reevaluate how much I was worth to the city.", "input": "", "output": "Why does your supervisor think you need help?"}, {"instruction": "It's Them, Doc. I told you, no one wants to talk about Them. They're real, man. They are. It's just that no one else seems to see 'em as often as I do. When Jake was killed, I started letting it be known that I knew why he was killed. The bosses got pissed off about that. But Jake was my friend and his dying just couldn't be swept under the carpet, man. The bastards killed him and someone's got to do something about it.", "input": "", "output": "The other doctors you mentioned. Did you go to see them also because of your supervisor?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, sort of. They weren't as serious about me needing help back then, though. So I went a couple of times and then just sort of faded away, never went back. The prick I work for seemed to be satisfied. I learned to keep my mouth shut and that made 'em happy. But when Jake died, I just couldn't let it go.", "input": "", "output": "So did you choose me or did your supervisor?"}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. That part was true. I checked around and you really did have the best reputation, so I chose you. The only person that knows I'm coming here is my supervisor, the prick. Oh, and Diane knows too.", "input": "", "output": "Well, thank you for the compliment, Jerry."}, {"instruction": "I'm glad I told you, Doc. That was bothering me a lot. I don't like lying and it feels better knowing you know. And as much as I hated the thoughts of seeing someone, I got to tell you, Doc, it hasn't been half bad coming here.", "input": "", "output": "Jerry, I think we're making good progress here. Give me a while and I'll get a recommendation on a good internist who is on the city's health plan.  If you don't mind, I'd like to get you checked out so we can rule out some physical stuff, okay?  So, let's see.  I know you like to stagger these sessions.  How does Friday, April 4th look.  It has to be in the morning, right?  How about the 4th at 9 am?"}, {"instruction": "That'll be great, Doc.  You want me to see another doctor?  You think I'm sick or something?", "input": "", "output": "Jerry, I just want to play it safe.  With the tremors and exhaustion, I think it couldn't hurt to be sure, okay?  Great.  I'll see you on Friday."}, {"instruction": "Ah, Doc...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Watch your back, Doc. They're still out there.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks for the advice, Jerry. See you next time."}, {"instruction": "Hi Doc. Almost couldn't make it again today.", "input": "", "output": "Another emergency? Or is there some other problem?"}, {"instruction": "Emergency? No, I'm just not feeling good and thought about staying home in bed.", "input": "", "output": "How has your health been the last couple of weeks? Let's see, I haven't seen you since last month--about three weeks ago."}, {"instruction": "Can't complain too much, Doc. Been getting lots of rest. Took a few days off work. You know, mental health days and all that.", "input": "", "output": "Have things been particularly stressful at work recently?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you could say that, Doc. The bastards have been trying to run me into the ground lately. I can only take it for so long. I've got plenty of sick leave coming to me, but the sons-of-bitches act like it's their own leave I'm using. Man, I don't think I can stand that place much longer.", "input": "", "output": "Is there something particular about work that's adding to your stress?"}, {"instruction": "Lots of things.", "input": "", "output": "For instance?"}, {"instruction": "I'll give you a for instance. Last week, I was supposed to work the day shift with my regular crew. So I worked it; put in a good nine hour day, in fact. When I'm getting ready to leave, the foreman comes over and says, \"Hey, Jerry. Two men called in sick tonight and we've got that pipeline problem over in the Sunset. We really need you to put in some extra time and help out over there. Is that going to be a problem?\" Well, Doc, the way he said it made it clear that I wasn't supposed to have a problem, you know? Hell, I was going to do something special with Diane that night and I told him, \"Yeah. It's a problem. Can't do it.\" So then I get this big goddamn lecture about how I need to be more dedicated to the city and the job. I couldn't believe it.", "input": "", "output": "So what did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I left. Told him it wasn't my problem and I'd already done nine hours. Told him to find some other patsy to play his mind games with.", "input": "", "output": "Does this sort of thing happen very often at your work, Jerry?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's been happening a hell of lot more recently than it used to. And I'm getting pretty fucking tired of them always coming crying to me to help bail them out when there're big problems.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever considered it as a sort of compliment? That they recognize your work abilities and are asking you to help out because you're good at what you do?"}, {"instruction": "No. I can recognize bullshit when I hear it, Doc. They're just trying to get more work out of me and a few others. The damn city won't pay for more workers, so we're spread pretty thin as it is. I say if the city has big problems, then they damn well can hire some more workers. It's like I've said before, the fat cats at city hall don't really give a damn about us. As long as the pipes stay clear and the shit keeps flowing, they're happy.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you've said that before. You seem to have a fairly negative outlook on your bosses, Jerry. Is it just this particular foreman or have you always had problems with those in higher authority?"}, {"instruction": "Nah. All the pricks in authority are scumbags. This guy isn't any worse than any other boss I've had, but he can be a real asshole at times.", "input": "", "output": "Have you always had a low opinion of those in authority, Jerry?"}, {"instruction": "Is this where you really start to play Doctor, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Jerry, I'm here to help you smooth out some of your problems. One of the best ways to find out what those problems really are is to discuss anything and everything that relates to your home life, work and past. It's a standard technique psychiatrists use--almost like free association--and it works sometimes to get at the root of problems.  But it's also my job to try and focus on those areas in your life that may be the cause of any obvious distress affecting your daily well-being."}, {"instruction": "Sorry, Doc. Didn't mean to get you riled up.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not riled up, Jerry, but you must understand that I'm not your enemy. I'm here as a friend.  You can count on that.  But I can only help you if you're willing to help yourself. If we don't have trust here, we're wasting each other's time. And that trust has to be a two-way street."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doc. Chill out. I get the message. Hell, I've never been good at talking about myself and you ask some damn good questions. All right, authority.  My whole life I've never liked those people who try to put themselves above you, you know? Like you're some toad that they can just throw around and squash flat whenever they don't need you.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you don't see me in that same light."}, {"instruction": "What? Oh hell no, Doc. I mean people like teachers and bosses.", "input": "", "output": "How about parents, Jerry? Any problems with them?"}, {"instruction": "Parents? Why'd you ask about my parents?", "input": "", "output": "Well, often problems with authority can be traced back to problems with authority figures in early childhood--parents.  You seem to be reluctant to have me ask questions about certain things.  I think we need to explore these areas, but if you don't want to talk about your parents, you can just say so."}, {"instruction": "Well, what do you want to know about them?", "input": "", "output": "Anything you'd care to share with me. Were they lenient? Harsh? Strict? Loving?"}, {"instruction": "Lenient, ha! Loving? My mother was in her own way, I suppose. But my father, now there was a real bastard if I ever saw one. Do you know that son of a bitch used to whip me with a goddamn cane until I was old enough to...", "input": "", "output": "You stopped."}, {"instruction": "Ah shit, Doc. I've never talked about my parents to anyone. No one ever knew the things my father did to me before he died. I try not to think about him too much. The old bastard is dead and buried and that's the best thing he ever did for me.", "input": "", "output": "Why did he beat you, Jerry? When did he stop?"}, {"instruction": "He didn't need a reason. He'd come home all pissed off for some goddamn reason or another and start in on my mother. Usually I'd get in his way just to keep him from getting on her. Hell, he didn't like the dinner she'd fixed or he didn't like the dress she was wearing or her hair wasn't combed just right--man, he really didn't need a reason like I said. Hell, we couldn't ever please the old fucker and I gave up trying.", "input": "", "output": "Did your father beat your mother too, Jerry?"}, {"instruction": "When I was younger, I think he did. But he'd do it when I wasn't around or couldn't see him doing it. But I'd see her with a black eye or bruises on her arm. Once, I remember now, she couldn't sit down very well for about two days. I don't know what the prick did to her that time.", "input": "", "output": "You said when you were younger. What happened as you grew older?"}, {"instruction": "I got fed up with him. When I was about sixteen, I was damn near as big as I am now. He used to have this limp--he got it in the prison he worked at I think--and he always used this bamboo cane with a dragon's head on the top of it. Man, I hated that thing. He came home one night and started screaming at my mother for no good reason at all. She never back-talked him but this one time, I remember, she said something to him that really pissed him off. Don't even remember what she said, just that she made some comment. He hit her across the back with that damn dragon's head, and when she fell to the floor, I came up behind the fucker and grabbed the cane when he swung it around to hit her again. I can still see the surprise on his face.", "input": "", "output": "And what did you do with the cane, Jerry?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's the funny part, Doc. He took a step toward me and I told him flat out that if he touched me, I'd kill him. And if he ever touched my mother again, I'd kill him. He didn't believe me. He screamed that I was a stupid ass son of a bitch and I'd better give him the cane or he'd whip me like never before. I was scared and I remember backing up a couple of steps. He limped toward me and reached out to get the cane and I was just getting ready to hit him with every bit of strength I had. Man, I was going to lay that dragon's head across his face as hard as I could.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Jerry. Would you like to take a break? Get some water?"}, {"instruction": "No. I can't believe I'm telling you this. No one but the police ever really knew what happened.", "input": "", "output": "And what was that, Jerry?"}, {"instruction": "Well, all this happened in the kitchen. When he came after me, my mother had dragged herself up by holding onto the counter by the sink. Since he had his back turned to her, he never saw her coming. She'd been tenderizing the steak or whatever the hell meat we were having for dinner and grabbed a hold of that hammer-like thing she used to pound the meat. She swung it with all her might and I'll never forget the sound that made. She must have buried the damn thing three inches into the back of his skull. His eyes rolled up in his head and he just fell forward toward me like a falling tree. I jumped back out of the way and looked at my mother and loved her more that minute than I had my whole life. I swung that cane as hard as I could and hit that bastard in the same spot my mother had hit him with the hammer. The fucker was dead, there was no doubt about that.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's quite a story, Jerry. How did your friends and relatives react when they found out what happened?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't have many friends. But my mother's sister was happy as hell. She never could stand the old bastard anyway. No one really knew, like I said, but the police. After my mother and I told our story, it was written off as self-defense--hers, not mine--and it was almost like the prick never existed. He was one sadistic piece of shit, I can tell you that.", "input": "", "output": "And where's your mother today?"}, {"instruction": "She's..ah, well. She's not doing too well. She stays at her sister's house. She doesn't get around too good anymore and, ever since she killed the old man, she's been kind of slow. It's almost like she's in a dream most of the time but she's comfortable.", "input": "", "output": "That's an extremely tragic story, Jerry. I can see where your difficulties with authority figures might stem from your past history with your father. I'd like to pursue this line of discussion in our next session if that would be all right with you. I'd also like to hear more about your father and his prison work."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess so, Doc. I can't believe the hour is up already. It's unbelievable to me that I just told you all this stuff about my old man that I haven't thought about or told anyone about since it happened.", "input": "", "output": "You did very well today, Jerry. I'm very pleased with our progress. One question, though. Have you had any progress with your sexual problem?"}, {"instruction": "Couldn't be better, Doc. Me and Diane been going at it like rabbits. She's special, Doc. Really special.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad the medication is working, Jerry.  I'd like to meet Diane someday, Jerry. She sounds like she's straightened out her life pretty well considering her past."}, {"instruction": "Her past? What do you...oh, right. Well, I've got to run, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Jerry. Let's see, we're on a staggered weekly schedule.  How's Friday, April 25th at 9 am sound?"}, {"instruction": "That'll be great, Doc. See you then.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Jerry."}]
