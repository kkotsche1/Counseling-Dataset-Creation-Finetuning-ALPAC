My husband and I have been married for several years. It was a wonderful, whirlwind romance. We must have fallen in love with each other the moment our eyes met.

My husband didn't.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "Now that we are parents and have to be \"real\" adults, I'm the one carrying the weight of the family.

I'm still trying to breast-feed my baby. That, in and of itself, is a difficult task. At first, I would meet Jesse at lunch and feed Natalie. But that was just too difficult, so I've started expressing milk several times during the day. I feel very strongly about nursing Natalie for several more months.

I feel very self-conscious doing it in the rest room because the pump is electric and noisy. I finally ended up using a small conference room. That's stress number one. On top of that is my desire for a promotion. I've been working very hard to get ahead at SII. I'm hoping that I'll be promoted to a department head in the not too distant future.

He could come back for me. Am I being paranoid?", "input": "", "output": "No, you're not being paranoid, Madeline. I think that your fears are based on very real circumstances. As a victim of a brutal attack, you are on the defensive and your survival instinct is working overtime.

I've noticed that when I don't go along, we end up with Cookie Crisps for dinner. Sometimes, it makes me want to scream. Other times, I just laugh and grab a bowl.", "input": "", "output": "Do you and Jesse laugh a lot together?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Jesse was always a bit of a joker. He has a knack for saying the simplest thing and making me fall to the floor laughing. During some of the darker moments in our marriage, there wasn't a lot of laughter, but we seemed to be able to revel in each other's love and that got us through. With the upcoming trial, it's been harder to re-center our focus.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have an attorney?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. The Rape Crisis Center helped me find an attorney I could afford. Her name is Clarice Atwood. But there's really not much she can do except advise me outside of court. I have to testify, whether I like it or not. They will treat me as a hostile witness.", "input": "", "output": "Have you met with the defense?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I met with the attorney, Mr. Shuller, last week. He's slimy. I expected some poor, court-appointed attorney, not Mr. Shuller.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Mr. Shuller is...how do I put this...in a word, he's scum. He kept giving me the hairy eyeball the whole time I was there. It was most disconcerting.", "input": "", "output": "Pardon me? \"The hairy eyeball?\""}, {"instruction": "You know, he was looking me up and down and undressing me with his eyes. I did not appreciate it. At one point, I told him that if he continued to treat me with such disrespect, he wouldn't see me again until I was called upon to testify. I didn't have to be there talking to him. I only did so on the advice of my attorney. Clarice felt it would be better if I knew in advance what he plans to ask me on the stand.", "input": "", "output": "That will help alleviate some of your anxiety."}, {"instruction": "I hope so. When I was a kid, I used to put two pencils inside a rubber band and twist one of the pencils until the rubber band was tightly wound. Then, when I let go of one end, the pencil spun out of control. That's how I feel right now--I'm at the tightly wound point. I've been thinking about taking up kick boxing, but I'm not sure how my husband would react.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "After the rape, he told me that he felt so helpless to defend me. He was out of town when I was raped. I think it really bothered him that he couldn't do anything to avenge my attack. I'm afraid he might see my interest in kick boxing as a reflection of his inadequacy as a protector.", "input": "", "output": "Have you discussed this with Jesse?"}, {"instruction": "No, not yet. It's a non-issue now anyway. It's a bit uncomfortable to do any kind of aerobic exercise when you're carrying two leaky milk sacks on your chest. It's okay, Doctor Balis, you can laugh. Lord knows, I crack bovine jokes all day.", "input": "", "output": "That's an interesting way of looking at it."}, {"instruction": "Doc, as much as I enjoy nursing and being a mother, there are days when I feel like Natalie is never going to let go!", "input": "", "output": "Many women express that same conflict. They love the bond nursing provides with their baby, yet, they also feel like their sole purpose is to produce milk."}, {"instruction": "Exactly! Now that I'm back at work, it's so much harder to get up for the nightly feedings. Since she gets bottles during the day, I feel that I have to make an effort to nurse her whenever I can. I've started sleeping without a top on and letting Natalie sleep on my tummy so she can nurse whenever she needs to.", "input": "", "output": "What do you do to relax, Madeline?"}, {"instruction": "I listen to Mozart and light candles. Scented candles always make me smile. I like Mozart, but I listen to his music mostly for Natalie's benefit--studies have shown that Mozart helps stimulate the brain. Scientists believe that it helps the child's math skills later in life.", "input": "", "output": "I'd heard that."}, {"instruction": "And exposing a child to a foreign language as an infant increases their ability to learn languages later in life. I'm determined to do everything I can to increase Natalie's learning capabilities. If something as simple as popping Mozart into the CD player will help her excel later in life, how can I turn my back on her?", "input": "", "output": "I agree that it's important for you and your husband to encourage Natalie's development, but you also need to take care of yourselves. You've expressed several times how stressed you are. You need to take time out for yourself as well as for your daughter."}, {"instruction": "My life is so focused on Natalie. Sometimes I forget to do the simple things for myself that make me smile.", "input": "", "output": "Such as?"}, {"instruction": "Manicures and pedicures are so relaxing. I can't remember the last time I took an hour or two to visit a salon.", "input": "", "output": "If you find this to be a good way of relaxing, then you should try to find the time. Remember, a child can sense the stress in a parent and will react accordingly."}, {"instruction": "I hadn't thought of it that way. But I guess that's true.", "input": "", "output": "You have an emotional connection to your daughter and it is influenced by your feelings and your sense of happiness and well being."}, {"instruction": "So another way of saying this is that my manicure is good for my daughter's happiness.", "input": "", "output": "If it makes you happy and more relaxed, yes."}, {"instruction": "All right then! I'm giving myself an assignment to get my nails done this week. I also thought of getting a small fish tank--nothing too ornate or outrageous. I just think watching fish can be very soothing.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good idea. And if you find aroma therapy to be a good relaxation..."}, {"instruction": "Yes! The fragrant oils are a great idea! And Jesse's back rubs are exquisite.", "input": "", "output": "An oil rub and a massage, that's very good."}, {"instruction": "Just this past week, we spent an evening laying on the sofa listening to Natalie coo. He had me lay on my stomach while he rubbed my back. It was so relaxing that I almost fell asleep. We really felt like a family that night. It was one of those nights that I will tuck away in my memory and always treasure. Thank you for seeing me, Doctor Balis. I'll do my best to try to relax.", "input": "", "output": "We still have some time."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But I have to get back to work if I'm to take tomorrow off.", "input": "", "output": "All right, then. Take care of yourself, Madeline. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "I hope you like Starbucks coffee, Doctor Balis. I brought an extra cup for you.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. You didn't have to do that; I keep a pot available here for my patients."}, {"instruction": "No big deal, Doc. I stopped on my way here and just decided to pick one up for you as well.", "input": "", "output": "Well, thank you. I appreciate it."}, {"instruction": "I hope everything was all right the last two weeks. You weren't sick, were you?", "input": "", "output": "No. My dad was ill, and I flew out to see him. Thank you for asking. I'm sorry that I had to cancel our appointments. How have you been?"}, {"instruction": "Sorry about your dad. As for me, it's been a bit tense lately. I've started working with some of the sales staff on promotional brochures for SII. We're on a tight deadline, but nobody knows what they want. That seems to be typical of the sales staff. I think that if I can pull this project off smoothly, I'll be looking at some special recognition. I really want to look good to my superiors and work at a promotion. Being Team Lead would only be the first step for me, though. I have some long term goals at SII.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "The trick will be to complete this project without putting in too much overtime. I don't mind working until the job is done, and putting in the time necessary turn out an excellent product, but I worry about my daughter. I'm an advocate of working mothers, but it's not an easy undertaking.", "input": "", "output": "You have a lot of responsibilities...."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, I look at my life now--my responsibilities, my commitments, my circumstances--and I'm amazed at who I've become. I've changed a lot over the past five or so years. When I was in college, I was very carefree and frivolous. After graduation, I started my career. I was a married woman. Suddenly, I realized that being an adult means being a responsible contributor to society. No one ever told me about that part. It used to be so easy--if I had a problem, I just picked up a phone and called my parents. Mommy and Daddy always took care of everything. Now, I am the Mommy. My responsibilities to Natalie are monumental, and I gladly accept them. But how can I teach and guide my daughter through life if I'm never there? I love the idea of staying home with my daughter until she is old enough for school, but that would mean a significant, financial, lifestyle change. It would also mean that once I did go back to work, I'd be starting from scratch again. So what is more important? Providing for my family financially or emotionally? I think both are necessary and crucial.", "input": "", "output": "The key is to find a balance."}, {"instruction": "Is there a \"How To\" book for that? A \"Life for Dummies?\"", "input": "", "output": "I don't think so. We need to work on managing your stress by finding ways for you to relax, appreciate life, and change the stressful situations into exhilarating ones. That will help you find that balance. Let's take a look at the stress factors in your life right now."}, {"instruction": "The trial is looming out there.", "input": "", "output": "What about the small things that frazzle you? Can you eliminate them or change your attitude towards them? Can you let go and not control some of the everyday aspects of your work and family life? By eliminating the smaller stresses, you'll be able to focus better on the larger issues at hand."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. That does sound like a good strategy. If I'll combine that with easy relaxation techniques, I could be on the road to Wellville!", "input": "", "output": "Very few emotional things have a quick fix, Madeline. Some of the smaller issues in your life can sometimes be resolved with simple organization. But little by little, you'll have to start working on the larger issues as well. And that will be hard work."}, {"instruction": "The small issues, hmm? I'm a stickler for time management. I track my workload at work, and I'm always on top of it. I used to not worry about home stuff too much, but since Natalie arrived, things have been so hectic. I think that having a written time schedule would help both me and Jesse to know how to plan our days. I'll suggest it to him. It would be an easy way to alleviate some of my smaller worries, and it would put my mind at ease while I'm at work. I worry about Jesse playing Mr. Mom all day. A tangible schedule would also help me maximize my time with Natalie. This will sound silly, but sometimes I get so jealous of Jesse. He gets the whole day with Natalie. I'm so afraid of missing out on her life. I don't want to be there the thirteenth time she walks or talks, I want to be there the first time. Oh, speaking of motherhood, my mother called me yesterday at the office.", "input": "", "output": "Is that unusual?"}, {"instruction": "She calls me at home; she knows I'm busy when I'm at work.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "My parents have a very different outlook on life than Jesse and I do. They are very religious, very old-fashioned, very set in their ways. They are also rather disapproving of Jesse. He's not perfect, but then who is? He's a good man, and I love him. It seems that nothing he does is ever the \"right thing\" as far as my parents are concerned. They have always insinuated that I should leave Jesse and move back home with them. After the rape, they were adamant that Jesse couldn't take care of me and that I needed someone better. Now that we have Natalie, they seem to find a million ways to tear at Jesse: he's not a good father; he should be supporting his family; he should give up his scooter; he should grow up; blah blah blah. I get so sick of defending him to my parents.", "input": "", "output": "It must be difficult to hear your family berate your husband."}, {"instruction": "I've tried to distance myself from them as much as possible, partly to protect Jesse and partly to keep from screaming at them. But as much as they get on my nerves, I do love them. I do better when I experience my parents in small doses. Jesse knows they don't like him, but he tries to make the best of it. I don't think he has ever been disrespectful to my parents. I really admire him for being able to deal with it so gracefully and with such dignity. Even when they lash out at him, he handles it well. When it's too much for him, he goes out for a drive until he can deal with them civilly. I really respect him for being able to do that. Actually, his parents aren't too keen on me either. And I usually end up speaking my mind when they get snide with me. I really don't understand how my parents can be so vindictive towards Jesse and yet sit in church every week as \"Good Christians.\" They know it hurts me when they disparage Jesse, but they just won't let up.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But back to the phone call, it was yet another futile attempt to woo me away from San Francisco and Jesse.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to go back to St. Louis?"}, {"instruction": "Go back? No. My parents would be insufferable. And aside from that, I really do like living in San Francisco. It's a bit lonely, but it's nice.", "input": "", "output": "Lonely?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't made very many friends here...outside of the Rape Crisis Center, that is. And lately, I've tried to distance myself from them somewhat. Immediately following the rape, my friends at the center were like a warm, safe blanket enveloping me. They welcomed me, supported me, and comforted me. They understood me in ways that no one else could. Because they were rape victims as well, they truly understood my feelings. But somewhere along the way, though, my perception of them had changed.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "They all seem so bitter and hateful. They see all men as the enemy because one man violated them. Sometimes, I think they revel in being victims.", "input": "", "output": "What about you?"}, {"instruction": "A victim? Hmm, in the literal sense, yes, I am a victim. I was the target of a violent crime. However, I don't allow the rape to continuously victimize me.", "input": "", "output": "Can you talk more about that?"}, {"instruction": "It's a matter of moving past what happened, taking all that ugliness and putting it behind me, letting go of it and moving forward with my life. Giving birth to Natalie has helped me with that greatly. The moment Natalie was born, it was like all the darkness was chased away by the light of her smile. She has given me such happiness. I feel like a complete woman because of her. And Jesse has been very supportive. He didn't like my friends from the Center, but he seemed to understand that they were able to offer me support in ways that he couldn't. Even though he doesn't really understand what a nightmare the whole affair was, he has tried hard to show me his love and help me as much as he can. I know I was rough on him after the rape; I was so horrid to him. I had so much anger and fear, and I took it out on him. I had to get past that. I had to move forward and stop the pain. If I were to continuously dwell on the rape, on how scared I was, on how traumatic it was, on all of that chaos, I would be perpetually victimizing myself.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Do you think that the trial will help or impair your healing?"}, {"instruction": "I really don't know. It's certainly bringing back to the surface the fears and insecurities that I thought were gone. I feel out of control again, scared, even dirty. All the ugliness is coming back, and it's making it difficult for me to function normally. I've noticed that I'm jumpy at work and have little patience with people. It took me a while to rid myself of the urge to shower every half hour. I don't want to go back to that. I need to focus on my daughter and on work. The more I talk about what happened, the worse my fears become. If I can just get through the trial without reliving that night, I think I'll be okay.", "input": "", "output": "It will be hard to live through the trial. But I think you need to prepare yourself for describing the events of that day in front of a judge, a jury, and the..."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know.

Will they be able to ask you very personal questions?"}, {"instruction": "That's just in the movies, Doctor Balis. They won't try to infer that I sleep around and dress like a hooker. Nothing could be further from the truth.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I still think you should ask your attorney about the extent of your questioning. Next week, why don't we explore this a bit further, all right?"}, {"instruction": "Our time is up already? Yes, let's discuss this next week.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Enjoy your weekend, Madeline."}, {"instruction": "I've been plugging along like normal, Doctor Balis. It's good to see you.

Maddie, today I'd like to do something a little different, if you don't mind.  I'd like to spend our session first evaluating the stressors in your life and then figuring out how we can reduce them.  I'd like you to really understand how stress works."}, {"instruction": "I think I understand stress.", "input": "", "output": "I know you understand the symptom.  I'd like you to understand the disease.  Is that all right with you?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, what do I do first?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'd like you to take a look at this list. This is a list of the various stressors that can affect a person's psychological well being. I've marked everything that I thought applied to you. I would like you to go over this list and make sure that everything that should be checked has been. Please mark all events that have occurred during the past twelve months. There's no magic associated with this list; it is simply a way for us to gauge how stressed you are."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Please feel free to mark off anything that I've circled incorrectly.  Take your time, I'll work on these notes."}, {"instruction": "Okay, here you go. I've added several items.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Madeline, I'll take a look at your list later. Okay, are you ready for my little lecture--\"The Effects of Stress and How to Minimize Them.\" Understanding stress and how to combat it is paramount. There are many ways to decrease your stress level. One way is to regulate your body clock--the little group of cells known as the pineal gland. Your pineal gland acts as a type of repository of serotonin. On a daily basis, serotonin is chemically converted to melatonin; and then the melatonin is converted right back to serotonin. The whole cycle from serotonin to melatonin and back is called your body clock."}, {"instruction": "What are serotonin and melatonin?", "input": "", "output": "Serotonin and melatonin are hormones and neurotransmitters.  Simply put, melatonin is the chemical in your brain that allows you to sleep. It's responsible for making sure that your body is physiologically ready for sleep. If your brain is not producing the right amount of serotonin, you'll have difficulty falling asleep and resting peacefully. Serotonin is a chemical that helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle."}, {"instruction": "Okay...", "input": "", "output": "For the next two or three weeks, I'd like you to try to regulate your sleep."}, {"instruction": "Hmm...", "input": "", "output": "This means working out a schedule that will allow you to sleep for at least eight hours a night. Since it will take two to three weeks for your body clock to synch up with a new schedule, it's imperative that you stick to the schedule. Next week, I want to know how much success you've had doing this on your own. If you have problems sleeping, I'll look into some medication..."}, {"instruction": "What if I can't fall asleep?", "input": "", "output": "If you've tried to fall asleep but are still awake after forty-five minutes, try reading a book. Sooner or later, you'll start to feel sleepy. Try to go to bed at the same time each night. Eventually, your body clock will kick in. Since you are still nursing Natalie at night, it will be hard for you to get a full night's sleep. I know how strongly you feel about nursing Natalie, but if you can, delegate the midnight feedings to Jesse."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, Doctor Balis. I'd feel like I was shirking my responsibility. Besides, I really do enjoy nursing her.", "input": "", "output": "It's something to consider. And you don't need to make this decision right away. Last week, we've discussed creating a schedule for you. Have you tried it?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. And I feel less tense than before. I feel like my brain is better organized. And my memory has improved--I used to forget little things all the time.", "input": "", "output": "Good! Keeping a regular schedule is another way to help get your body clock back on track. If you can, try to keep regular hours at work as well. I know you are working hard right now, but try to keep the overtime to a minimum. Also, try to eat lunch outside or get outside at some point during the day. Getting enough daylight is yet another way to help regulate your body clock."}, {"instruction": "These seem like such small steps: some sunlight, a schedule, no overtime, regular sleep.", "input": "", "output": "Yet together, they can have a very large overall effect."}, {"instruction": "I'm finding all of this very interesting! I might spend some time on the Internet, researching stress management.", "input": "", "output": "You'll learn all my secrets!"}, {"instruction": "Ah ha! I've found you out!", "input": "", "output": "The Internet is a wealth of information; I highly recommend that you do a bit of stress-free surfing as long as you get some time outside in the fresh air."}, {"instruction": "I'll do my best, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Getting your body clock on track will help reduce your stress, but it's not the whole answer. You need to give your body time to heal and regenerate. You have mentioned anxiety, great fatigue, and an overall lack of enjoyment with your life. You need to allow your body time to regenerate its happy messengers."}, {"instruction": "Happy messengers? Doctor Balis, have you gone off the deep end?", "input": "", "output": "No, no. Your brain creates trillions of messages a day; some are happy, some are sad. The happy ones are known as endorphins. Stress disrupts the delivery of happy messages. If the stress continues or increases, the happy messages may fail completely. This means that the nerve centers will only receive sad messages, causing the brain to become distressed and pain thresholds to lower. This chemical imbalance is often caused by overstress."}, {"instruction": "Am I overstressed?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I think you are overstressed. But we can work on that by getting your body clock back to normal, keeping your blood sugar steady, and dealing with the problems that contribute to your daily stress. I can teach you some relaxation techniques, but the most progress can be made by simply changing your frame of reference, learning how to deal with stressful situations, and dealing with the causes of your stress."}, {"instruction": "What are some of the relaxation techniques?", "input": "", "output": "There are different techniques to deal with long-term and short-term stress. Because you are feeling so much immediate stress, I'll show you the short-term stress techniques. These will help you deal with the adrenaline rushes and the tenseness in your muscles."}, {"instruction": "All right.", "input": "", "output": "One of best relaxation techniques is exercise. Exercise gets your blood flowing, which circulates more oxygen to your brain. Exercise also produces endorphins, which give you a feeling of happiness and well being."}, {"instruction": "Next, you're going to tell me to count to ten before I do things, right?", "input": "", "output": "In a way, yes. Taking ten deep breaths and feeling each breath fill you up and exit is very relaxing. When combined with relaxing imagery, this concentrated breathing exercise can be very effective. Would you like to try it right now?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Am I supposed to think of my grandmother baking bread?", "input": "", "output": "If that will help you relax. Or you can think of being someplace pleasant and relaxing like laying on a beach with a warm sun above you and the surf beating on the shore, maybe some seagulls flying overhead..."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'm there.", "input": "", "output": "Close your eyes. Picture yourself on this beach. The warm sun is shining and toasting your skin. A gentle breeze flutters through your hair. Now slowly breathe in as I count to five, then exhale as I count from five to ten. One, two, three, four, five. Exhale. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Good, let's do it again. Inhale. One, two, three, four, five. Exhale. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten."}, {"instruction": "This is nice. I can get used to this.", "input": "", "output": "You should try to spend at least twenty minutes a day doing this. Okay? What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I feel a little overwhelmed. I've learned a lot.", "input": "", "output": "Good. You need to understand what is happening to you when you feel stressed so you can fight it better."}, {"instruction": "I'll probably do some research on stress and stress management over the weekend. Once I do a little research, I'm sure all of this will come together for me. I feel better armed already. I'm prepared to fight off stress and enjoy life.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "I do appreciate your help. Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I'll work on regulating my schedule. Look, our hour's up.  See, I'm getting on schedule already.  It seems that getting my body clock back on track will help alleviate some of the tension I've been feeling. Aside from that, it just makes me feel good to be organized. I wonder what Jesse is going to think of all of this. We were discussing \"quiet time\" for children as a discipline, but it looks like I'll be the one getting \"quiet time.\"", "input": "", "output": "Everyone can benefit from a little quiet time."}, {"instruction": "Thanks again, Doctor Balis. I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Have a good week, Madeline."}, {"instruction": "Yes, much better. Thank you. But I've been so tired lately. I think my immune system is down--I feel like I'm susceptible to just about any illness floating around. But quite a few people at work are out sick, too. Hopefully, it won't turn into an epidemic. Anyway, a few days of rest and relaxation were just what the doctor ordered, as it were. Jesse babied me while I was sick. He is such a sweetheart. He literally waited on me, hand and foot. I felt a little guilty, but not too guilty to enjoy the respite.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes, rest is the best prescription. I'm glad to see you back at work and back in therapy. I was concerned that you were possibly avoiding our sessions, hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I suppose I should feign shock, surprise, and indignation, but I think lying to you would be counter-productive.", "input": "", "output": "I agree. Honest and open communication is an integral part of therapy. I appreciate your candor. Why don't we start with the trial? How did it go?"}, {"instruction": "Somehow, I knew you were going to bring that up. It didn't go. Friday morning, I went to the courthouse as scheduled. I waited for about an hour, when Clarice, my attorney, came out and told me that the defense attorney pled down the charges. Instead of three counts of rape and one count of second degree murder, he is charged with manslaughter and two counts of sexual battery.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What do you think of the plea?"}, {"instruction": "On one hand, I'm relieved that I didn't have to testify. I'm glad that he's going to jail. But somehow, I just don't feel vindicated.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think he's getting off lightly?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I would rather have a guarantee that he's going to jail, than bank on the prosecution's ability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the perpetrator. I like knowing that he'll be locked up and that he's now a convicted sex offender. Maybe now, he'll find out what it's like to be violated. He has enough of a pretty-boy look that he's sure to become someone's girlfriend. I think the real justice will happen once the cons get hold of him. I hope they'll initiate him slowly.", "input": "", "output": "An eye for an eye, as it were?"}, {"instruction": "Yes! He has no idea what it's like to lay awake in bed at night, terrified of every sound, not knowing if it's safe to close your eyes and sleep, not knowing if some sick disease has been passed on to you by force. He doesn't know what it's like to be dehumanized, to be treated like a piece of meat, to be pummeled for someone else's sick pleasure! The fear and terror that becomes intrinsic to your every breath...maybe he'd start to understand what he's done when he becomes someone else's property--when he gets probed and forced to submit to someone's inhumane acts. I hate that man! Doctor Balis, see this scar?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "He did this to me. He branded me. He held me in a choke-hold and cut me, while telling me that I was his bitch. He said that he was branding me and that I would always be his bitch to use however he wanted. He threw me onto the floor, onto all fours, and kicked me in the ribs. Then he grabbed me by my hair and dragged me across the floor to the kitchen. I tried to fight him, so he threw my head against the kitchen wall, and I crumpled to the floor. While I was out of it....", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Madeline. Take your time. Try to control your breathing."}, {"instruction": "I need to get this all out now, or I'll lose my courage.", "input": "", "output": "Use your anger to force the story out, Madeline."}, {"instruction": "While I was slumped on the floor, he trashed my kitchen--plates, glasses, mugs were all crashed around me on the floor. He emptied all the drawers, dumping them on top of me. He took just about every dark colored substance in that kitchen and rubbed it into the wound. The police said that he'd used everything from pepper to soy sauce. Sick bastard! So, not only do I have a scar, but it's a tattoo as well. When I woke up, he was...he was...", "input": "", "output": "Madeline. You're safe here. He can't hurt you anymore. Take your time. Breathe. That's good."}, {"instruction": "When I woke up, he was...I'm so humiliated.", "input": "", "output": "Breathe, Madeline. It's all right. Try to breathe. That's it."}, {"instruction": "When I started to wake up...I remember waking up to such intense pain. My vaginal area felt like it was on fire. My head was throbbing. I felt like I had been put inside a trash can and rolled down a hill. My eyesight was so blurred that I wasn't even sure what was going on. The room was spinning. Opening my eyes a crack sent lightening bolts through my head. As my eyes started to adjust, I could tell that he was sort of standing over me. My sight started to clear, and I was horrified with what I saw. I started screaming and trying to scurry away from him as fast as I could. He was...he was squatting over me and...he was...he was defecating on my stomach! I started screaming. He grabbed my hair and snapped me upright. He held my face over the stove and told me that if I didn't shut up, he'd turn on the burner. I must have passed out just as he turned on the gas--I remember feeling the heat, but then nothing. I woke up on my bed as he was anally raping me, and then nothing again. Later, I woke up in the hospital and went nuts. Everything after that is so fuzzy.", "input": "", "output": "Madeline..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, this is the first time I've told anyone what really happened to me. The police guessed most of it because of the shape I was in when they found me. Even Jesse doesn't know about some of the sickest parts of what happened. In the hospital, they explained to me the extent of my injuries. I had a concussion, bruised ribs, slight internal bruising, bleeding in my rectum, and...they told me that he had used a cigarette and burned my labia with it, and up inside and around my clitoris. As the doctor continued talking and telling me the ways he had abused me vaginally, I felt ill. I was so afraid to ask, but I had to know if I could still have children. They said it was highly unlikely. I think that was the hardest thing for me to hear. I felt as though my soul had been sucked out of me. There is more, but I just don't have the strength to say anymore. Now do you understand why I hope he suffers? Can you understand why I want him to feel the same pain and humiliation that he pushed on me?", "input": "", "output": "I do, Madeline. I understood before you told me the details of your rape, but I understand better now that I've heard you. Do you have flashbacks of the rape?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Doctor Balis, sometimes I just want to claw my eyes out. Yesterday, when I walked out of the ladies restroom at work and turned a corner, I almost collided with Scott--he's a man I work with. I freaked out and started screaming and trying to scramble away from him. He grabbed me to keep me from falling, and I just started hitting him. He held me tight and kept telling me that it was okay, and that he was Scott, and that he was safe. I just started sobbing. I was mortified. He helped me walk into a conference room and sat with me until I had calmed down a bit. I felt so terrible about it. He must think I'm a complete freak.", "input": "", "output": "Does Scott resemble your attacker in any way?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't expect to see anyone when I turned that corner, and then he was there. I freaked. I saw a man, coming towards me, invading my personal space and...and I just wigged out. Please lock me up, Doctor Balis. I'm a menace to society.", "input": "", "output": "Madeline, you were attacked in your home--your safe place. Someone got into your safety zone and violated you. When you ran into Scott, it triggered memories of the rape and you had a fear reaction. For a while, you're going to continue to experience events that will remind you of your attack almost daily, although perhaps not all events will trigger such a strong response."}, {"instruction": "I went through all of this right after the rape. I was a basket case. Just hearing Jesse light the stove would make me break into a sweat. Why is it all coming back?", "input": "", "output": "Possibly because of the trial..."}, {"instruction": "And? I hear an \"and\" in your voice, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I think it's possible that you have avoided dealing with your fears and emotions that resulted from the rape. With the trial, all that you have suppressed has resurfaced--you've got the fears, flashbacks, acute distress, nightmares, and anxiety again. Tell me, Madeline, do you sometimes see things that you know are not there?"}, {"instruction": "What? How did you know?", "input": "", "output": "What do you see?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, the stove lights itself. Sometimes, I feel the scar on my breast bleeding, but when I touch it, nothing has changed. I thought I was going insane. How did you...", "input": "", "output": "Rest assured, you are not. You are dealing with the after-effects of a very traumatic and stressful event. Sometimes, hallucinations happen. How frequently do these hallucinations occur?"}, {"instruction": "It's happened about half a dozen times since I started therapy.", "input": "", "output": "Would you say they are happening more or less often now?"}, {"instruction": "It's only been six or seven times...I really don't know. Why? Is something wrong?", "input": "", "output": "No, I'm just trying to gauge the frequency of occurrences. I'd like you to tell me each time it happens. You can just drop a quick e-mail if that's easiest for you. I want to keep track of this. I know how frustrating and disconcerting it can be. If the hallucinations continue or progress, we'll consider medication to suppress them, all right?"}, {"instruction": "Are you sure I don't need to be committed?", "input": "", "output": "I'm positive. I'm sorry if I alarmed you; that was not my intent.  But I know hallucinations can be very scary, they can make you doubt yourself. Now that I know about them, I can help you deal with them and make them stop."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis. I'm sorry I was such a wreck today. I'll try to be a bit more cheerful next week.", "input": "", "output": "You showed a great deal of strength today, Madeline. It took a lot of courage to to tell me what happened, to say all those things out loud."}, {"instruction": "It did.", "input": "", "output": "And please, it's not necessary to show me a happy side when you're here. Just be honest."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Have a good week, Madeline. And feel free to contact me any time you need to."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Madeline."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "It's good to see you, Madeline. Are you all right? You look as though you've been crying."}, {"instruction": "Normally, I'm not a weepy person, but sometimes, I just start crying for no reason. I thought that I was past the rape, I really did. But it's back again. All the fear and distrust...I can't even remember the last time my husband and I made love. It's such a clich\u00e9 to say: \"Give it time\" or \"These things take time.\" I don't want to give it time; I want to be better now!", "input": "", "output": "Do you need some more tissues?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, thank you. Doctor Balis, when will I feel safe again? When will I be able to touch people and let them touch me without jumping? When will all this anger go away?", "input": "", "output": "I know you don't want to be told to work on it and give it time, Madeline, but it's the truth. There is no quick fix for your trauma. Every day, it will hurt a little less..."}, {"instruction": "It sure doesn't seem that way. I feel like every morning, I wake up a little more angry and hateful. Jesse and I are hardly speaking because all I do is snap at him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Well, you know that acting out doesn't solve the problem..."}, {"instruction": "No, but it makes me feel better.", "input": "", "output": "Does it?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I feel the anger instead of letting it sit inside of me and simmer. As I blow up at Jesse, I feel like I let out a little of my fury.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "How do you do that?", "input": "", "output": "Pardon?"}, {"instruction": "How do you see inside me, Doctor Balis? I tell you that letting out my anger makes me feel better, but you know it's not true. Somehow, you know that I'm just fighting to keep my sanity.", "input": "", "output": "Your anger is definitely justified. I'm concerned about the ways you are allowing it to manifest. But I'm glad that you are able to recognize that you're not being fair to Jesse."}, {"instruction": "Yes, poor Jesse. It must be horrid to live with such an irrational bitch like me. But Jesse has plenty of friends, Doctor Balis. He doesn't need you on his side as well.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't realize that sides were being drawn."}, {"instruction": "Never mind. I can't believe that I'm baiting you and trying to pick a fight with you, too. I feel like I'm going crazy. And I've been like this at work, too. Sammy is just about the only person who understands me and can deal with me when I'm like this. She and I have been friends for what seems like forever. You know, I was reading an astrology site on the Internet--it's not that I believe all that stuff--and it was saying that Gemini's deal with stress best by talking about it. I know I feel a lot better after our sessions, but I also feel better about my problems when I talk about them. The problem doesn't seem quite so bad after I've told it to a few friends.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes, airing the problems helps to vent the feelings."}, {"instruction": "Sammy is coming out to visit for a week. I'm hoping to be over this darn sinus infection by the time she gets here. I hate being sick. Lately, it's all I can do to get out of bed and go to work. I feel like crap all the time.", "input": "", "output": "Have you seen a doctor?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I'm on some mega-decongestants and some other stuff. I had to quit nursing Natalie. The doctor said it was too much of a pull on my body's resources. I cried when he told me that. I really wanted to try to nurse her until she was at least six months old. I know most working women nowadays try to dry up as soon as they go back to work, but I wanted to give my daughter as much natural sustenance as possible.", "input": "", "output": "But if you have an infection and are taking antibiotics, it's probably a good idea not to nurse--it will give your body a chance to recover, and it won't pass chemicals into your daughter's system. But I can understand how hard it must be for you to give up this connection to Natalie."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I feel as though I've let her down. I'm sure I'm over-dramatizing the whole thing.", "input": "", "output": "How are you and Jesse communicating? Do you talk to him about these concerns?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's a change of topic.", "input": "", "output": "You don't mention Jesse very often, and when you do, it's usually in a negative connotation."}, {"instruction": "Jesse. Well, Jesse and I are like old roommates but with special niceties tossed in for variety. When Jesse and I met, I fell head over heels in love with him. He was so cavalier, slightly arrogant, and ever so charming. His smile could warm my heart on the coldest day in February. I got pregnant, so we got married. I'm sure we would have married eventually even if I hadn't gotten pregnant. We were so in love. With our love child on the way, we felt like the world was our oyster.", "input": "", "output": "You're smiling. Those must have been happy times for you both."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes. Even though our parents were trying to rip us apart, we felt invincible. We were in a terrible car accident and lost our child, but even that didn't damage our bond. I know Jesse remembers how close we were after we lost the baby. We were both devastated. My parents said that we were being punished for sinning--for having sex outside of marriage. Jesse and I just tuned them out as best we could and continued supporting each other. As we healed, I guess we began to slowly move apart.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm, I think I grew up and he didn't.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "I have nothing against Jesse's fascination with his scooter. I think it's a great hobby.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "But I think he treats it like a high school obsession, rather than an adult hobby. He really does obsess about his scooter and his scooter buddies. Sometimes, it's to the point of ignoring his responsibilities. He thinks nothing of being late to work or changing his schedule at the last minute to accommodate his scooter pals. Part of the reason he chose to work at the bookstore was so he could take off whenever he wanted to tool around on his scooter. For a while, I wasn't sure why it bothered me so much. But after I really sat down and thought about it, I realized that he's afraid of responsibility. Working as a book clerk isn't really a glamorous job. Most people would consider it a high school job. Jesse is intelligent and creative; he can do anything he wants. And yet...", "input": "", "output": "What he wants is to work at a bookstore?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. He wants to work at a bookstore. Working at a bookstore is no big deal. It's the reasons for it that bother me. I hate to sound so petty, but I feel like the more I excel, the higher salaries I get, the less he wants to work. Mr. Mom is cute, but only for so long. Anyway, I seem to have run down a rabbit trail here.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay. I think it's productive."}, {"instruction": "Well, to continue the Trent saga, we just kept living day to day. We weren't fighting, but we weren't growing closer to each other either. After a while, I started really hearing my parent's complaints about Jesse. I really heard what they were saying, and some of it started to make sense. I found myself wishing he was more of a take-charge man, that he would deal with the day-to-day facets of running a household--like paying the bills and managing the budget. I wasn't unhappy, mind you, just a little miffed, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Then, I met Travis. Travis and I worked for the same company but in different departments. He was about thirty years old when I met him. He really impressed me with his command of the English language. He was very articulate and had a large vocabulary. It sounds funny to say that I was impressed with his use of a dictionary and thesaurus, but he exuded intelligence and decorum. Boldness and grace floated around him like a woman's perfume lingers around her. Travis was definitely a take-charge man. He was aggressive, but not obnoxiously so. When he saw what he wanted, he assessed it, weighed the pros and cons, then made it his. It didn't matter if it was a new policy he wanted put in place, or a new car, a lunch, a piece of real estate, or...or a woman.", "input": "", "output": "Were you and Travis..."}, {"instruction": "I was attracted to him. Very much so. So much that it scared me. And he made no effort to hide his interest in me. He pursued me shamelessly. He was never crass, or obscene, or demanding. He just made sure that I knew that he found me attractive, demure, and, to quote him, \"the epitome of femininity.\" I was flattered, giddy, scared, and tempted all at once.", "input": "", "output": "Did he know you were married?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes. I told him many times that I was married and very much in love with my husband. But he said that the way I blushed when he complimented me told him everything he needed to know.", "input": "", "output": "Did this cause problems for you at work?"}, {"instruction": "No, he was very discrete. I'm sure there were a few whispers, but there was nothing to substantiate anything other than speculation.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I didn't sleep with him, Doctor Balis. I'll admit that I was tempted, but I couldn't do that to Jesse or to our marriage. Once I realized that I was on a quick road to divorce court, I put out my resume and landed a job at SII. For better or for worse, I was on the fast track out of St. Louis.", "input": "", "output": "Does Jesse know about this?"}, {"instruction": "Oh God, no! Even though I never cheated on him, he'd be broken hearted and demoralized to know that someone else almost stole me away from him. I couldn't hurt him like that. Jesse loves me so much, but he just doesn't know how to love me. Maybe I'm too fickle or too hard to live with. Jesse and I may not have as much in common now as we did when we first met, but we do value each other and love each other. I know that we can overcome our problems and will end up stronger in the long run. I don't want to be another couple who hits some bumps and just gives up. That's not what marriage is about. Too many people get married and then give it up at the first sign of trouble. I've invested so much in Jesse and in our marriage, and so has he. I won't let go of that.", "input": "", "output": "It's good to hear that."}, {"instruction": "I'm glad you understand, Doctor Balis. My parents sure don't. Hmm. It's getting late, Doctor. Why don't we go ahead and end the session now? We can talk more about my parents next week, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Will you be here next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I'm sorry I've been so lax about making it to my sessions. I've been so scatter brained lately. I always mean to call you and tell you when I can't make it, but I forget or get side tracked. But I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Have a good week, Madeline. Take care of yourself and drink plenty of liquids."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor. I've heard so much about you.", "input": "", "output": "All good, I hope. It's nice to meet you Ms. Mitchell."}, {"instruction": "Ha! \"Ms.,\" what a hoot!", "input": "", "output": "Well, Madeline, you're a bit late for your session today."}, {"instruction": "Sorry about that. Time seems to just slip me by when Sambo's here.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Let's get started then. Ms. Mitchell, would you mind waiting outside while Madeline and I talk?"}, {"instruction": "Oh God! Don't start that whole \"Cheech and Chong\" thing in front of my therapist!

Are you all right?"}, {"instruction": "Just peachy, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Bubba is my vibrator. I call it \"Bubba\" because he...uh, it has a lot of attachments and stuff. I really bought it on a lark to freak out Sammy.", "input": "", "output": "You don't have to explain Bubba, Madeline."}, {"instruction": "I know. But I feel kind of funny about her bringing it up.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think she did that?"}, {"instruction": "Because she's a nut. Because I'm a nut.", "input": "", "output": "Could it be that both of you are a bit under the influence. What is it, Madeline? Marijuana?"}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "Have you been smoking marijuana, Madeline?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, come on, Doctor. Don't tell me you never smoked a little weed to take the edge off.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And don't tell me that it's illegal, or that it kills brain cells--I could spare a few.", "input": "", "output": "I have to say I'm surprised.  This seems most unlike you, Madeline."}, {"instruction": "Is it against the law for me to loosen up every once in a while? I mean, really! I can be just as fun loving and carefree as the next pot head.", "input": "", "output": "Do you smoke marijuana often?"}, {"instruction": "No. Sammy brought it here as a special treat. We used to smoke pot together when we were in high school. We had some great times together then. Now, we hardly see each other anymore. I'm trying to convince her to move out here. I talked to this guy Vinnie at work, and he might be interested in hiring her...or just dating her--that's always a possibility. She really needs to settle down and get married. But why should she do that? She's seen what settling down has done for me. That ought to scare her away from men for good.", "input": "", "output": "Madeline, I don't..."}, {"instruction": "Most pricks don't.", "input": "", "output": "That was uncalled for."}, {"instruction": "Lighten up, Doctor B.

More for me, none for you!", "input": "", "output": "Madeline, I think you..."}, {"instruction": "You're really mad at me, aren't you?", "input": "", "output": "I'm concerned."}, {"instruction": "Oh, come on. I'm not a druggie, okay? It's just a couple joints to celebrate Sammy's arrival. I'm not growing the stuff.
