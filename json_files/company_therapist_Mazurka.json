I'm at a Giants game with the wife and kids. Everything's\nnormal, we're even having a good time. So I call over to the hot-dog guy,\n\"Four dogs over here!\" and he comes over to our seat, but he's\nall pissed off, I don't know why. He starts screaming at me. I start yelling\nback, everybody starts moving away, like in the movies when the hero and\nhis girl have their big dance. A couple of security guys come. They grab\nme and drag me off, but they aren't throwing me out, they're making me play.\nThey jam me into a jersey and push me out onto the field. The sun is beating\ndown into my eyes. I can hardly see. Then I almost trip over this chick,\nSuzy. You know that bimbo who works here? Everybody in marketing wants\nto get into her drawers. She's out there in the middle of left field on\na beach towel, wearing this thong thing--you know those bathing suits that\ndisappear up their ass-cracks. Anyway she's about busting out of this\nthing all over, and giving me this come-fuck-me smile, and I'm sort-of sleep-walking\nover her way with the crowd cheering when I hear the bat hit the ball, and\nit's coming my way. I don't have a glove, but it's coming real slow, but\nI'm in slow motion too, and I make this great catch, you know, jumping way\nup in the air. But the ball sort of comes apart in my hands like a rotten\ntomato, and I'm holding these pieces of it and blood keeps pouring out of\nits cracked skin, and I can't put it down, it's stuck to my hands. This\nis where I woke up. What do you think it means? Anything?", "input": "", "output": "Do you think it means something?"}, {"instruction": "Nah, not really. It was what it was. I just wish the\npitcher had warmed up a little more, then I could tell Suzy I had a wet\ndream about her. She'd like that, I bet.", "input": "", "output": "I think that might constitute sexual harassment. It's\nokay to talk about it with me, but if you talk about it with her, you\ncould be fired pretty quickly."}, {"instruction": "They wouldn't dare. Nobody messes with Mazurka the Berserka.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you call yourself?"}, {"instruction": "That's what they called me at school. I'm a pretty nice\nguy most of the time, but I've got a hell of a temper. They found out quick\nenough. When I got real mad, I'd just lose it. There was this big\nkid--he was a lot bigger than me, anyway. He was always picking on me, teasing\nme, pushing me around. I forget what it was that finally set me off, but\nit was like my mind went red, and the next thing I knew a bunch of guys\nwere dragging me off him. I was on his chest with my hands around his neck,\nbanging his head against the blacktop. I guess I was trying to kill him--they\nhad to take him to the hospital. But he didn't give me any more shit\nafter that. He stayed out of my way real good. A lot of kids were afraid\nof me. That was okay--I liked having a rep. They never called me Berserka\nto my face but I didn't mind it, it sounds like a fighter's ring-name.", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Have you had any more of these episodes later in\nlife?"}, {"instruction": "Not too many. I guess the wife and kids know how\nto keep out of my way when I'm in a bad mood. I haven't really gone\noff on anybody for a long time. I just sort of keep it bottled up, you\nknow. But I think people know I'm not a guy to fuck with, right?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How did your parents react after that fight at school?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, when I came home all covered with blood my mom started\nto cry. I had to show her I was okay and that it was the other guy's blood\nthat had splashed on me. But my Dad was proud I won the fight, said\nI had the fighting Mazurka spirit. I guess I got it from him. He was\nalways slapping us kids around. I suppose it was to toughen us up. Mom got\nher share too. She got real tough. I never saw her so happy as when the\nold bastard finally croaked. She tried not to show it, but we could\ntell. Of course, I was out of the house by then, working and going to school.\nMy little brothers had an easy life, compared to me. Mom was real strict,\nbut she never got mean drunk.", "input": "", "output": "Like your father?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah. We could tell by the way his footsteps sounded\ncoming up the stairs. Sometimes he'd go into his and Mom's room and\nstay there. We'd make bets on whether it was going to be fucking or fighting.\nBut when he came into our room it was bad. He'd been in the army in Korea,\nand he'd line us up like soldiers, and all we could say was \"yes sir\"\nand \"no sir\"--\"sorry sir\" didn't cut it. So we'd have\nto stand at attention while he chewed us out about everything that was wrong\nwith us, and our Mom, and his job, and the whole fucking world, and then\nwe'd get punished for it, one at a time, like soldiers I guess. We'd have\nto drop our pajamas and grip the bedframe while he whaled away with his\nbelt. Then we had to say, \"Thank you sir\" or he'd start all over\nagain. But I gotta say, I respected him a lot more than my kids respect\nme, no matter what I do to them.", "input": "", "output": "Do you beat your children?"}, {"instruction": "Hardly at all. Nothing like what I got. But you can\njust take so much shit from a snot-nosed kid, you know? And sometimes\nthey just pick the wrong time to piss me off. Like last night, I was in\nthe middle of watching this important game, and the little bitch pushes\nthe button on the set and turns it off, just like that. And she had the\nnerve to hide the remote. Well, I tanned her little butt for her. Then\nshe goes crying to her mom, and the big bitch takes her side, so we have\na three-way fight going. Well hey, I'm not going to lose a fight to that\nfat pig and her little rooting section, I'm not that far gone. So then who\nshould show up but the boy with his baseball bat, no less. Well, I showed\nhim not to threaten his old man with a fucking bat. But I mean, what are\nthings coming to these days? A man can't even control his own wife and kids.", "input": "", "output": "Are you afraid of things getting out of control?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not afraid of nothing. No, I don't give a shit\nany more. She can have 'em both, they can all go to hell for all I care.", "input": "", "output": "What about losing control of yourself?"}, {"instruction": "It might feel good just to let go. I tell you, I'm getting\nclose. You can only push a guy so far before he snaps.", "input": "", "output": "Are you under a lot of pressure at work?"}, {"instruction": "No, just as long as I can keep beating my quota every\nyear, everything's just dandy. They say \"jump,\" all I can say\nis \"how high?\" but then they keep raising the bar. I don't how\nI'm supposed to do it, but maybe I'm not supposed to make it. Maybe they're\njust trying to get rid of me. I know some of those bastards hate my\nguts. Well, it's mutual. But I just keep doing my job, and feeling deader\nand deader. Well they better watch out, that's all. If a guy's dead already,\nif he's got nothing to lose, he can get very dangerous. And there's a few\nof them he might take with him when he goes.", "input": "", "output": "Do you ever fantasize about killing people?"}, {"instruction": "Who me? No I'm just talking through my hat. You\ndon't discuss this stuff with Personnel, do you?", "input": "", "output": "I told you, this is all strictly confidential. For the\ntherapeutic relationship to work, you have to be able to discuss the most\nforbidden things openly. In order to become a medical doctor I took the\nHippocratic oath promising to keep my patient's secrets. The burden on a\npsychiatrist is even higher than on a regular doctor."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, the hypocrite's oath, I've heard of it. Well,\nmake sure you keep it, I've sort of gotten to like you.", "input": "", "output": "I think our time is about up. You know, I think in addition\nto these sessions I'm going to prescribe for you a little medication.\nI'm going to give you a prescription to fill, and I'd like you to tell me\nhow it works, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Prozac, huh? Will it get me high?", "input": "", "output": "No, but it'll help you from going too low. Sometimes it\nis effective to take the edge off. Have you been keeping a journal like\nI asked you to?"}, {"instruction": "No, writing's not really my thing. I can't spell for\nshit. I always used to get bogged down staring at the blank page.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe you could just talk into a tape recorder, would\nthat be easier?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose I could give it a try. See ya next week.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I have an opening on Thursday at 2 pm.\nSince I've prescribed some medication, I'd like to see you a little early."}, {"instruction": "A lot better, Doc. I think that stuff you gave me\nreally works.", "input": "", "output": "You've been taking the medication regularly?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, the last couple of weeks.", "input": "", "output": "What changes have you noticed?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, lots of things. My body feels better, and I haven't\nbeen feeling so pissed-off at everyone. I guess I sounded like a real\nbastard at first, huh?.", "input": "", "output": "You don't have to worry about appearances here, Joe. Feel\nfree to blow off all the steam you want."}, {"instruction": "Okay, but right now I'm feeling fine. Amazing what a\nfew little pills will do. Oh, and I even have some doodles for you.\nYou said you were anxious to see some.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks, Joe. I'll take a look at them tonight. When did\nyou draw them?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, hell. I don't know. A couple of weeks ago. I found\nthem on my desk and thought you were the perfect guy to have them.", "input": "", "output": "I would like to have a look at them. And I'm glad you're\nfeeling better, but I don't want you to confuse the medication with a cure.\nIt is just something to make things go a little easier while you work on\nyourself."}, {"instruction": "You mean I got to keep coming back? You did a great\njob, Doc, but I've got other fish to fry. I mean, what's the problem?\nI'm a busy man. I'm carrying the load for the whole sales department, even\nif I don't get a lot of the credit. Right now, I should be knocking on doors\ninstead of farting around in here. No offense, but I've got a shitload of\nsoftware that's getting obsolete while we're sitting here shooting the shit--you've\ngot to move this stuff while it's fresh, or it starts to stink, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I appreciate that, but don't you think you'd be a more\neffective salesman if you got your own house in order?"}, {"instruction": "My house is doing fine, but if I don't pay the rent\nI get chucked out in the fucking street. The salary they pay me here's a\njoke--if I don't get commissions, I'm screwed. You know how much they get\nfor kids' sneakers these days? Whatever I bring in, it's gone the next day.\nI don't know, the harder I work, the more I fall behind.", "input": "", "output": "I think you will find it is well worth your while to complete\nyour therapy. It will take some time, but at the end of the day you will\nbe better off, I promise you."}, {"instruction": "So what are we supposed to do now? I told you, I'm feeling\nfine. I've even started working out again, getting back in shape. You get\nflabby sitting around all the time. How about you, Doc, you ever go to the\ngym? Maybe we could spar a few rounds.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you're out of my league. But I was thinking\nwe could try some sessions with your wife. She is covered under your\nplan, so it wouldn't cost you anything, and I think it could be very helpful."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know. A friend of mine went to couples counseling,\nand he ended up getting divorced. I can't afford that. We're barely making\nit as it is.", "input": "", "output": "Well I don't think it always happens that way. Sometimes\nit is possible to work things out. You might find yourselves communicating\nmuch more effectively."}, {"instruction": "I can communicate with her just fine. I bet she'd\nlike that--someone to help her bitch at me. You could take turns, like a\ntag-team. Sure sounds like fun, but no thanks.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry you feel that way. I've found that it helps\nto get the channels of communication going both ways. You don't need to\nfeel threatened. Sometimes just learning to listen to another person can\ncool things off. If the other person is listening, then you don't need to\nshout, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, maybe. I'll think about it, okay? But we've been\ndoing better, we've even been getting it on more. If you could get her\nto at least pretend she enjoyed it, maybe it would be worth it.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you want?"}, {"instruction": "It would beat \"Are you done yet?\" She should\ntake some whore lessons. They know how to treat a man.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still using prostitutes?"}, {"instruction": "Hey, it's part of my job. You think those buyers\nwant to spend the night looking at my face? Okay, some of them are fags,\nbut most of them want to get fixed up.

Have you been getting along with your co-workers?"}, {"instruction": "I've got to say, most of them couldn't sell cold beer\nin the fucking Sahara. But yeah, I'm doing okay with them. I go out and\nsell, they sit around with their thumbs up their butts looking for me to\nstep out of line so they can rat me out. They'd love to get rid of me. Then\nthere wouldn't be anybody around to show them up.", "input": "", "output": "Have they been complaining about you to their superiors?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing I can't handle. I think the company knows I'm\npulling my weight and then some. My boss isn't going to rock the boat, not\nwhen his bonus is tied to my performance. This guy's a lot smarter than\nthat cunt they brought in a couple years back--what a bitch. But she got\nthe message.", "input": "", "output": "What message?"}, {"instruction": "Don't fuck with Mazurka, that's the message. This\nsexual harrassment bullshit makes me sick.

But\nI'm still here and she's long gone.", "input": "", "output": "Who was this?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, Stephanie whatsis. This is ancient history, way\nbefore you got here. They brought her in to give us some \"diversity\",\nI guess. Comes out of some lezzy-feminist college, and she was supposed\nto tell me how to do my job. A real ball-breaker--you know the type. She\nmust have been been crazy to try it on with me. I don't let myself get pussy-whipped\nlike some of the wimps around here.", "input": "", "output": "So what did you do?"}, {"instruction": "Do? Oh nothing, really. Just kept being myself. Say,\nwhat does this have to do with my therapy? Like I said, she's out of here.\nI'm getting along fine. Anything else you want to know?", "input": "", "output": "This is for your benefit, not mine. Is there anything\nyou want to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "I'm doing great, I got no problems I can't deal with\nmyself.", "input": "", "output": "To be frank, Joe, it doesn't look that way to me. Even\nwith the medication, it seems like you are having a hard time keeping your\naggression under control."}, {"instruction": "You want me to lose my edge? What kind of salesman would\nI be without it? It's probably different for doctors, but out in the real\nworld you got to fight for every crummy nickel, or someone's going to take\nit away. You ever read a want-ad for a sales job? Aggressive. That's what\nthey say they want, every time. If you ain't got it, they'll throw you to\nthe wolves. I'm about as mellow now as I can afford to be. Any more and\nI'd probably get the boot.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you need to worry about that. A little bit\nmore empathy and concern for others would most likely be helpful in your\ncareer. Maybe some role-playing exercises..."}, {"instruction": "Aw, come on Doc, I don't have time to play games. Just\ngive me a clean bill of health and I'm done with this. The whole reason\nI've been coming at all is because my boss said I had to, and now he's cool.\nI did it, I got better, what more do you want?", "input": "", "output": "Like I said Joe, you've made some progress, but you've\ngot a long way to go. This is all totally voluntary. I can't make you continue\nif you don't want..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you can't. Well I've had enough. It's been\nswell and everything. I'd like to have time to wallow around in every miserable\nminute of my childhood, and figure out all my dreams and everything, but\nenough's enough. I've got to earn a living or I really got problems.", "input": "", "output": "Look, all I can do is make recommendations. I can't force\nyou to do anything. If you want me to write a note for your boss, I can\ndo that, but I can't tell him you are perfectly fine. I would strongly\nsuggest that you continue therapy, at least for a while."}, {"instruction": "Is that what you're going to tell him? Thanks a lot.\nBut I might have known that's what you'd say. You got your job to protect,\nsame as the rest.", "input": "", "output": "That really doesn't enter into it. But it is my professional\nopinion that you continue to need a lot of help, and I'm not going to lie\nabout it. You can come or not, it's up to you. Now the time's about up.\nIf you come back, we can talk some more."}, {"instruction": "Don't count on it, I'm a busy man. But thanks for\neverything, whatever it was. See ya one of these days.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Joe."}, {"instruction": "Hey, how's it going?", "input": "", "output": "Fairly well, how about you, Joe?"}, {"instruction": "Oh I'm great. Really great.", "input": "", "output": "Do you really mean that?"}, {"instruction": "Hey, I told you. Just look at me. I'm a new man.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to sit down, or lie on the couch?"}, {"instruction": "Fuck no! I got to move, got to keep going. Sit still\nand you freeze up. Lose it or use it. Got to fly or fry; I want to keep\nflying, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Well, whatever makes you feel more comfortable."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm comfortable, I'm great. You got to breathe,\nget that good spirit going, then you get strong. Can't you tell I'm a\nwhole different guy? I mean, I was messed up, you know. I was letting my\nbody just deteriorate; an athlete's body. It was a soft white wormy thing,\nwith aches and pains like an old man. It was weak...fucking pathetic.", "input": "", "output": "You do look somewhat different."}, {"instruction": "Fucking-A I'm different. You bet. You know I can bench-press\n200 pounds? And that's in less than a month. You ever see that old movie...what's\nit called? Here Comes Mr. Jordan or something. Anyway, it's about\nthis boxer who dies, right, but he's reborn into the body of this rich guy.\nI don't remember what happened to him, but anyway he sort of looks at himself\nand says \"I can get this body into shape.\" Makes the rich guy\ninto a prizefighter. Remember that one? It's sort of how I feel about\nthis guy Mazurka. Had a fine body but he let it go to shit.", "input": "", "output": "So you've been working out a lot?"}, {"instruction": "Fuck yeah, you don't get pecs like this...hey come on,\ncheck'em out...from shuffling papers, you know? Look at this bicep. See\nthat shadow there? Didn't used to be there a month ago. Want to arm- wrestle?", "input": "", "output": "Uh, no thanks. Say Joe, do you think you could stop pacing\naround so much and stay in one place? I think it would really be easier\nfor us to talk that way..."}, {"instruction": "I can talk while I'm walking, or standing, or sitting,\nor any goddamn thing I want. I'm not afraid of you. You can kiss my ass.", "input": "", "output": "Look, Mr. Mazurka, calm down, stop pacing, and show me\nsome respect."}, {"instruction": "Okay, sorry. I guess my mouth's been running away with\nme a little lately. No offense.", "input": "", "output": "So lately, have you often been feeling unusually agitated?"}, {"instruction": "How do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "Violent surges of emotion, mood swings, anything like\nthat?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Seems to me I've been enjoying things\nmore. Is that what you mean?", "input": "", "output": "What sort of things?"}, {"instruction": "Just little things. Like watching TV.", "input": "", "output": "Anything particular?"}, {"instruction": "It's just so beautiful, you know, like what they\ncan do. Like when this guy got shot, right? They go to slow motion, and\nyou know he's going to get it; then he slowly turns and you see the bullets\nripping through him, tearing out those big flames of blood through his back.\nOr when they cut off a guy's head, and you can see the stretched out ends\nof the arteries, and you can actually count the pulses as they squirt. With\nslow motion, the blood can just sort of hang there in space, making these\ngreat shapes in the air.", "input": "", "output": "Is that mostly what you watch?"}, {"instruction": "I watch all kinds of stuff. You can rent shit now you\nwouldn't believe. But not snuff films. That's all fake anyway.", "input": "", "output": "How does it make you feel to watch violent movies?"}, {"instruction": "Violent? What's the matter, you don't like action? You\nlike those movies where everybody sits around drinking tea and talking and\ntalking. I mean, if you like that shit, that's okay I guess, but I like\nit when something happens once in a while. Even the nature shows are better.\nI saw a lion rip up a gazelle just like that. It was gorgeous.", "input": "", "output": "Right. So you have generally been feeling better about\nthings?"}, {"instruction": "Except for things that piss me off. Maybe it's part\nof feeling stronger, but I'm through taking shit from people, you know?\nI took it and took it, but I've had it up to here and I'm through. I\nmean, if you're in good enough shape that you could take the average guy\nand rip his throat out with one hand, then you look at things a little different,\nright?", "input": "", "output": "Have you been getting into more conflicts with other people?"}, {"instruction": "No, I think I've been getting more respect. Just\nlooking people straight in the eye instead of looking away. Most people\nback down if I give'em the shiteye stare. Hardly anybody wants to start\nsomething with me. And if they did I'd finish it.", "input": "", "output": "Or they you. Look, I think we should probably discontinue\nthat medication I prescribed. There are such things as paradoxical effects--side\neffects that are very unusual and opposite from those we usually expect\nthe drug to have."}, {"instruction": "But why? That stuff really turned my head around, it\nsort of balanced out the other...", "input": "", "output": "What other?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing. I mean it balanced out my other side, you know,\nmy personality.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been taking any other drugs or medications\nbesides the one I prescribed? This could be really dangerous, Joe. I\nmean it. It's common for drugs that are perfectly harmless, or nearly, when\ntaken alone to have really terrible side effects when combined."}, {"instruction": "Uh no, they said this stuff was safe.", "input": "", "output": "What stuff?"}, {"instruction": "Well, you know, I'd been letting myself slide so long.\nI needed something to sort of jump-start my muscles growing again. And\nI've been feeling great, honest. But that stuff you gave me really helps.\nI don't know, it makes me feel happier. I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't\nfeel happy.", "input": "", "output": "So you're taking some kind of anabolic steroids?"}, {"instruction": "They call it \"a shot in the arm\" down at the\ngym. I don't really know what's in it, but it works good.", "input": "", "output": "Did you know those chemicals can seriously compromise\nyour system? They have been known to cause liver failure in otherwise healthy\nmen and that's not even getting into the psychological effects. And in combination\nwith Prozac, that's asking for trouble."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doc, I'll stop taking the shots, even though\nit's done me nothing but good so far. Just don't cut off the other, okay?\nBut I'm not going back to what I was before, got it? There's no way I'm\ngoing to be the miserable weakling that everybody dumps their shit on. Not\nme, no way.", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't say that was the impression you gave. But nobody\nis telling you to be weak. It's a strong man that takes charge of his life,\nand that's what I've been urging you to do. If you promise not to take\nany other drugs we can continue the Prozac, but you have to treat all\ndrugs with respect, or they will do more harm than good; believe me, I've\nseen what can happen and it's not pretty. So we'll see you again in a week?\nThat's August 19th at 4 pm."}, {"instruction": "I guess. Yeah. Okay, I'll see you then.", "input": "", "output": "And I have your promise on the drugs?"}, {"instruction": "Hi Doc. Sorry I missed the session last week.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you couldn't help it."}, {"instruction": "Oh, you heard what happened?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I got a call from the police."}, {"instruction": "Oh crap. Does anybody else know?", "input": "", "output": "I really couldn't say. What did you tell your boss?"}, {"instruction": "Carol called me in sick. I guess I was, sort of.", "input": "", "output": "That was nice of her, under the circumstances."}, {"instruction": "Why should she want me to lose my job? Even if she doesn't want to see me any more, the bitch still wants my money.", "input": "", "output": "It's hardly surprising that she should want some distance at this point. Do you want to get back together?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I'm not crazy about living in a hotel room, that's for sure. And it's expensive, too. We were barely making it as it was. I don't know how this is going to work.", "input": "", "output": "I was more interested in the emotional than the financial aspects of the situation. Are you sorry about what you did? Do you want her to forgive you?"}, {"instruction": "Sorry? Sure I'm sorry. We've had fights before, but I never lost control like that. I don't know what got into me. It was like, uh, temporary insanity. I couldn't help myself.", "input": "", "output": "Did you stop taking the steroids, like you promised?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I stopped. I guess rotting in jail for a few days gave me some time to think things over.", "input": "", "output": "But you didn't stop when you said you would. If you had, this whole thing might not have happened. And you're not going to start up again, right?"}, {"instruction": "I told you, I stopped. What the fuck do you want, a pledge signed in blood?", "input": "", "output": "It's no secret, the personality changes that those drugs cause. I'm sure Carol is going to want some assurance from you that you have quit them for good; that's if she's even interested in a reconciliation."}, {"instruction": "Do you think she is? Have you talked to her? I'm not even allowed near the bitch.", "input": "", "output": "Sorry, I haven't heard from her. You had better give her a little time. But if you have a message for her, I will see what I can do."}, {"instruction": "You know those counseling sessions you were talking about, the couples thing? Maybe we could do that.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure the restraining order would permit it, but if Carol would agree then it probably wouldn't be a violation. I could check, I suppose. But in the meantime you could get your own house in order."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, my house is in great order as long as I'm not around. Then everything goes to shit. Look, tell her I'm real sorry. I didn't mean to hit her that hard. I'd just been feeling so pent-up, like something had to blow. I'm sorry it had to be her that got it. She should have known not to fuck with me, the way I was. If I wanted a lesson in manners, I'd go to a fucking charm school. Who needs that kind of shit at home?", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you're still blaming her..."}, {"instruction": "No, no. Everything's my fault, it's always my fault. When in doubt, blame Mazurka, you can't go too far wrong.", "input": "", "output": "Come on, Joe; that's not very productive. And it's too easy, isn't it.  Look, just tell me what you want to do, and I'll try to help you do it. Do you want to get back together with your wife and kids or not? If you do, the first thing is to take responsibility for what you did, and take some steps to make sure it doesn't happen again. If not, then you just have to figure out how to live with yourself. Either way, you're going to need some help and that's what I'm here for. What's it to be?"}, {"instruction": "I want my wife and family back, if they'll have me. It's awfully fucking lonely in that hotel room, if you're used to having a family. There's really nothing else to do but hang out down in the bar, drinking with a bunch of other guys, then go upstairs and watch TV, or drink some more and puke your guts out. Whores are fun if you've got a lot of money to blow, but I could afford a quick hand-job maybe once a week. It's fucking depressing just to think about it. Carol took a lot of shit from me, I'll give her that. And I even miss the kids, worthless as they are.", "input": "", "output": "I would like to see you get your life back on track. How do you think I could help you to do that?"}, {"instruction": "You could loan me a few bucks until payday!  Just kidding. At least I've still got my credit cards. Otherwise I'd really be up shit creek. Yeah, talk to her, tell her I really love her, even though I'm a bastard. You know, the old soft soap. She's fallen for it before, the dumb cluck. But you're pretty smooth, you'll know what to say.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not going to tell her something I don't believe to be the truth. There's a difference between loving someone and missing the comforts of home, and I don't think you quite grasp the distinction."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, maybe I'll get so I miss her bitching. Then you'll know I've really lost it. I don't know, maybe behind every successful man there's a nagging bitch. At least I miss her coffee, that's a start. Do you think you could at least get me a visit with my kids? Not at the house. I'd take them to the zoo or something, see if they could tell who's meaner--their dad or that white alligator. I don't know what she's been filling their little heads with when they ask about their Dad, but I have a feeling it's a bunch of crap. I never thought I'd miss all that noise--it's amazing how much noise two kids can make, you'd think there was ten of them. Now that I can finally hear myself think, I don't like it as much as I thought I would. Maybe I should think happier thoughts.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see what I can do about the visit, but I'm not promising anything. It's just been a short time, and there's still a lot of calming down to do on both sides."}, {"instruction": "I'm calm. Don't I seem calm? What do you want, a fucking saint? Throw me in jail, tell me I can't go near my own fucking home and kids, give me a room in a seedy goddamn flophouse for forty bucks a night. I'll just eat it up, turn the other cheek and come begging for more. Come up smiling my big shit-eating grin.", "input": "", "output": "Look, nothing happened to you that wasn't your own fault. Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, maybe you could think about what you did wrong, and how you could avoid doing it in the future. I don't have any more time right now, but let's work out some more constructive strategies for next week, okay? And I'll try and call Carol, to see how she's feeling about things.  With any luck, she won't press charges, but there's no guarantee."}, {"instruction": "She'd better not start fucking with me! She can run, but she can't hide. I've had about all I can take already. It wouldn't take much.", "input": "", "output": "I really think you should come back earlier than next Monday.  Can you make it on Thursday?"}, {"instruction": "Gee, I'd love to oblige you, Doc.  But there's no way I'm going to come here more often than once a week.  I mean I'd love to spend more time with you and all, but there's just no way.  Forget it.", "input": "", "output": "Look, our next regular session is scheduled for Monday, September 2nd, but that's Labor Day.  But I want to see you in here on Tuesday, September 3, okay?  Is 10 am okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I can make it then.  Try to work something out with Carol in the meantime, and give me a call.  I'm at the Shangri-La Hotel in the Tenderloin.  I don't know the number off the top of my head.  But figure it out.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Joe.  And try to work on your attitude, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Attitude? What attitude?", "input": "", "output": "I just don't want you to get into any more trouble.  Feel free to give me a call if you feel like you're losing control again, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hi Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Hi Joe. How's it going?"}, {"instruction": "Not great. Did you talk to Carol about when I can come home?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I did speak with her briefly. I think you're going to have to give it some more time."}, {"instruction": "More time? How much fucking time does she need? I tried to call her myself, but there was something the matter with the phone.", "input": "", "output": "I think she might have changed the number.  She didn't seem very anxious for contact with you right now."}, {"instruction": "The bitch! She's trying to punish me, right? She should know better than that. So what did she have to say? What does she want from me anyway?", "input": "", "output": "I think she really wants some space right now.  You should keep away from her until she's feeling differently and you don't want to violate the Temporary Restraining Order, or you'll get in even more trouble."}, {"instruction": "That's not all I'm going to violate. Look, I've had about all I can take. How long am I supposed to go on like this? They're taking half my paycheck and the other half just barely pays for parking, shitty cafeteria food and rent on that fleatrap room. What kind of life is this?", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you tell me?"}, {"instruction": "What's to tell? Wake up looking at the beautiful view of a brick wall, go to work and act all bright and bushy-tailed so I can fool these jerks into buying our crappy, overpriced software--you gotta tell 'em it's going to just melt their troubles away, when really it's going to set them back months while they try to figure out how the fuck it works--but that's not my department, thank god. Wining 'em and dining 'em, that's the best part; at least I get to expense it if I've hooked a live one. But I don't know how much longer I can keep it up. Sometimes I'm really on the verge of telling them what I really think of their sorry asses. You got no idea what it takes out of a guy; selling is the hardest job in the world. And then to come back to that room...you wonder why the fuck you keep on doing it. I don't need a therapist, I need Dr. Kevorkian. But when I go, I'm taking some of those assholes with me!", "input": "", "output": "Are you really having suicidal thoughts?"}, {"instruction": "I wouldn't give 'em the satisfaction. A lot of those pricks can hardly wait, I can tell. No, don't worry, I'm just blowing off steam. Actually, I was really looking forward to this session. There's nobody I can talk to any more. I guess I don't really have any friends. Nobody I can lay this shit on, anyway.  You're just lucky I guess.", "input": "", "output": "It's part of my job. But what do you think would make your life better? What would you like to change about yourself? Maybe we could focus on that."}, {"instruction": "I'm fine, it's the rest of the fucking world that needs changing. But I'm too old to think I can do anything. I'm what I am, and the world's what it is. I guess I've just gotta make the best of it. Yeah, so what do I do but make a mess of things. I was doing okay and then I blew it. I didn't appreciate it at the time, but it seems pretty good compared to now. Well maybe if I end up in jail even this will seem like the good life. It's all relative, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "You could try and make the best of things, whatever the circumstances are. A lot of people have less than you do and still manage to be happy. What do you think their secret is?"}, {"instruction": "They're stupid, that's what. Maybe you could chop out a piece of my brain.  You shrinks still do that, right? I heard electro-shock is coming back too. Well, I'm not quite ready for it. Not quite yet, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Don't worry, I'm not a believer in that sort of thing, at least not except under some very particular circumstances. Gross interventions like that have been almost entirely superseded by modern drug therapies in any case. You've been continuing with the Prozac I prescribed?"}, {"instruction": "Nah, I didn't like the way it made me feel. I'm on a natural high, or maybe a natural low, whatever. But it's pure me, for what that's worth.", "input": "", "output": "And those shoulder pains you came in with originally, have they subsided?"}, {"instruction": "I get twinges now and then, but I think all that working out I was doing helped with that. Or maybe it was the shots. But the pains haven't come back since I quit.", "input": "", "output": "So you did quit the steroids, that's good to hear."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, tell Carol I'm my old loveable self again.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. But I'm not really in touch with her. She didn't give me her new phone number either. I assume she'll get in touch when she's ready to."}, {"instruction": "She'd better get ready damn quick. I can't live like this much longer.", "input": "", "output": "If you make yourself loveable, then you might be able to find somebody to love you again. It might be Carol, but then again it might not. All you can do is work on yourself and see if it makes a difference."}, {"instruction": "Just see if you can get her here, okay? I'll take care of the rest. It's easy for her to talk behind my back. I'd like to see what she says to my face. She's not so tough; I know her. She'll do what I tell her,  she always has. She can't hide from me forever, and the longer she takes the worse it's going to be.", "input": "", "output": "For her? I don't think this is the right approach at all. Try to concentrate on your loving thoughts, not the vengeful ones. I know you feel hurt, but so does she, and threats aren't going to bring her back."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, whatever works. She can only push me so far, you know?", "input": "", "output": "It seems like you were doing the pushing. She is still reacting to what you did to her. If she wants to forgive you and take you back, that's her prerogative. But she doesn't have to and you need to accept that."}, {"instruction": "I'll accept what I feel like accepting, okay? Don't you start with me! I do what the fuck I want, and nobody tells me what to do.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, come off it, Joe! Nobody's telling you what to do. I'm trying to help you face some basic facts so you don't have to get hostile with me. To be honest, it didn't seem to me that Carol had much if any interest in reconciling with you and, if you want to change her mind, your tactics are going to have to change radically. Don't shoot the messenger; I'm on your side, remember? I'll do what I can for you, but give me something to work with, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, okay.  Sorry. I guess I'm really pretty frazzed. You don't know what it's like, getting chucked out of your own home and having to live like a rat. Tactics, yeah, I can dig it. You catch more flies with honey than vinegar and all that. Of course, you catch even more with shit...", "input": "", "output": "Carol's not a fly. She's a human being who has already taken a lot from you. I didn't get the feeling she wanted to take much more."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but what about me? How much more am I supposed to take? Has anybody ever thought about that? A man can only be pushed so far before he snaps, and I'm getting real close, I'm telling you. Really fucking close.  Honest, I'm scared of what might happen if I'm pushed too far.", "input": "", "output": "People break up with their wives all the time, Joe. It's tough, but it's not the end of the world. Sometimes it's really for the best. I don't know why you need to feel that other people are pushing you into anything. Take on some responsibility yourself for a change. Why don't you try to make something good happen for yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Like what? I'm going downhill with no brakes. What the hell kind of good is going to happen to me?", "input": "", "output": "What about the bodybuilding, that had its positive side. Are you keeping up with that?"}, {"instruction": "I've had other things on my mind. I've sort of let it slide, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Don't you have any other interests or hobbies--anything to keep you busy besides work?"}, {"instruction": "Not really, I pretty much just sit around in my room, watch television, and reload.", "input": "", "output": "Reload?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you can save a few bucks, it's not hard to do. Heck, down at the range you can go through a box of cartridges in an hour, easy. That can add up.", "input": "", "output": "Now this sounds like an interest you've been developing. Do you practice shooting a lot?"}, {"instruction": "Well, whenever I can. Most of my guns are still at the house, but I've still got my car guns. You're allowed to carry them in a locked box, if they're not loaded and the ammo's in another locked box or something. Fucking useless, but don't get me started.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, we're about out of time, but I wanted to talk to you about the Prozac.  I really think we were seeing some improvement there until you started on the steroids.  You even said that you liked the way they made you feel.  Can't you start taking them again?  I really think they would help."}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it, okay Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I guess I can't ask for more than that.  So I'll see you next week on Monday, right?  That will be the 9th of September at 4 pm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, why not? See you then, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Joe.  Try not to get into any trouble."}, {"instruction": "Hey it's me again, ready to spill my guts. I've been saving\nup all week. I hope you're ready.", "input": "", "output": "Sure Joe, what's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I've really had a lot of time for thinking; my mind's a\nlot clearer now. I've thought of lots of stuff--like how I'm going to change\nmy life, kick butt on the job, get Carol and the kids back--it's going to\nbe great. Have you talked to her lately?", "input": "", "output": "Sorry. She hasn't called me and I don't have her new number."}, {"instruction": "Well I've got to talk to her. I've really been going through\nsome changes, you know. I'm ready to come home now. I know I can explain\nthings to her if she'd give me a chance.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you explain them to me? Then if I hear from her..."}, {"instruction": "I see the light! It's like I'm a new person. I've got a lot\nmore energy. It's like I was half-dead before, no wonder she couldn't stand\nhaving me around. Things are going to be different now, I swear it. Mind\nif I get up and walk around? I just can't stand it, sitting there like that.\nI got to be up and moving. Yeah, that's better. I tell you, I'm full of\nideas--I was telling my boss about some of them. We could reorganize this\nplace, shake out some of the dead wood that's cluttering up the place. We\nshould speed things up, too. Everything takes so goddamn long to happen\naround here. I don't know what those fucking nerds think they're doing;\nwe've been promising product for almost a year now and it's nowhere in sight.\nI've got some heavy customers that are about to jump ship. Maybe if we stood\nsome of those jerks up against a wall, it would be an example to the rest.\nWake up some of these guys and let them smell the coffee already.", "input": "", "output": "Okay Joe, but you don't need to bang on my desk. You mentioned\nsome insights into your own situation."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I've been thinking...I've had a ton of ideas. I guess I\njust needed to wake up and look around. A lot of what I was doing was just\nlaziness, just habit, just going through the motions. I was getting set\nin my ways like an old man, but I've got plenty of life in me now. I'm going\nto wake this place up too. That's what it needs, a little energy, a spark,\na live wire--that's me. I'm a mover and a shaker now.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, you do seem to be shaking a bit. Are you really feeling\nokay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay? I'm more than okay. As a matter of fact, it's me that\nshould be charging you for this. Pay attention, you might learn something.\nReally, I don't know why I'm wasting my time like this; I should be up and\nat 'em. I'm running my whole department pretty much single-handed, you know,\nor I could if they'd give me a chance. I do all the work as it is. But some\npeople, you just can't tell them anything. Like my boss. I pretty much laid\nthe whole thing out for him, it made perfect sense. I just don't know what's\nwrong with some people, they can't see their asses in front of their faces,\nor maybe they can't see the forest for the peckerwood. He just sort of said\nhe'd think it over.

It's just lately those fucking feminists have started making\nsuch a big fuss about it. And now that Hillary is president- shit, we might\nas well just chop 'em off and turn 'em in. When balls are outlawed, only\noutlaws will have balls, right? I swear, it's just a matter of time. I was\ntalking to some guys down at the range about it. I mean, what's next? You\nlet the government get in between a man and his own wife, and there's not\na lot more moving over left to do, you know? We got to get these fucking\nparasites off our backs, that's for sure. It wouldn't take but a few well-armed\nmen taking things into their own hands. Most people are like sheep, you\nknow, they'll go where they're led; it just takes a small group showing\nsome gumption and taking a stand to turn things around. I tell you, I'm\nabout ready. And there's a lot of guys that feel the same way. This society\nhas gotten soft, there's no way it can protect itself against a tight, determined,\ndisciplined army that strikes from within. Look at Oklahoma City. It could\nhave been here, no sweat, or anywhere, and how could the feds have done\ndiddley-squat? Look at Hitler. Started with just a few tough guys and ended\nup damn near taking over the world. Not that I agree with everything he\ndid, but he had some good ideas and he got stuff done. He really shook things\nup, that's for sure.

Well hey, pull my chain and I'll ring your bell, baby. Don't you\nforget it. I don't take shit from anybody anymore, and certainly not my\nown wife, and the sooner she gets that through her thick head the better\noff she's going to be. Where the fuck did she go, anyway? I went by the\nplace a couple of times and it looks like nobody's there. Either that or\nshe's hiding. It's not going to work, you can tell her that.

I guess I was just used\nto it and had a lot of time on my hands to do it in, and I started really\nputting on weight. So I got these diet pills, and they worked great. I didn't\nfeel like stuffing myself with food, and even when I had a lot to drink\nI didn't get that sleepy feeling. In fact, I hardly need to sleep at all\nlately.

Violence is being done to us every day, but nobody's doing anything about it. We're in the middle of a fucking war, we're being picked off one by one, but we can't shoot back. Well fuck that. I'm not going to go quietly. You think they're going to get my guns? We're talking cold dead fingers here, don't you forget it. Can't you see what's going on? We've been sold down the river. Clinton...Dole...they're all in on it together. The whole election thing, that's just for show. You ever hear of the Trilateral Commission? It's a bunch of guys who sit down at a table and decide what the whole fucking world is going to think, eat, wear; who's going to get killed.  They killed Kennedy because he wouldn't go along--he was a sitting duck; it wasn't a hard shot. But they're not getting me, no sir, no way. I remember Ruby Ridge; I've learned my lesson. I just hope they've learned theirs...", "input": "", "output": "Uh Joe, if I really thought you were planning to carry out some sort of violent act, it would be my duty to stop you, you know that don't you?"}, {"instruction": "Stop me?

You and what army?", "input": "", "output": "I can have you involuntarily committed for up to 72 hours if I feel you are so disturbed as to be a threat to yourself or others.

You think I'm going to say, \"Oh he did it for my own good--that's okay.  I forgive him?\" You think I'm an easygoing type of guy, you kick me in the ass I'm just going to turn the other cheek? Are you out of your mind?", "input": "", "output": "We aren't here to talk about me. In my professional opinion you are a very sick man and I have an obligation to see you get proper treatment.

It would of course be better if you went in voluntarily."}, {"instruction": "Sick? You think I'm sick in the head? Hey, I'm the sanest guy around here. Just because I come in here and talk some bullshit once a week, you think I'm really crazy? Jeez, can't you tell when a guy's stringing you along? I thought I was supposed to let myself go in here, say whatever came into my head and it was safe, just between us. And now you're talking about calling the cops? What kind of a deal is that?", "input": "", "output": "So now you're saying this was all an act? You're not really planning any violent actions?"}, {"instruction": "Fuck no, my mouth just gets going, you know? If you want, we can just talk about the weather--shit, I'm no goddamn lunatic. I thought you knew the difference. I was just blowing off some steam, shaking some of the demons loose, you know?  Sure I've had dark thoughts, but actual violence isn't my thing at all. Let's talk about football.  Can you believe the Panthers beat the Niners?", "input": "", "output": "We're not here to discuss superficial topics. This is serious business, at least it is for me.

Everything's going along great, then all of a sudden she's yelling rape. Well I don't need this. I thought you were somebody I could talk to that would understand what I'm going through, and maybe help me out a little; at least let me get some shit off my chest, but as soon as I tell you anything the least bit raw, you freak out like some little virgin. Sorry for the misunderstanding, but maybe we should call it quits right now. Don't worry, I'll be a good boy.", "input": "", "output": "If that's the way you feel about it, there's not too much I can do.

Relax Doc. You know I wouldn't hurt a fly, if it didn't get in my face...", "input": "", "output": "Maybe not, but you've seemed very irritable lately. Anyway here's the prescription, you can get it filled at the pharmacy down the block. And I want you to at least check in with me once a week. Do you think you can do that?"}, {"instruction": "Okay but no funny business right? I'm not checking into any nuthouse just because I make you nervous, you got that? And if you sic the cops on me, you'll be sorry. I mean it.", "input": "", "output": "No more threats okay? Look just get out of here before I change my mind."}, {"instruction": "But the time's not quite up yet. You think the Niners are going to get their passing game going before the end of the season?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know and I don't care. I said get out so just do it, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Now who's irritable? Well, see you around Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hi Doc.  You got my message about the change in the time, right?", "input": "", "output": "Hi Joe. What happened to you?"}, {"instruction": "You mean my eye? You should see the other guy.", "input": "", "output": "You got into a fight?"}, {"instruction": "I know what you're thinking, but it wasn't my fault.", "input": "", "output": "Really? How did it start?"}, {"instruction": "Well I was sitting at the bar, minding my own business; there's this place I go not far from where I'm staying in the Tenderloin, you know where that is?", "input": "", "output": "Not the best part of town, but anyway..."}, {"instruction": "Anyway I'm sitting there and this chick comes in, sits down next to me and orders a drink. So I pick up her tab, you know, and we get to talking--the usual sort of thing people talk about in bars: \"Come here often?\" and that kind of thing. I thought at first she's a working girl, a pro, but no, she just likes hanging out in places like that, catching a little atmosphere I guess. This place has got atmosphere, that's for sure; you can smell the can when you first walk in, but it sort of wears off after a while. But anyway, we're having our little chat when this guy comes up and grabs her shoulder from behind and says \"What are you doing in here? You're leaving right now.\" So I said, \"Wait a minute asshole, I was talking to this lady,\" and then I ask her if this man is annoying her. She doesn't say yes or no, but she looks scared and starts to run, with him after her. So I follow them outside and I ask this guy if he knows her and what right he has to come barging in like that, and--get this! It turns out he doesn't even know her fucking name. I guess he thinks she's some other chick. But he's still grabbing at her and I tell him to knock it off but he won't and she's starting to cry and all her makeup's running down her face. So I give him a shove and tell him to get lost, you know. And when I turn around to check out how the this girl is taking all this--like am I doing the right thing here?--he throws a sucker punch. I catch it in the eye when I turn around to see if he's split yet. So I let him have it. You should have seen him when I gave him a good shot in the guts. But he started it--I just finished up. He wasn't much of a fighter, really. He shouldn't have tried to take me on, that's for sure. Well it was all over pretty quick. Nobody even saw it, it was late and kind of dark. So I leave him there in the gutter--he looked like a lot of guys you see passed out around there, maybe with a little more blood and I turn around to Martha...", "input": "", "output": "Martha?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's the chick's name. Anyway, she's all trembly and white, I'm afraid she's going to faint or something, right? She doesn't say shit, just sort of stares at me through these eyes that are looking like the Grand Canyon by now, so I take her over to my place. It's right next door, what else can I do? I wash her face. That helps, she doesn't look half bad under that make-up.  So I get her a drink, she swallows the shit down like it's water. So I give her another one, but I've only got a half pint, there's one left for me. And then she starts to relax a little, still isn't talking, but she lies back on my bed and you know what?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Well you've heard of someone letting down their hair?  She's got her hair in this weird tight bun on the top of her head and it just unrolls.  Her hair is perfectly nice--she looks a lot better with her hair down--I mean a lot better, but you can't tell 'em anything, can you? But where was I? Oh yeah, she's lying there on my bed, just kind of staring at me--well what's a guy supposed to think? She lets me take off her shoes, so I take off her pants and panties too--just roll them down her legs.  She's not exactly helping but she's not objecting either, so I start to fuck her, it seems like the thing to do, right? But I've no sooner got it in, than she opens her eyes real wide and starts yelling and struggling. Well some chicks like it rough and I almost kept going, but all of a sudden I can tell she's really not into it anymore for some reason--it's like she's waking up from her dream or something and she doesn't know where she is or what's happening. Drugs maybe, who knows? But I'm the perfect gentleman, blue balls and all. No problem, whatever the lady wants. She grabs her pants, purse, and shoes and splits without her panties--no thanks or anything in spite of all I did for her. What the fuck, good looking but too weird in the head. Best piece of ass I've almost had in a month. At least I've still got her panties for a souvenir. With a good dog, maybe I could track her down--she never gave me her phone number. Yeah, aside from that little adventure, not a whole lot to report in the old love-life department.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds liked you raped that woman."}, {"instruction": "Raped her?  What the fuck?  Are you out of your mind?  Didn't you hear what I just told you?  I stopped fucking her when she said no.  There's no way you can call that rape.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like she was in shock and you started to have sex with her without her consent."}, {"instruction": "Man, I can tell you don't get laid much.  You think you ask each woman, \"Please Madam, may I fuck you now\" just before you dick her?  Get a life, faggot.  That's just not how the game is played.", "input": "", "output": "This was on Friday?"}, {"instruction": "No, it was Thursday night.", "input": "", "output": "Let's just change the subject here.  You have no idea what happened to your wife and kids, do you?"}, {"instruction": "No, what happened?", "input": "", "output": "Well they disappeared, you know that?"}, {"instruction": "I told you that weeks ago. You haven't heard from her either? I know she's kidnapped my kids. As soon as I can raise some money I'm going to hire some private dicks to go after her ass. She's fucking with the wrong Joe, that's all I can say. You been talking to the cops about this?", "input": "", "output": "They called last week. I told them if they had any questions they should ask them to you directly."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, they've been doing that. But I don't need you talking about me behind my back especially with the cops. I don't know what kind of a guy they think I am, but I don't need you telling them I'm some kind of a nutcase. That's all it would take. I just don't know where you get off with all that commitment crap. I'm the sanest guy around this place,  but I guess that's not saying a fuck of a lot. I swear, if I didn't have a few buddies whose heads are screwed on right, I'd really start to wonder.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been spending a lot of time with your friends from the shooting range?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, fair amount. I've set up a sweet little Remington rifle, a real beauty!  You should see it. I've got a scope on it that would blow your mind, with T-shaped crosshairs, so you get a great view. I can put a round in something as small as a quarter from a hundred yards away. Sometimes I sit in my room with the lights out, just looking at the world. It's amazing how many people don't draw their shades--you see some crazy shit going on.", "input": "", "output": "You look into people's windows through your rifle scope?"}, {"instruction": "What's the matter with that? I'm not sniping at them, I'm just watching, that's all. I'm sort of like Jimmy Stewart in that old Hitchcock film, where he's checking out his neighbors with his telephoto lens.  Maybe I'll see a crime being committed and be a hero like him.", "input": "", "output": "His camera lens wasn't on a rifle. I really don't think that's a good idea even if you are careful to make sure the gun isn't loaded and there isn't a bullet in the chamber.  Have you been taking the medication I prescribed?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, didn't you notice how calm and collected I am? I'm not going to shoot anybody--nobody that isn't fucking with me anyway.", "input": "", "output": "I'm telling you this for your own good. Don't you think the police can see you when you're doing this? You said they were asking you questions, don't you think they might be watching you too?"}, {"instruction": "Are you trying to make me paranoid? And I came here for a cure! Just kidding Doc. You're probably right though, thanks for the tip. A word to the wise and all that. I suppose I can use all the help I can get, but don't get in my way, that's all I've got to say.", "input": "", "output": "The time's about up. Are you coming back this time next week?"}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it. I really think I'm cured of most of the stuff I came in with. My shoulder got better, and I guess my family problems disappeared along with my family. So what's the point?", "input": "", "output": "People need to talk over their feelings with other people, in order to make sense of them. You are lucky enough to have a company-paid plan which pays me to do this with you. Who else would you share this stuff with, if it wasn't for me? Don't you feel the need to get things off your chest? I think you should stick with it, and maybe we can get your life on a more positive track okay?"}, {"instruction": "Well whatever. I don't see how this particularly helps but you're the doc...", "input": "", "output": "So I'll see you next week?"}, {"instruction": "I guess. Bye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Okay here I am. What fucked-up part of me are we going to fix today?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know Joe, is anything bothering you?"}, {"instruction": "My knuckles are still tender from a couple weeks ago, that fight I told you about. Not much else wrong with me.", "input": "", "output": "You don't feel guilty at all for what you did?"}, {"instruction": "I told you, it was self-defense. I was saving this lady from a guy who was bothering her--just like a hero in the movies--and the guy took a slug at me.  What was I supposed to do, kiss him?", "input": "", "output": "What about what happened after that?"}, {"instruction": "You mean with that spacy chick? What about it? Yeah I remember, you were calling it rape or something.  What a crock of shit--you don't have a clue. Not that I've got anything against it, I'm just a little old for that sort of thing.  I guess I just don't have the energy anymore.", "input": "", "output": "So you're not feeling any remorse at all for any of it?"}, {"instruction": "Look, I wouldn't have told you that story if I'd known you were going to go on like this. It was just one of those things that happen, okay? Why don't we just drop it?", "input": "", "output": "So you're feeling just fine about everything?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't say that. There's a lot of problems that bother me a lot.", "input": "", "output": "Like what for instance?"}, {"instruction": "Race-mixing, for one. It used to be a crime--it still should be--and now it's in your face wherever you go. And they're outbreeding us, four to one.  You do the math. It's an epidemic the way we're going.  Soon there won't be any white people left--everybody will just be different shades of brown. It's got to be stopped and soon. That and the goddamn faggots. It's disgusting, that's what it is. What with AIDS and all, there's a lot of places I can't even stand to eat in anymore. You can't go anywhere without seeing them flaunting it in the street. A lot of the so-called hookers around here are actually these freaky queer guys.  Sometimes they've even been nutted and had their units turned inside out or something to make fake cunts.  Imagine waking up with something like that in bed with you. I'd lose it for sure.", "input": "", "output": "You are worrying about inter-racial marriage and homosexuals? What does this have to do with you? I don't think you need to to search all that far for issues to try and deal with."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes you've got to step back and get the big picture. White men have to stand up for what's ours or it's all going to slip out from under us.  Don't think it won't.  Do you think those \"Afro-Americans\" want to be your pals? Dance on your grave's more like it. They hate us and we hate them.  The only question is who's going to win this race war that's started already. What about you, you got any guns in your house? How are you going to defend yourself when the time comes? You just going to ask them why they're feeling so aggressive and if they liked their mommies too much? They'll stick your head on a pole.", "input": "", "output": "I guess I've got better things to worry about. Are you sure you don't?"}, {"instruction": "What's the matter with you?  Don't you care what's happening to your race? Do you think for a moment those black kids on the street care two shits for all that liberal bullshit about how equal you want them to be? They'd kill you just for the fun of it and if they ever got caught, which is doubtful, they'd get away with it because they're disadvantaged and never got any opportunities.  Boo hoo hoo. You should join us before it's too late.", "input": "", "output": "That's you and who else? What are you planning to do?"}, {"instruction": "That's for me to know and you to read about when it happens. But we're talking front page, front page for days...", "input": "", "output": "If I really thought you were about to commit some sort of terrorist act, it would be my duty to stop you.  I've told you that. Aren't you worried about the police? Don't you think you've gotten into enough trouble already?"}, {"instruction": "If I ever thought you were going to the police...", "input": "", "output": "I'm not. And I'll tell you why. Because I know you're bluffing when you hint about some shadowy group of supporters and I think you just like to shoot off your mouth with all this tough talk. You're a pathetic loser trying to compensate for all that's missing in yourself, getting a sense of power by abusing the people around you. You know your life's going down the tubes and instead of trying to turn things around, you spin these paranoid fantasies. Frankly, you disgust me."}, {"instruction": "Are you feeling better now that you finally spit that out? Is this part of my therapy or yours?", "input": "", "output": "Does it matter?  I don't think it really matters. You don't seem to have any interest in changing and I've about given up on you myself. What did you expect, miracles? All I can do is help people to understand themselves a little better and hope that this understanding will help them recognize what they are doing wrong so they can make some positive changes. Most people want to be happy, to get along with other people, to avoid destructive behavior. It seems like you aren't interested in any of this.  You just want to indulge every evil impulse you have. I don't even want to listen to this shit anymore."}, {"instruction": "Ooh, you said \"shit.\"  Are you losing your cool? Is there anything I can do to help?", "input": "", "output": "You've done enough already. Does it make you feel good to upset people? Is that why you keep coming back, just to get on my nerves?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe that's part of it. I didn't think you were so thin-skinned though. I thought you shrinks had heard it all.  I'm no worse than some, maybe other guys just put on more of an act. You're just not used to people being honest with you, I guess. But I'm just a straight-forward type--I say what I'm thinking.  I thought that was what these sessions were supposed to be about.", "input": "", "output": "That's part of it, but not the whole thing. I know you're angry and depressed. I just don't understand why you feel the need to wallow in it like you do. I wish you'd at least take the medication I prescribed.  I think it would make a difference in your state of mind."}, {"instruction": "I'm angry and depressed for a lot of good reasons. What makes you think that a pill is going to make them all go away? That's what's the matter with this fucked-up country--if something's wrong, instead of fixing it, we just take some drug to make ourselves feel better about things. But if somebody wants to actually do something--whoa, he's an extremist--that might be dangerous, people might get hurt. Don't people realize that we're getting hurt already? But nobody listens, nobody cares. Everybody's too wrapped up in their job, or their family, or who knows what.  They like to talk but they never show up...", "input": "", "output": "Show up where? You're really trying to get other people involved in your delusions? That's not a positive thing to do. And you could really get in trouble--haven't you ever heard about conspiracy charges? Even if you never do any actual damage, just talking about doing it is against the law. We're talking major jail time.  Am I getting through to you?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe I've said too much already. Look can you do me a favor?", "input": "", "output": "I doubt it.  What do you want?"}, {"instruction": "Just hold off with your suspicions, okay? Maybe what we're planning to do isn't such a bad thing after all. I think you've got me all wrong.  You're building me up in your mind as some kind of devil or something, but I'm not like that.  I'm just an average Joe that wants to do the right thing for the long term. Trust me, it's all for the good. Anyway I've got to run.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Joe."}, {"instruction": "Wouldn't you like to know. Actually I have a few questions I want to ask you.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "Like how the fuck did those guys in Programming figure out that I was in the militia movement? You are the only person I've said anything to about any of that shit and you said it was confidential, right?", "input": "", "output": "Absolutely. I haven't shared the contents of these sessions with anybody, period. And I certainly never talked about you with anybody in Programming. Maybe one of your buddies from the gun range knows one of them and they got to talking about you."}, {"instruction": "I don't think so. You take notes during these sessions, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Where do you keep the notes?", "input": "", "output": "On this laptop computer which I keep with me."}, {"instruction": "Is it on a network or anything?", "input": "", "output": "No, it's totally secure. What exactly happened to make you feel it wasn't?"}, {"instruction": "It was weird. I hardly ever have anything to do with these guys, right? But I'd seen them around the company some. So I'm in the cafeteria and this tall guy with glasses buttonholes me and says \"We've had our eyes on you and we know you're a Patriot.\" And I say, \"So, what of it, is that a crime these days?\" And he says, \"It will be soon, if somebody doesn't do something about it.\" So I ask him what he's going to do and he says he's got a lot of good ideas but he can't talk about them right then. I guess him and some of the guys around here got to talking about how fucked-up this government is and what could be done. And somehow my name came up and I wanted to know--why me? But he wasn't sure, I'd have to come to this meeting to find out. So what the fuck, I met them in a booth in the back of a bar, and there wasn't anybody there I'd talked to about anything but maybe football. A couple were from the company, and there were three I'd never seen before including an Irishman, of all things. Some kind of expert, I guess. When I asked them how they'd heard about me, they got real vague on me, just sort of hinted about walls having ears and that kind of crap. They did show me some cool spy equipment, I'll say that. I knew you can get this stuff over the counter now, but this was the pro stuff. I've always wanted a night vision scope myself and the one they showed me left the ones I've tried in the dust. They had a listening laser too--you can just point it at a window and hear what's being said. We tried it outside the bar. Maybe they bugged you with that.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think so. I'm not saying that there aren't lots of ways people can find personal information, especially if they are good with computers. Why do you think they were interested in you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure. But they seemed to have a lot of savvy. They were into a lot of high-tech ways to bring the country to its knees, if you know what I mean. There isn't much that doesn't rely on computers anymore, if you think about it, and these guys are pros--they can hack in anywhere. Yeah, and if they find out I've told you this much about them, at least we'll know where the leak is coming from. That's when you find me dead.", "input": "", "output": "You wouldn't be getting a little bit paranoid now? Seen too many suspense dramas? You don't need to have anything to do with these people and I suggest you don't. Maybe we should focus on the real issues in your life and not get carried away into Fantasyland."}, {"instruction": "What real issues? I'm living in a total vacuum these days, didn't you know that? These guys are right on my wavelength and I think I'm going to hang with them a while, if only to see if they can walk the walk, not just talk the talk. I wish I knew what the fuck they wanted with me is all. Especially the Irishman, I can't suss him out at all. I mean a native-born American has a certain stake in how things come out, but this guy--I can't figure his angle. A lot of Micks are just down on the whole system, maybe he's one of them, lumping us in with the Brits. But hey, I'll go along for the ride, what have I got to lose?", "input": "", "output": "Your life, for one thing. Should I consider this a cry for help? Are you signing up to be some kind of suicide bomber? What do you think these guys want you for, your savoir-faire?"}, {"instruction": "Well, they've got the smarts, maybe they don't have the balls. Maybe they just like my style.", "input": "", "output": "If they really had been listening to our sessions--I really don't think they did, but just suppose--they would have heard a man gradually deteriorate, losing his wife and children through his own brutality, getting into drugs, guns, and sexual assault, fantasizing about race war and militias; a man who is on a swift downhill trajectory and seems ready to do some kind of violent act--what do you think they might want with a man like that? Come on Joe, at least you're not stupid; use what's left of your brain and tell me."}, {"instruction": "I don't know Doc, maybe we'll just have to see how it works out. There's just so much one man alone can do. But I shouldn't be shooting off my mouth about this shit--and you never heard it, right?", "input": "", "output": "Like I said, everything you tell me is strictly confidential. But you're really pushing the envelope here. We're supposed to be talking about you and your personal problems, not the crimes you plan to commit. I wish we could get back on track."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, my personal problems. My main personal problem is being horny. The bitches in this town are unreal; try to strike up a conversation with a woman and it's like you're Jack the Ripper. I can't tell you how many have gone into their Kung Fu stance when I came over and said hello. I think they can smell desperation and if no other woman's got me, they don't want me; there must be something wrong with me. Like that gorgeous weird chick I told you about--I saw her again: at work as a matter of fact. She looked at me and just kept going, stone-faced. Not even a \"Hi Joe,\" not to mention thanks or anything. And I really put myself out for her. It just goes to show... I wonder if she works at SII?  Somebody should teach her better manners. But anyway, I guess you're not going to help me with that one...", "input": "", "output": "You're a fine one to be talking about manners. It sounded like a case of rape to me. I think you should face facts, take responsibility for your actions, and not try to justify every bad thing you do."}, {"instruction": "Look you're a shrink, not a priest, so quit preaching. I'm not asking you, or God, to forgive me either. And I don't know why you keep on with that rape thing, I didn't do anything any red-blooded man wouldn't do. I just don't get it.", "input": "", "output": "So it seems. Is there anything else you want to talk about? How are things at work?"}, {"instruction": "I'm hanging in there--autopilot's a wonderful thing. But I purely couldn't give a shit any more, and I think people are starting to realize that. You get a lot more respect when people know you couldn't care less. Most of them leave me alone. When they get in my face they usually back off pretty fast.", "input": "", "output": "How do you do that?"}, {"instruction": "I'm honest with them, that's all. Honesty is the best policy, you know. I tell them exactly what I think of them--I've had women burst into tears. Men just sort of go red, most of them don't say anything, they just split.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, wonderful. How much longer do you think you are going to represent your company if you act like that? Do you intend to lose your job too?"}, {"instruction": "I've got job security, because the guy that would have to fire me--I know where he lives. He doesn't love the company more than his life; I don't think any of them do. So I'm fine, I can work here as long as I live. But who knows how long that's going to be?", "input": "", "output": "Great. Well on that note, we're about out of time, is there any chance you would try some medication?"}, {"instruction": "What's with this medication all the time? You got some pill that will bring my kids back? How about one that will get me laid? I'd take that. What makes you think I can solve my problems with medication?", "input": "", "output": "I think a little attitude adjustment would do you a lot of good. It would certainly make this easier for me. If you can do it without drugs that's fine, but I don't see any sign of it. If you lift the underlying depression a bit, things might not seem so bleak."}, {"instruction": "Okay, why don't you give me a prescription for reefer? They just made it legal. That might mellow me out.", "input": "", "output": "Uh, I don't think so. You definitely don't need anything to make you more paranoid than you already are and some people react that way, you know. The only medically established use for marijuana in any form is as an anti-nausea drug; there's no reason to start using it as a tranquilizer when there are so many safe and predictable drugs out there. For you, I can't advise it.  Sorry. How about Zoloft?"}, {"instruction": "Fuck that--I'm out of here.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Joe."}, {"instruction": "Hi Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Joe. I didn't really expect to see you today."}, {"instruction": "Why not? It's my regular time isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but I thought you were discontinuing our sessions. I didn't think we were making much progress either, for that matter."}, {"instruction": "Maybe it's just a habit. It's good to have somebody to talk to about some of this shit. I don't know who else I'd be able to lay it on. And besides, it's like insurance.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Hanging with those guys I told you about; I could disappear without a trace. I'd like someone to know what happened if I just vanished someday.", "input": "", "output": "How would I know what happened?"}, {"instruction": "You could take a wild guess anyway. These guys don't seem like the kind that mess around.", "input": "", "output": "So why associate with them at all? How does it help you in any way?"}, {"instruction": "They could help me a lot, if they wanted to. They said they'd help me find my wife and kids; the cops sure haven't been much help--if anything, they wanted to pin something on me. But now I'm in touch with some people who know what they're doing.", "input": "", "output": "Even assuming you do find Carol, what good does that do you? If she doesn't want to live with you, you can't force her to."}, {"instruction": "We'll see. If I could just talk to her, face to face...", "input": "", "output": "Then you think you could intimidate her, and everything would be okay again? Is that it?"}, {"instruction": "Call it what you want. She's got to know she can't hide from me like she's been doing. And you can't do anything these days without leaving traces in some fucking computer or other. If she needs to renew her license, the DMV computer pops her right up. If she uses a credit card, a computer's going to show what she bought and the address of the store. If she applies for a phone, or utilities, or food stamps, I've got her. We can get in anywhere--they showed me how easy it is.", "input": "", "output": "And in return for all this help, what do your new pals want from you? Have you gotten to that part yet?"}, {"instruction": "Look, you may not think so but there's a lot I can do. We've discussed several ideas.", "input": "", "output": "Such as?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, this probably isn't the time to get into specifics.", "input": "", "output": "But I can read about it in the newspapers, is that it?"}, {"instruction": "Only if something goes wrong...But that's not going to happen. These guys run a tight ship. They know what they're doing and I fit right in. This is going to be big, really big. I've always wanted to make a difference and this is my chance. I know you think I'm a real loser, but guys like me can change history. Once a guy stops just worrying about himself and looks at the big issues, he can count for a lot.", "input": "", "output": "So you've found some big idea you want to sacrifice your life for, is that it? Don't you think you might be fooling yourself? Don't you think you might be a pawn in a game you don't even understand?"}, {"instruction": "Hey, when soldiers are ready to lay down their lives for their country, nobody says this shit to them. And they've got a lot more to lose than me. Besides if everything goes right, I could make some money on this...", "input": "", "output": "I thought you were doing this out of idealism, a sacrifice for the greater good kind of thing. Now it sounds like you're talking straight crime; what's going on?"}, {"instruction": "I'm in a big hole, right? My cards got yanked and I'm living paycheck to paycheck, but the IRS just garnished my fucking check behind some total bullshit I couldn't even understand, so I got all these guys knocking on the door and \"where's my money, motherfucker,\" and these aren't guys that like waiting. What's the use of going to work if you don't get the fucking money? Anyway, if I'm stuck in a deep pit and somebody throws me a rope, I'm not going to say no, right? I'm not going to ask him why he threw the rope and and I really don't even give a shit, at least not until I'm out of the hole.", "input": "", "output": "Look. If you've got income tax problems, you go to a tax attorney, maybe you can get it straightened out. You don't go out and commit crimes, not if you've got any brains at all. You made the money legally, you probably just have to agree to a payment plan."}, {"instruction": "The guys I borrowed from, they don't believe in payment plans.", "input": "", "output": "Come on, this doesn't have anything to do with therapy, and I'm getting really uncomfortable with the position you're putting me in. If you wanted to try and work to improve your state of mind, I could have helped you, but I'm not going to get involved in your dealings with your creditors or your criminal friends. And if you're determined to go straight to Hell, I really can't stop you. What is there to talk about, the quickest path?"}, {"instruction": "I guess that's about the size of it.", "input": "", "output": "Well in that case, you're doing great. I can't think of anything more you can do to destroy yourself. Why don't you just leave me out of it? Come back if you change your mind, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Does this mean you're throwing me out?", "input": "", "output": "Joe, what do you expect from me? I don't feel I'm helping you, and I don't think you even want me to. Therapy isn't something I can do to you in spite of yourself; all I can do is guide your progress. I think you know that."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's been fun anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe for you. It's made me feel terrible. I feel like I've failed with you, but I honestly don't know what I could have done."}, {"instruction": "Oh come on, it's not your fault. I'm just a magnet for trouble; bad things keep happening to me. I don't know what you could have done about it. Just one more thing.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Come here. Let me tell you in your ear.  Watch out for the Irishman; he's a killer.", "input": "", "output": "If that's what you think then stay away, for God's sake."}, {"instruction": "It's too late, I'm in too deep. But it's been nice knowing you, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Look I tried. If you'd given me any help, it might have been different."}, {"instruction": "Whatever. Goodbye Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Joe."}]
