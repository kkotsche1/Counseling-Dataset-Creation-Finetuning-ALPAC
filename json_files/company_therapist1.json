I can always run off and turn tricks like before.", "input": "", "output": "Do you really think you would be better off doing that?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe. I don't know. It's just that I'm tired of all these people telling me what I got to do with my life and my time. I'm sick of it. Sick of my mom telling me how rotten I am and sick of the courts ordering me to places like this. I'm just...it's just that I hate it, all of this. It's bull.", "input": "", "output": "I would be upset about it, too."}, {"instruction": "Would you? Do you really understand? I don't think anybody really does, you know. Even my friends don't, I think. My mom doesn't, that's for sure. All she understands is her time, her money, her boyfriends. I mean, what a slut! She's got a different boyfriend every night practically. She may as well have a revolving door instead of a front door. How is it that she can judge me? At least when I do it, I get paid for it. She doesn't even have the brains to get something out of it. And these guys, you know, they all treat her like crap and she just takes it. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but prostituting yourself is illegal and dangerous, and it's what got you here in the first place."}, {"instruction": "And? It's the only way I know to get some money so I can participate in society. I mean, no one else is going to help me that way, at least not without something in return. You're only here because you are getting paid, but if you weren't, you'd never try to help. I don't even want your help, you're an old dude! What can an old dude do to help me, anyway? Mind if I smoke?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry.  There's no smoking in offices in San Francisco.  Alex, I said no.  I do mind. Please don't light that up in here Alex."}, {"instruction": "Man, you old dudes are like old or something.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I asked you to not light that up, why did you do it?

Thank you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "So, how can you help me, Doctor? Can you find me another place to live and a job? I don't think you can do that. Plus, I'm not into this psychiatry crap anyway. I don't want to be here.", "input": "", "output": "I understand you don't want to be here.  And I'm not a social worker.  The job and the place to live are not what we do here.

Do you want to talk about the prostitution issue and the assault charges?"}, {"instruction": "Why? You know what I did. So? What about it? I'd do it again, if I had to. It's pretty easy.

Can you believe that? First he wanted me to have sex with him and then he wanted me to do him for free. When I refused to give it up before he showed me the money, I popped him once in the face.  And then, he went off on me. I wasn't going to lose this one, so I went off right back on him. Benny told me that when a trick gets crazy, to act just as crazy or more crazy than they are and they'll back off. It works every time. Well, almost every time.", "input": "", "output": "And do you consider yourself the winner in this case?

He has some permanent nerve damage to his face."}, {"instruction": "So? What you want me to do, send him some flowers or something? I mean, he got what he deserved, you know? He tried to get away with something and I stopped him.  So maybe he won't do it again. At least he'll think twice about it next time.", "input": "", "output": "I imagine you're right about that. But it's possible you may have to face him again sometime. He was pretty severely beaten, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Too much information, Doctor. I don't really give a shit what happened to him.

Alex, would you like to tell me about the trick you described as weird?"}, {"instruction": "Doc? Are you some kind of pervert or something? Why do you care about that?", "input": "", "output": "You brought it up. I thought perhaps we should talk about that."}, {"instruction": "Well, it was kind of funny.  At least Benny thought so.", "input": "", "output": "You've mentioned him before. Who is Benny?"}, {"instruction": "He's my best friend. He teaches me stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Was he with you on this particular job?"}, {"instruction": "No, he never goes.  But he's my buddy. He'll check up on me, if I'm not back by the time I say I'll be. That's what I mean by buddy--we watch out for each other. But that man--I'll call him Ralph--he's an old fart. A real old fart and a big time pervert. The first time I went to his house, he paid me upfront and then told me to strip off all my clothes. Then, he led me into his kitchen and all along the floor--and I mean from wall to wall--he'd lined with buttered slices of white bread. I'm thinking: \"What's he do with this crap all over?\" It was so bizarre. And he was like drooling and stuff. I mean, buttered white bread?", "input": "", "output": "What was it for?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he told me to wriggle around on the bread and act as if I was really turned on by it.", "input": "", "output": "Did you do it?"}, {"instruction": "Of course I did! He paid me two hundred bucks. The weird thing was that he didn't touch me at all. He just watched me squirm and wiggle around all over and that's what got him off! Then, he showed me where to shower and, after, sent me away. It was the strangest. Funny what does it for some people.", "input": "", "output": "You said it was the first time you went there?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I've been back a few times and that's all he ever asks me to do. I've never even touched the guy! But it's cool, because it's good money. Are we done yet? I really need a smoke.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, we are just about out of time. I'll contact your social worker and set up your next appointment. Is there anything I can do for you between now and then?"}, {"instruction": "Just get me out of Juvie and then tell me I don't have to come back.  I mean, it's nothing personal and all.", "input": "", "output": "Sorry, that I can't do.  I'll see you next time, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, later man.", "input": "", "output": "Alex! Please next time, do me a favor and wait until you're out of the building before you light up, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, right.

I'll see you soon."}, {"instruction": "I'm pretty well pissed off, right now.", "input": "", "output": "Why? What is going on?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Marty--he's my social worker--he just told me that I am going to be required to do some community work. Picking up garbage at some of The City's parks. Places like McLaren Park and Delores Park and stuff. I'll have to report 3 times a week starting next Tuesday and I have to be there by 8 am. I'm real pissed off about it; I punched the wall and split my knuckle.", "input": "", "output": "I noticed that you had it wrapped up. This may not be such a bad thing, Alex, doing this community work."}, {"instruction": "Yeah? Sure isn't a good thing, Doc. Shit, I don't want to be picking up trash and other people's garbage. I mean, I see old used-up condoms and thrown out dirty diapers and stuff all the time, plus I saw this little girl one time down at the park off Third Street playing with a syringe. I don't want to get stuck with anything like that; I don't want to take any chances.", "input": "", "output": "You take chances all the time, Alex."}, {"instruction": "What do you know, anyway! What? You think that since I came here that one time that you know everything about me or what?", "input": "", "output": "No, I don't believe that I do. How could I? But it seems that you've chosen a lifestyle that has certain risks--most seriously AIDS and HIV infection."}, {"instruction": "I've been tested and I don't have it, man. Plus, I don't do anything too risky like that. I'm not stupid. I think about that stuff all the time, you know? But the thing is Doc; I probably won't live a very long life anyway. But as far as AIDS is concerned, I take little chances with these tricks and it's not like I am out doing it every night. Most of the times, they just want to do me, you know? Mostly they just get me off and or get themselves off and then they just go on their way. I am certain not to exchange any fluids with anyone. Plus, I go get myself tested every six months. As a matter of fact, I am due for a test now. I time it around my birthday so I can remember.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to know that you take some responsibility in this Alex. I imagine that being a prostitute can present many other risks as well."}, {"instruction": "Well, let's just say that I know how to take care of myself, okay? But I'm not really a prostitute, you know? I just do it sometimes. It's not a regular thing for me. Usually I do it only when I need some cash, but I don't rely on it. Sometimes I get some odd jobs through Benny.", "input": "", "output": "Odd jobs?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, different things. Sometimes I run packages for this dude over to some other guys down on 15th Street. They give me some cash and I don't ask any questions. Most people seem to stay out of my way when I'm walking down the street or driving a car.", "input": "", "output": "You're running drugs, right?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so. I just don't ask them and they don't offer any information. I figure that the less I know about what's inside the package, the better.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, have you ever given any thought as to why you put yourself into these kinds of situations? Or why you take these risks? The way you talk about it makes me think that you don't feel that the risk is that important."}, {"instruction": "But see? This is where you are wrong, Doctor. I know that I take risks and that is precisely the most important part of it.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "The risk is the reason I do it. It's the thrill of it--the rush. I get off on it, in a way.", "input": "", "output": "So the danger is what attracts you to it, is that more accurate?"}, {"instruction": "I guess you can put it that way, yes. The danger is what makes me want to do it. Like I said before, I get a certain rush out of it. It's hard to describe. I can remember one time Benny and I were walking through a grammar school. It was in the early evening about six months ago or so and it was unusually hot that night. Well, I was feeling very horny and I just grabbed him and threw him to the ground right there between the buildings and we went at it. I totally ravaged him; we both had bruises all over. At one point, I saw some kids riding their bicycles through the school yard off in the distance. They could have ridden right over and caught us, and that's the only real reason I felt that I needed to do it. If we had done it somewhere private, I wouldn't have felt so satisfied after.", "input": "", "output": "I think I can understand that."}, {"instruction": "You can? Really? I haven't found anyone who said they understand that. Most people think I'm a freak for that. They sort of back away from me as I'm telling the story. Sometimes, I like to pick people out who I think I can shock and many times when I try to shock them they shock me instead by understanding or something like that. Wow! I am surprised at you, Doc. You're more cool than I thought you could be. I guess you old dudes really know a few things that are worthwhile.", "input": "", "output": "I guess that's true sometimes. So Alex, tell me more about your relationship with Benny. Obviously, you two are more than just friends."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he is my first true love. I fell in love with him when I was only ten. He rescued me from this freak.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean rescued you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, this older kid from up the hall in our building was...well, uh, you know, he was...kind of taking advantage of me and Benny stopped him.", "input": "", "output": "Alex I can see that you are tensing up. In what way was this kid taking advantage of you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't really want to talk about this.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex; we don't have to talk about it if you don't want to."}, {"instruction": "Well, I mean, it wasn't...it isn't easy for me, you know. I mean, I didn't do anything wrong or anything like that. I didn't have a choice. I guess you can say it is the story of my life.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean the story of your life?"}, {"instruction": "Having no choices, you know? People screwing around with me and my mom telling me what to do, and now the courts. It's just that's what I've been all my life--Alex, do this. Alex, do that or don't do this or that! Oh, Alex! Yadda yadda yadda! Or Alex, you're going to do what I tell you to do and you're going to act like you like it. And you know what the problem is Doc? You know what the whole damn problem is?", "input": "", "output": "Tell me."}, {"instruction": "I liked it, Doctor. I liked it when he...when he did it. I don't know why I liked it, but I did. I mean, I didn't know why at the time. I guess I know now.", "input": "", "output": "What did you like, Alex? What did he do?"}, {"instruction": "Damnit, Doctor! I told you I didn't want to talk about it.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, there is some tissue there on the table next to you."}, {"instruction": "Fuck you, I'm not crying. I don't need that shit!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry that you are upset, Alex. Do you want to continue talking about it?"}, {"instruction": "I already told you that I don't want to.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex. Let's talk about something that you do want to talk about, how does that sound? Tell me more about Benny and you."}, {"instruction": "Well see, after we became friends, I kind of liked to think of him as my big brother or the brother that I never had. When I was still living with my grandparents, I had this friend Jimmy and we were always together. But after my grandmother died...shit! I didn't want to get into all this.", "input": "", "output": "You lived with your grandparents at one point?"}, {"instruction": "Well now, that's a real screwed-up story. But if you have the time, I'll tell you all about my lying grandparents.", "input": "", "output": "We still have plenty of time. Please do tell me about them."}, {"instruction": "First of all, as you may have already guessed, they are both dead and buried. Thankfully.", "input": "", "output": "What did they do?"}, {"instruction": "It's both what they did and what they didn't do. You see, Doc, my grandparents raised me as though I was their son. It was when my grandfather died that I think I noticed a change in the way my grandmother and my mother treated each other. They whispered a lot to each other and they also fought quite a bit. But at the time, I didn't know what it was all about. They tried to hide the fighting from me by going into another room, but it's kind of hard to hide that sort of thing when other people are right there in the same house.", "input": "", "output": "You said you didn't know at the time what the fighting and hushed words were about."}, {"instruction": "Right, but I do now. Boy do I know now! You see, I thought all along that my mother was actually my older sister and that my grandparents were my parents. My mother didn't live with us and was not around much, so I only knew her by what my grandparents said about her and they didn't have many nice things to say.", "input": "", "output": "Was she estranged from them?"}, {"instruction": "I think she just was out and partying, stuff like that. Who knows? Maybe she was turning tricks like I do sometimes. But mainly she wasn't around much and it was just me and my grandparents. Once in a while I could overhear my grandmother talking to someone on the phone about her and she always said that she was constantly worried about her and the men she used to hang with. I heard enough of one conversation to know that she was sleeping around a lot--like she does now--and that this one guy beat her up pretty badly one time. My grandmother was crying and crying. It was like she was so upset by it, and I can remember that look in her eyes when she knew I heard the conversation. But we never talked about it.", "input": "", "output": "But they continued to keep things secret from you?"}, {"instruction": "Of course. Out of sight, out of mind. I think that was my family policy. No one wanted to talk about anything too deep.", "input": "", "output": "I'm beginning to sense that. When did you find out the truth?"}, {"instruction": "It was when my grandmother was lying in her hospital bed. My aunt Sofie--my grandmother's sister--was sitting with my grandmother and they were talking about my mother and me and what they were going to do with me after my grandmother was gone. Sofie told my grandmother that she should tell me the truth herself and my grandmother was telling her that she couldn't do it. My aunt kept on begging my grandmother and she was very weak and ill at this point, so she would just close her eyes and pretend that she had fallen asleep and stop talking. Well my aunt just got up and stormed out of the room right past me, she hadn't even noticed that I was standing just outside the door! Even though I didn't hear the whole conversation, I had heard enough of it to know what they meant.", "input": "", "output": "When was it confirmed for you?"}, {"instruction": "The day after my grandmother's funeral. I was staying at Aunt Sofie's and she told me. She and my mom told me, that is. They just sort of sprang it on me, but by then I wasn't surprised. By then, the only thing I wanted to know was if she, Larraine, was my real mother then who was my father? Well, if you can believe it, she wouldn't tell me, the bitch. I mean, here she is telling me that for almost ten years I lived a lie with all these people who knew the truth and now they won't tell me everything that I want to know. I even looked at my birth certificate for the first time and where it's supposed to say father's name, it says unknown. What a goddamned slut! She probably doesn't even know who it was herself. Sometimes I still have nightmares about it. Very vivid nightmares or slow motion languid dreams that disturb me and stick with me all day after.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, do you think I can persuade you to write down some of these dreams, the things you remember about them or maybe how you felt?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, I do already. You mean like a journal, right?", "input": "", "output": "Exactly. Sometimes it can be helpful for me to know what those unconscious thoughts are, so that I can help you to understand them better."}, {"instruction": "Well, I have never even considered showing them to anyone else. It's my personal ideas and stuff, you know. Uh...it's not like I am proud of it or anything like that. It...it kind of makes me nervous to even think about it. What if someone else sees it or something? I mean, once you have it, you have all the dirt on me!", "input": "", "output": "Please calm down, Alex. You are safe with me and you can tell me anything. I won't judge you and I most certainly would never use this against you. Please try to keep in mind that I am trying to help you and if you were to share this with me, I would take care of it as if it were my own. Here, take a tissue."}, {"instruction": "I'm not fucking crying, okay? It's my allergies, you know? It'll pass.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I can see that you are very upset right now and your face is getting red."}, {"instruction": "You're pissing me off again! So what? I'm getting upset. Doesn't your face get red when you get upset?", "input": "", "output": "Of course it does and I'm sorry if I have upset you. It wasn't my intention. Please consider writing a journal for me. If you do any drawings or other things you can bring them in, if you wish."}, {"instruction": "Uh, I don't know. I'll think about it, but I'm not making any promises, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Fair enough then. You know Alex, I think that we have had a very good session today. How do you feel about it?"}, {"instruction": "You seem to be pretty cool and everything, but don't you see, Doctor, that I don't want to relive it all over again? I just want it to go away. That's why I don't want to talk about it and why I don't really want to be here. But you are easy enough to talk to, for an old dude and all.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. I guess I'll take that as a compliment. Now Alex, we are almost out of time so I'd like to explain something for you and want to ask that you think about what I have to say between now and our next meeting. Would you do that for me?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I can try.", "input": "", "output": "Good! Think of your emotions and the things that you said you didn't want to talk about as a liquid and yourself as a bucket. Now the bucket can only hold so much liquid and, at times, the emotions and pain and other life issues fill up the bucket and it starts to spill over. For some people, that manifests itself in physical pain or disease, for others it creates a need for escapism or a fearless attitude."}, {"instruction": "Escapism? What the hell do you mean by that?", "input": "", "output": "Escapism comes out in many ways. For you, it seems that your form of escapism is running around pushing the envelope and getting into trouble. You are fearless in that you do things that may cause you or another harm. These can be considered self-destructive behaviors and it's obvious why they can be detrimental to you. I think you understand that much already."}, {"instruction": "I think I do.", "input": "", "output": "So I'm just asking that you take some time to think about what I've just said. Until our next meeting, please think about it."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, maybe I will. Can I go now?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, our time has run out. Martin will let you know when our next meeting is scheduled. Take care, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, man. Catch you later.", "input": "", "output": "Alex! Don't light that up..."}, {"instruction": "Too late, dude.", "input": "", "output": "Alex! I asked you before..."}, {"instruction": "Hey Doc, how's it hanging? I was just looking down at the street to see if that guy was still following me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean? What guy?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know how to explain it, but I think he's following me or something. Last week...you know, those days that were real hot? Well, I went out and took a long walk down Market Street with my friend Roly. I would've still been asleep, but because it was so hot outside, I couldn't anymore. Anyway, Roly and I were walking down near the Embarcadero, when this guy comes up from behind and asks us if we knew how to get to the Ferry building. Now, this guy was nice looking and all--I mean nicely dressed and a big smile. Usually when they smile like that, they're up to no good. Roly--he was and always is more friendly to people than he needs to be--starts pointing the direction out to him and kind of flirting with the guy.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, the guy walks off and says thanks and all.  But he lingered ahead of us and kept looking back. Well, I was getting a little nervous about him for some reason, and then even Roly noticed the guy looking back at us.  It was real weird. Well, to make a long story short, this guy follows us into Taco Bell and comes up from behind while we were in line.  He says something like he is so appreciative of our help that he wants to do something for us. We both turn around and he has this expensive bouquet of flowers and tries to hand it to me.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't want to take it from him.  But then Roly just sticks his hand out, takes the flowers, and starts to flirt some more with the guy, which is what I thought the guy wanted in the first place. So I ask him why he is going to the Ferry building.  He tells me he needs to catch the Amtrak. Well, as soon as he said that, I knew he was up to no good.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Hello? Doctor? Everyone knows that no trains come that far into the city. So then, I ask him where he came from.  He tells me that he is from Gilroy and that he took BART into the City. I'm thinking, \"Come on! BART doesn't go that far south.\" He must have thought we were idiots or something. Anyway, I tell the guy that we're in a hurry to get somewhere, we say goodbye, and Roly and I go over and sit down in the shade and eat. While we're eating, I happen to see that guy again. This time, he's across the street from us and is looking straight in our direction.", "input": "", "output": "Did Roly notice him?"}, {"instruction": "No. I'm certain he didn't.  And I didn't say anything to him because he gets kind of weird about stuff like that. I just led Roly through some buildings and stuff to lose that guy.", "input": "", "output": "And did you lose him?"}, {"instruction": "I thought we had, but then this past Wednesday when I was doing my slave labor community work, I felt like I was being watched. When I spotted him, he tried to run away.  I was starting to go after him, when he jumped onto the MUNI and got away. Then again today, as I was leaving the park--I got stuck with Delores Park by the way--I noticed him again  As the bus was pulling away, there he was on the opposite corner looking directly at me!", "input": "", "output": "Did you see him again before you came into this building?"}, {"instruction": "No, that's why I was looking out the window--to see if I could spot him out there on the street somewhere. This has got me bugged something fierce! The guy looks familiar to me, but I can't seem to place him. When I told Benny about him the other day, he said it was probably that guy who was going around murdering gay guys all over the country. I'm like: \"Thanks a lot, pal!\" Just what I need--to get paranoid.", "input": "", "output": "How are you going to handle it if he shows up again?"}, {"instruction": "The only thing I can do is keep my wits about me and stay alert, you know? I'm already on edge this week.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Starting this garbage pick-up bullshit has thrown me off.  And sometimes I just get hyper, you know? It's like all of a sudden I get this surge of nervous energy and I can't sit still. First, I'll get the surge of energy, and then I do what I call the crash and burn.", "input": "", "output": "The crash and burn?"}, {"instruction": "That's when I just collapse. I lose all the energy I had before and I'm way out of it. That part is not so bad.  It's the nervous tension I can't stand. I get shaky and stuff. And sometimes, my palms get sweaty like they are right now.", "input": "", "output": "I noticed that you've been shaking your foot."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's one of the things I do. I get agitated--that's how Benny describes it. Like he says, I'm full of piss and vinegar.", "input": "", "output": "That's an interesting way of putting it."}, {"instruction": "Usually, I go through this state where I'm so chock full of energy that I don't sleep for days at a time. But then, when crash and burn time comes, I can sleep for a full day without waking up at all. But during the energized state, I usually feel pretty happy and all I want to do is move move move!", "input": "", "output": "What do you do with yourself when you get like that?"}, {"instruction": "Usually, if it gets real bad, I get Benny to give me some tranquilizer or something. But I don't like to do that too much, you know? I like to keep my head clear. Drugs never did much for me. I can't stand to be around Benny when he is tweaking, you know? But most of the time, I go out and walk all over town and try to burn it off.", "input": "", "output": "Do you do this at any hour?"}, {"instruction": "Doc, you haven't seen this city--I mean really seen it--until you do two things. First, walk around town. Second, walk around town at two or three in the morning. It's very interesting, and you get to see all sorts of life going on out there. You can see all the riff raff and the homeless wandering around, and depending on what neighborhood you're in, you can see the rich people in their fancy clothes and stuff. It's real cool.", "input": "", "output": "I can only imagine. What about your mother? Doesn't she try to stop you from going out at those hours?  Does she say anything at all about it?"}, {"instruction": "Shit, Doc. Most of the time she doesn't even know I'm gone. She's either passed out drunk, or messing around with one of her boyfriends, or she's out running around herself! Jeez, right now she's off on some trip for ten days.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean? Where did she go?"}, {"instruction": "Last Saturday, I got the mail out of the box and brought it up into the house for her. There she was sitting on the sofa, shuffling through it, when all of a sudden she yelled out and then she started to stand up. Then she passed out right there.", "input": "", "output": "She fainted?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I mean, I thought I was dreaming or something, you know? She just dropped down like a puppet whose strings had just been cut.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know why? What was it she saw?"}, {"instruction": "I looked through her mail and didn't see anything that stood out for me. The one thing that did strike my memory was when she announced she was going up to Vancouver, I remembered seeing a letter that had a return address in Canada. Mount Grouse or something, I think. But the name meant nothing to me.", "input": "", "output": "Where are you staying now?"}, {"instruction": "At the house.", "input": "", "output": "Are you alone there?"}, {"instruction": "Well...no...sort of, but not really. I mean, Benny comes over when he's not at work.  And my Aunt Sofie has been coming over every day to check up on me. But don't worry about me, Doctor, I really can take care of myself.", "input": "", "output": "I know that you believe that, Alex, but..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor! Please don't try to make me go somewhere else or do something that would get her in trouble. I'm okay there.  I really am. She's done this kind of thing before.  Not as dramatic as this, but...sometimes I wonder about her. No, I take that back.  I wonder about her all the time. But really, my aunt is just a couple of blocks away, and Benny is always available to me.", "input": "", "output": "I was thinking about this person who you think may be following you..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, that. Yeah, that's kind of weird, huh?", "input": "", "output": "It's cause for concern, Alex. What's wrong? What are you thinking?"}, {"instruction": "I was just thinking about the way he looked. He did look familiar to me.  And I'm wondering if...no, it couldn't be him.", "input": "", "output": "Who?"}, {"instruction": "It just hit me that he looks like that guy I beat up a few weeks ago. Nah, no way.  It couldn't be him.", "input": "", "output": "You mean the one you were arrested for assaulting?"}, {"instruction": "He's the only one I've beaten up recently. But it couldn't be him--he didn't look quite right. He wouldn't be that bold, I mean, to follow me, or stalk me, or something like that.  You think? He was threatening to sue me.  But I mean, come on! He wouldn't be that stupid. I knew he wouldn't sue me.  But stalk me? I never even thought about that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  I wouldn't rule that out. Alex, maybe you ought to think about getting the police involved. At least explain to Martin what's been going on. I really would hate to see anything...any repercussions come back to you on this.  And if this adult trick is really stalking you...well, you know what I'm leading up to."}, {"instruction": "I think so. The police would probably tell me that they couldn't do anything until he does something. They're good for nothing, you know.", "input": "", "output": "But maybe you ought to make a report about it anyway. Martin is there to help you out with this sort of thing, so why not utilize that resource? A report would be on file, just in case something does happen."}, {"instruction": "I'll talk to him about it.  I have to go over there today anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Be cautious, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Always am, Doc. Hey, you know that thing you were telling me about the bucket and the water spilling over and all?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "That makes a lot of sense to me now. That would explain why I get so hyper and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "That's possible. There are some other medical things that I think we should look at as well."}, {"instruction": "What? How do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "It's too early to make a diagnosis, Alex.  But there are some medical conditions which could explain the symptoms that you've described, including Hypomania. Have you ever heard of it?"}, {"instruction": "What? You think I'm crazy, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "No, not at all. We need to explore this further, that's all."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I don't have Hypo-whatever.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not saying that you do.  But most people don't have such extreme periods of up and down.  So I would like to discuss this a bit more next time, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Whatever.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, we've run out of time for today.  I want to give you my card again, in case you haven't kept it with you. Keep it with you and if you ever need anything, day or night, please don't hesitate to call me."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doc.  But I probably won't be in need of anything from you.", "input": "", "output": "Just in case, Alex. And like I said, day or night. If I'm not in, my answering service can always reach me. Keep it in mind, okay? I'll see you next week?"}, {"instruction": "I'll catch you later. Rage on, dude!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey Doctor, how are you doing?", "input": "", "output": "I'm better, thank you.  But what happened to you, Alex? How did you get that bruise on your forehead?"}, {"instruction": "Oh that. I got it the other night at the club. Do you remember that guy I thought was following me? Well, he showed up again. This time, I was dancing at the club--I was going around wiggling and shaking my stuff trying to get people to put money in my little string thing. Thank god that Benny was right there next to me when it happened.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, please, you're speaking rather quickly. I need to ask you to slow down. That bruise is awful. Is there more besides the one I can see? And what are you talking about?  You dance for money?"}, {"instruction": "I thought I told you about that. Well see, I go over to the club and get into the strip show sometimes, so I can get some cash.  And since my mom is still away and I ran out of money, I thought I'd just go over there and do my thing. Benny says I should get into porn or something. He thinks I could really make it doing that, but I don't know. It sounds kind of fun, but still...well...I mean, I'm not even old enough to dance yet.  But as long as they don't know, then I'm okay. Because I'm so tall, they think I'm older, you know? I figure the more stuff like that I do, the better the chance is to get caught and I don't want to get the people at the club into any trouble. So, you know, like my mom is still on her little trip, and here I am needing some money, and I don't want to ask my aunt for any because then she'll make me stay there at her house, and I don't even want to go into that. Yeah, so this bruise, it's pretty bad, isn't it? Everyone keeps asking me about it. I wish it would just go away.", "input": "", "output": "It's bad, Alex. Why don't you take a deep breath and then slowly tell me what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Anyway, here I am dancing around the bar and stuff, and a lot of these old dudes are shaking their dollar bills at me and grabbing at me and stuff. I was having such a good time, too. So this dude, you know, the one who was following me around? Well all of a sudden, there he is and he grabs my little g-string thing and yanks on it, nearly tearing it off me.  And just then, Benny notices that something isn't right. So Benny tries to push him off me, you know? Then, you know what the fucker did? He grabs me and then he looks straight into my eyes.  And I knew right then.  I knew.", "input": "", "output": "You knew it was him? The guy you had assaulted? Alex? What do you have under your coat? Did I see something move under there?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. I hope you don't mind.  I had to bring her with me today. I didn't want to leave her at home since the house got broken into yesterday. I came home to find the place a mess.  Her cage was turned over. She was in total shock  It took me all night to get her to calm down. See? She's my baby. She won't hurt you. Her name's Darla. Darla, meet Doctor B. Here, want to pet her?", "input": "", "output": "No, thanks. You didn't tell me that you had a pet rat.  Did you just say your house was broken in to?"}, {"instruction": "It was. I couldn't believe it.  And my mom is going to kill me when she gets back. I can't tell if anything was taken. I mean, they didn't take anything of value, if they took anything at all. The computer and the TV are both still there. None of my leather jackets were touched. It's real weird. She's going to think that I had something to do with it, you know? She always assumes the worst of me. But the place was a mess. It took hours for Benny and me to clean it up.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have the police take a report?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I did. Aunt Sofie's real upset about it.  She didn't want me to stay there by myself.  But I'm like, okay, here we have a door that's broken and no way to fix it. And I'm going to leave the place so someone else can come in and rob us? Hello? No thanks! Plus, I've been so wound up this week that I'd just keep her up all night long.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. Is Benny or Roly staying with you?"}, {"instruction": "Benny stayed over last night.  He may stay again tonight. I'm not sure.", "input": "", "output": "What about that bruise? Let's go back to that."}, {"instruction": "So anyway, here I was in the hands of this freak of nature. I must have really messed him up bad, Doctor. He looks slightly different from what I remembered. His face is twisted sort of. Anyway, he's got me by both my arms and he looks into my eyes.  I recognized him.  And then, he head-butts me! Just like that.  Wham! Head-butts me! He just slams his head into mine, and I am out. Totally out of it. When I came around, I felt like one of those cartoon characters with the little stars popping all around my head and the curly lines twisting up above.  And all these people and this hunk of a paramedic guy were surrounding me.  And Benny and Roly both were gone. Later, they told me that they went after the guy and that he won't be bothering me anymore. I don't know what they did, but I haven't seen him since.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds fortunate that Benny and Roly were both there. You don't know what they did to him?"}, {"instruction": "No. I don't really care. I hope they killed him or something, you know? Some people...I was telling Benny that this is why I'd rather do dancing than turn tricks--some of these guys are total freaks. I'm sure you can guess by now. Oh shit! Doctor, I'm sorry.", "input": "", "output": "What are you sorry for?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I wasn't paying attention, and now she's gotten loose.", "input": "", "output": "Loose? What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Don't worry, man. She does that, you know? She'll run off or climb down or something. Oh, there she is! She climbed up on that little credenza thing you have there behind you. It's a good thing you don't have a lot of stuff for her to rummage around in.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I'd appreciate it if you could keep her from doing that again."}, {"instruction": "It's cool. I got it under control, man. Hang on a second, dude. Darla, come! See? I just make this little clicking noise with my tongue and bend over a bit, and she'll jump right up on my shoulder. See? She's such a little show off.", "input": "", "output": "You have her well-trained.  That's very impressive, Alex. I've never seen a rat do something like that before."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she's very smart. It takes no time to teach her new stuff. But this jumping thing, I didn't teach her. She just started doing it on her own one day.  I made the clicking noise connection by accident. I figure there's something that she likes about that sound that makes her do it. One time, she missed and jumped right over my shoulder and landed on the floor behind me.", "input": "", "output": "I hope she wasn't hurt."}, {"instruction": "Not at all. I was more scared about it than she was. Oooh! Ouch!", "input": "", "output": "What is it, Alex?"}, {"instruction": "I just got one of those sharp headaches I've been getting since that jerk head-butted me. They hit in an instant. And then just as quickly, it's over.", "input": "", "output": "Have you seen a doctor yet?"}, {"instruction": "Only that paramedic man. You know, that guy even called me the next day to check up on me.  And he wanted me to take his number down. So I did. I might call him again. Pretty nice of him, huh?", "input": "", "output": "It was a nice thing for him to do. You said a minute ago that you have been all wound up. Is it because of this incident at the club? Or did that episode from two weeks ago ever go away?"}, {"instruction": "No. I was all tensed up before that. Yeah, I think I've been this way on and off now for a while. It's so funny. Here I am all energized all night long and then, when it comes time to report for that purgatory slave labor, I suddenly get work-apnea!", "input": "", "output": "That's an interesting way of putting it. But what do you mean exactly? How long has this phase been going on?"}, {"instruction": "Well, about two weeks now, I think. Maybe even before I last came here to see you. But it's just because of all the bullshit that's been going on--the freak of the month following me around and stuff. And my mom being gone...although that's not such a bad thing.  It's just that with the place getting busted in to and all. So here I am.  I'm hyperventilating and stuff there while I'm supposed to be picking up trash.  And my heart's all pounding away like it's going to jump right out of my chest or something. Well, I guess I'm just wound up, okay? It's happened before. No biggie.", "input": "", "output": "We talked a bit last time about these hyperactive stages you go through.  Well, here's what I'd like to suggest. I think you ought to go to a doctor and get checked out--maybe a neurologist. These headaches could indicate something more serious. Hyperventilating and pounding heart are a bit suspect as well. Now, when does you mother return?"}, {"instruction": "She's back today or tomorrow. I'm not sure exactly. Damn Doctor, I don't want to go to the neurologist.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Do you have a regular physician?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Doctor Witzig.", "input": "", "output": "Would you be willing to go see him? These headaches really concern me. It would be a good idea to get thoroughly checked out. Alex, I hope the headaches concern you too."}, {"instruction": "Well, they do kind of. I guess I can call him.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Perhaps you can give him my telephone number? Also, would you have your mother give me a call?"}, {"instruction": "I knew this was coming! Shit. I don't want her talking to you.  She'll just get you all confused and shit. She's good at that, you know?", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, Alex.  She won't confuse me. I would like to talk with the both of them.  Will that be all right with you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'll tell her. But I'm not making any promises that she'll call you. I'll tell the doctor, too. He's cool. I don't care what he tells you or what you two talk about. Why do you want to talk to my mom?", "input": "", "output": "Your mother has been an important person in your life, Alex.  I'm not implying that she has always done right by you, but I think it is important that we bring her in on some of our discussions.  I think it might help me to help you solve some of your problems."}, {"instruction": "I'm warning you, Doc, she's something else. She will try to manipulate you and control what happens here. So far, she's been pretty good about this.  I'm surprised she hasn't already tried to meddle in this. Hell! She might even try to get you in bed or something. Or she'll do something to get you going.", "input": "", "output": "Don't worry about me, Alex.  I can handle your mother."}, {"instruction": "Don't say I didn't warn you. She's the mistress of manipulation. Particularly if you're male. She likes it that way. Boy, I'm glad she's in Canada. It's actually been nice having her away like this. I could really get used to this. I look around the house and think how great it is to have a little bit of sanctuary and privacy. Yeah, I'll tell her to call you. It would be interesting to see what she'll try to do to you. I know I'll be surprised if she doesn't try something!", "input": "", "output": "Well, it's not a problem, Alex. I see all kinds of people in my line of work. We've run out of time. So I'll see you again next week. And, Alex, please try to get yourself to the doctor, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure enough, Doc man. I'll be here. And I'll go there, too!", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Alex.  Bye, Darla."}, {"instruction": "Hurry, Doctor! Close the door and lock it!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, what's going on? Why do you want me to lock the door?"}, {"instruction": "Because she's out there and she wants to come in here! I don't want her in here. Not now. Not yet. She's out there looking for a place to park the car. Doctor! We have to lock the damn door!", "input": "", "output": "Who's out there? Your mom?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Can we take your name off the door before she finds us?", "input": "", "output": "No, Alex, we won't do that. Alex, she'll find my suite number on the building directory. When she gets here I will answer the door..."}, {"instruction": "But, Doc! I told you that I don't want her in here with us. There's some stuff I got to tell you about before she comes in!", "input": "", "output": "Calm down, Alex, please. Now then, if you don't wish to have her join us, then I can tell her that our sessions are private and she'll have to wait for you outside. But I have another idea."}, {"instruction": "No! No ideas. I don't want her to come in here with us! Doctor, please! That bitch is going to try to fuck with me...with us and our heads and stuff. She's been pissed off at me ever since she came back from Canada. When she saw the house and found out what happened, man, I'm telling you, she was in a state.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, listen to me. You need to slow down here and stay calm. You're getting yourself all worked up. My idea is that we let her come in here..."}, {"instruction": "No! If you do, I'll run out of here and will never come back again!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, please listen to what I have in mind. How about if she comes in here and you go out. Let us talk for just a short time. Then you can come back in here, and you and I can continue our session? How does that sound?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, man. She's on high. I mean it's like she's on a rampage or something. She's really scary when she's like this. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Trust me, Alex. Just give me a few minutes alone with her, okay? You can go outside and have a cigarette while you are waiting. Is that okay with you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I guess I'll decide when she gets up here. Hell, maybe she won't be able to find a place to park her precious little car. She's real picky about where she parks it, you know? It's never in-between two cars. She always has to park on the end so the driver door won't be in danger of getting dented. And man, watch out if you get your fingerprints on the finish! It's a real sickness, Doc, I'm telling you.", "input": "", "output": "You said she's on a rampage. Is she blaming you for the break-in?"}, {"instruction": "I told you she would. It took me a while to figure out what my mom...uh, I mean my grandma used to say about her being the queen of high drama. When she came home last week, the minute she came into the house, she noticed that a lot of stuff was missing.", "input": "", "output": "But you said that nothing was taken?"}, {"instruction": "That's right. But the stuff that was missing was the shit that was broken. That was what Benny and I spent the entire day cleaning up. Whoever broke in just wanted to mess the place up, nothing more I suppose. But the glass was everywhere. I'm still finding tiny pieces of it. I have to really watch Darla, when she's roaming around these days, because I'm worried that she'll step on a piece of it, you know? I would hate myself if she got hurt.", "input": "", "output": "So your mother is upset about the place getting ransacked? I can understand her anger about it--it's a big violation, Alex. Didn't you feel a bit violated yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, you don't know what violation really is, I guess. It was kind of weird getting broken in to, but no, I didn't feel violated. Violated is when someone sticks a knife to your throat and rapes you. Or head butts you when you're in a public place wearing only a g-string. You know, I've been having nightmares about all that, too.", "input": "", "output": "I vividly perceive your ideas about violation and yes, I do understand. It's important to keep a perspective on it. But, Alex, surely you see that there are different levels of being violated? Take your assault case, for example."}, {"instruction": "Why? Hey, man, this is like taking two steps backwards and I don't want to go there, okay?", "input": "", "output": "This man was following you around because he felt violated."}, {"instruction": "Well, uh...I didn't think of it that way. But why are you telling me this? Are you trying to give me a guilt trip or something?", "input": "", "output": "No. No, Alex. I didn't intend for you to see it like that and I'm sorry that you did. My point is this, violation comes in many forms and your mother most certainly feels violated by the break-in. Can you see it from that angle?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so, but...it's not like that, Doctor. She thinks I did it and made-up the story about the break-in to try to cover it up or something. Just like she thought I made up the story about getting...shit! It's happening again!", "input": "", "output": "What is it, Alex? Oh, I see..."}, {"instruction": "You know, Doctor, when my grandmother died, it was like my entire world came crashing down around me. And like...well, all this really bad stuff started happening to me. If she had just stayed alive and not left me like that, well, then it would all be okay, you know? I probably wouldn't be here talking to you. I'd be out having a normal life, like I used to have before I was sent to live with pig-bitch lady.", "input": "", "output": "When someone so close to you dies, it results in a lot of transitions and change in one's life.  Not just yours, Alex, everybody's. Here, take a tissue."}, {"instruction": "Fuck! I feel like such a little pussy-sweater-boy, whimpering away about something I had no control over. Nah, I don't need your damn tissue, Doc! I told you before...", "input": "", "output": "They're right there if you find that you want to use them, Alex. I don't feel ashamed about crying. You're safe here with me."}, {"instruction": "Yeah? Well, not for long, Doctor. Pig-bitch lady will be up here any minute now. She can't see me like this, Doctor. She just can't! Do you have a back door to this place? I'm starting to feel a little sick. Oh my god! I've got to get out of here!", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. Sit down. Why don't you take some deep, slow breaths and try to calm yourself a bit. Here, I'll move the trash can next to you, just in case...and help yourself to some water, if you want. Alex, when people lose someone so dear to them--so very important to them--it's perfectly normal to feel the way you do. Now, I'm quite concerned about these episodes. It appeared as if you were about to hyperventilate and you mentioned something about this sort of thing happening to you the last time we met."}, {"instruction": "It's not the first time, if that's what you're leading up to. Remember I told you about doing it when I was supposed to be working my trash rounds at the park? I get upset and then, bang! I have trouble breathing and I get sort of dizzy and sick to my stomach. And ever since I told you about how Benny and I met, well, I've been having these bad dreams a lot. The kind of dreams that stick with me all day long and...oh my god, Doctor, she's here!", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. Now, I'm going to go over and answer the door. I'll go out into the other room and talk with her for a few minutes, okay? Try to relax yourself, hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor! Don't go out there yet! I have to tell you about something really important, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Okay. But I must answer the door for her. I'll ask her to wait. Just a second, Alex. Hello, I'm Doctor Balis."}, {"instruction": "I'm Larraine Rozzi. Is Alex in there? I've been driving around trying to find a place to park. I really wanted to get in here earlier. Alex? What are you doing in there? Get your butt out here where I can see what you're up to! Doctor? Do you just let him have his run of your office like that?", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Rozzi, do you mind waiting out here for a few minutes? Alex and I aren't quite ready for you just yet."}, {"instruction": "You little...just you wait!", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Rozzi! Alex, please, put that chair down! Let's all settle down."}, {"instruction": "I'll just sit right here, Doctor, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Ms. Rozzi. We won't be long."}, {"instruction": "Oh Doctor, don't be so formal. Please call me Larraine. Hey, nice tie. I'll bet some lucky girl gave that to you. I like it, it's funky.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, well...uh, thank you, Larraine. Please excuse me. Alex? Is everything okay? Good."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you finally met my mom. That fucking bitch! See? See how she talks to me? And she did just what I thought she'd do. She's already trying to flatter you, and I noticed that she thinks you're attractive. She'll try to get you in bed, just you wait. What a bitch! And you know that appointment she mentioned? She's having her nails done, and that's far more important than anything else. She's such a bitch!", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Alex, that's enough, okay? Now, you mentioned that you needed to tell me something important?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I did. Well, she came home last Thursday and she was all happy and shit--until she saw the house. But she was happy--she was jumping around, singing to herself, walking funny. I've never seen her like that before. It was so strange. Anyway, she came home a couple days ago with this man. He looked to be a little bit older than her. And she says to me, \"Alex, I want to introduce you to your father.\"", "input": "", "output": "Your father?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Can you believe it? I mean, do you know how many times that slutty bitch came home with some jerk and told me to call him daddy? I can't even tell you. But I looked at her and then at him and back at her again. And then I said, \"You fucking bitch!\" And then I ran out the front door. I wasn't going to stay around for this bullshit, you know? I mean, what kind of crap is that anyway--her playing fucking head games with me like that, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I can see how that would shock you. What happened next?"}, {"instruction": "Well, as I was running down the steps, this guy came after me and said something like, \"You can't talk to your mother that way! Come back here!\" And I looked back up at him and told him he wasn't my father. And that he would never be my father. So he shouldn't try to tell me what I can say or do! \"Fuck off, mister! My father's dead!\" And then I walked away.", "input": "", "output": "Where did you go?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I went over to Ralph's.", "input": "", "output": "Ralph?"}, {"instruction": "You know who he is. He's that buttered white bread man, remember? The weird trick? Well, he had called me earlier that day because he hurt his back and wanted me to come and help him. So that's where I've been staying the past couple nights.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, we are running out of time. I'd like to talk with your mother for a few minutes and then with you again, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'll go down and have a smoke. How about if I come back in about five minutes?", "input": "", "output": "That sounds good, Alex.  Ms. Rozzi, would you like to come in now?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. Where the hell do you think you're going, mister? Get back here! Doctor, where does he think he's doing?", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Ms. Rozzi. He's going outside for a few minutes while we talk. Please sit down. Alex has told me quite a bit about you."}, {"instruction": "I bet he has.", "input": "", "output": "He told me that you went away for a while..."}, {"instruction": "Just a couple of days.  It wasn't a big deal.  And I had my aunt look after him, so it wasn't like Alex was alone or...", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't judging you, Ms. Rozzi."}, {"instruction": "I thought it was Larraine?", "input": "", "output": "Alex told me that when you came back, you were not alone.  And, in fact, you introduced your companion as Alex's father."}, {"instruction": "That's Mark and he is Alex's father. Trust me, Doctor Balis. I know that.  Alex doesn't.", "input": "", "output": "Does Mark have something to do with your trip to Canada?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes. Yes it does, as a matter of fact. We had lost contact years ago...well before Alex was born, and he recently sent me a letter. I was so shocked. I was thunderstruck by his letter. I fainted when I saw it was from him. He had no idea that I was even pregnant. The day I found out I was pregnant was the day he disappeared. I figured he found out somehow and didn't want to be involved with it, knowing how my parents could be. But that wasn't the case at all.", "input": "", "output": "What happened to him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's a very long arduous story, Doctor. It may take a while to explain. Maybe I can come to see you again and we can talk about this. Or better yet, why don't you and I go out to dinner and we can discuss it then? You aren't married, I presume?", "input": "", "output": "No, I'm not. Alex is my patient and you're his mother.  It would be inappropriate for me to go to dinner with you.  But I would like to  make an appointment with you to discuss Alex."}, {"instruction": "Do you find me unattractive? Is that why you don't want to go out with me?", "input": "", "output": "It has nothing to do with it.  I have certain professional ethics and going to dinner with you would violate them. We're here to talk about Alex."}, {"instruction": "I don't mean to sound like a bitch, but he brings it all on himself by lying and cheating. You ought to see what he did to my house, not to mention my car! He made up some lame story about the place getting broken into. Well, if someone really did break-in, then why the hell didn't they take anything? He's out of control, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I believe he's being honest about that. You should have seen him the day after the break-in--we had a session then. But I'm really more concerned about his physical health. We need to have your general practicioner authorize some tests.  I think I'd like a radiologist to do a work-up of his head."}, {"instruction": "Well, I could've told you that, Doctor. He's needed someone to have a good look at his head for quite some time now.", "input": "", "output": "That's not what I meant. Didn't you notice his forehead? I think he may have suffered a concussion."}, {"instruction": "Oh please, Doctor. He's just bleeding for some attention. Don't let him fool you.", "input": "", "output": "I think you need to step back a little and really see what's going on with your son, Ms. Rozzi. He had suffered a lot of emotional traumas in his life and he's been deeply affected by them--the death of his grandmother and grandfather, the realization that you are his real mother, and recently..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he's deeply affected, all right. Tell me something I didn't already know.", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Rozzi, I'm trying to be as serious and forthright with you as I can. Can you try to do the same with me?"}, {"instruction": "Look, I know that he's a messed up little boy and that he's probably blaming me for all of it. But he really does bring these things on himself, you know? It's karma--what goes around, comes around. I always tell him that.", "input": "", "output": "He does have some serious problems, and that's what I hope to discuss in more detail with you. We can help each other and help him at the same time. Everyone will benefit, if you and I can work together on this. Do you think we can?"}, {"instruction": "I'll try, Doctor. I'll try. Look, it's very late.  I've got to go now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Where's Alex?", "input": "", "output": "He said that he'd come back up after five minutes."}, {"instruction": "He's probably gotten himself into some trouble. He's good at that, you know? Or he's up to his games again.", "input": "", "output": "I'll call down to the pharmacy that's in the retail space at the front and see if they can tell him to come up. Hello, Dick? This is Doctor Balis. A patient of mine--a tall young man with long black hair--should be outside the doors, smoking a cigarette. Could you do me a favor and ask him to come back up? Okay, I'll wait. What? What was that? You don't? Did you look around the corner there? I see. Well, thank you. Well, Ms. Rozzi, apparently Alex has left. He's not out there."}, {"instruction": "What did I tell you? Alex's games again. Well, Doctor, I'll be on my way then. I'll call you when I get into my office and we can schedule an appointment. Thanks, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Rozzi?"}, {"instruction": "Please call me Larraine.", "input": "", "output": "Larraine, this concerns me. I don't think that Alex would just go like that, without saying anything to me."}, {"instruction": "Obviously you don't know Alex the way I do. It's just like him to pull something like this. I could have predicted it. Oh well, I'm on my way. Doctor? If you change your mind about dinner, just give me a call, okay? That really is a nice tie. Did I mention that before?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Yes, you did."}, {"instruction": "See you again. Soon, I hope.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Ms. Rozzi. Hello? This is Doctor Balis. Hi, Dick.  What? Oh, I see. A wallet? Alex Rozzi?  Yeah, that's my patient. Why don't you give it to his mother, she should be walking out just about now. Oh, she did? A tall, nice looking woman, dressed somewhat flashy? Yes, that's her. Oh well, hang onto it for me and I'll pick it up on my way out. Thanks. I'll see to it that he gets it back. Thanks again, Dick.  I appreciate it. Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Oh no, thank you, Doctor. I was looking forward to seeing you again. I see you're wearing another one of those ties that I like so much. I like a man with his own sense of style.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Ms. Rozzi."}, {"instruction": "Now now, Doctor, I told you before to call me Larraine?", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Larraine. Now, we're here to discuss Alex, and I have some questions I'd like to ask of you. Would that be all right?"}, {"instruction": "Anything for you, Doctor. Fire away.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to start with some background information. Would you tell me please, what were the circumstances that led to your parents taking Alex and raising him as their own son?"}, {"instruction": "I was afraid you'd want to know that. Well, if I must, let me just start out by saying that I never really wanted him. Alex, I mean.", "input": "", "output": "That's very honest.  Thank you. Why didn't your parents tell him the truth about who they really were?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we can thank my mom for that, rest her soul. She was embarrassed of me, I think. I don't know why really...why they lied about all that. But I went along with it because it was a convenient way of getting out of my responsibility. I was wild and out of control, just like Alex is now, and that's the reason we don't get along.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "He's just like I was, and it drives me crazy. He drives me crazy.", "input": "", "output": "Please, go on."}, {"instruction": "For my parents, Alex was the son they never had.  See?  They always wanted a boy, not that they didn't try...after me, that is.", "input": "", "output": "Your parents wanted to have more children?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so. Not that they were qualified. But God saw to it that they didn't have any more, thankfully. My mom suffered several miscarriages and then, eventually, the doctor told her that she could never have children again.", "input": "", "output": "You said that you didn't want Alex. Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I still don't, actually. Still don't. But the reason I didn't want him--this demon child that was growing inside of me--was that Mark just up and disappeared on me. I think I told you that before. And every time I felt that thing inside of me moving, I would think of Mark. I hated him for leaving me and I hated the idea of this thing growing inside of me, leeching off my body, kicking me from in there, making me feel like shit. I think I didn't even consider abortion because of my Catholic upbringing. I don't believe in abortion. And he really turned out to be the bad seed after all! Alex resembles Mark a lot, by the way.", "input": "", "output": "Mark really is Alex's biological father?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Did he tell you why he left?"}, {"instruction": "It had to do with the drugs.", "input": "", "output": "Drugs?"}, {"instruction": "Mark was a coke dealer. Coke was big in 1982 here in the city. About two weeks before he left, our friend--his business partner, Steve--was killed in a gang-related thing. That really spooked all of us. It seemed that Mark was the next in line.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So that's it.  God, I forgot how this affected me. I haven't spoken about this to anyone in years, you know?", "input": "", "output": "There are some tissues right there, if you like. Did you tell Alex this story?"}, {"instruction": "Of course not! Why would I do that?", "input": "", "output": "I think Alex would appreciate you being honest with him.  He would recognize the truth in your story and it might help him understand you better."}, {"instruction": "No way! And how would I tell him this? He'd really have a low opinion of me then, not that it wouldn't be warranted. What a stupid idea!", "input": "", "output": "I disagree. I believe that it would be best if you sat down and told him the truth, the entire truth. It would be good for both of you. Alex really craves to know who his father is, and he was very shocked and upset by the way you introduced Mark to him."}, {"instruction": "Well, he didn't seem that way to me. He just screamed and swore at us and then charged out of the house.", "input": "", "output": "Try to put yourself in his place.  Alex told me that he wanted to know who his father was, but when he confronted you, you refused to tell him anything.  Now, you just casually introduce Alex to a man that you say is his father.  Alex is having some problems with that. I believe it would be good if you talked to Alex about all of this.  Would you think about it?"}, {"instruction": "We'll see. Alex isn't even around for me to say anything to him right now.", "input": "", "output": "Where is he?"}, {"instruction": "He ran off again. He's staying at Ralph's house.", "input": "", "output": "Ralph?"}, {"instruction": "He lives on upper Market and has a nice, big house with a view of the skyline. It'll be good for Alex to stay there awhile so we can both cool down. It's actually been kind of nice having the house to myself, for a change. Plus, Ralph seems to be a safe man. I'm not worried about Alex; I know where he is.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. You're in contact with Alex?"}, {"instruction": "If I want, yes. But I think it's better if I leave him alone right now and he leaves me alone. Sofie thinks that I should march up there and force Alex to come home. But he's just like me--he does what he wants, when he wants. If I tried to force it, he'd run off again.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  You said earlier that even now you still don't want Alex. Can we talk about that?"}, {"instruction": "Why?", "input": "", "output": "I believe you when you say that. But I think there's a part of you that does care about him. I can see that in your face. But I'm very concerned that you have so little interest in the way Alex takes care of himself and what he does."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I don't need a lecture. I didn't always do this with him. He has an innate ability to take care of himself, in case you haven't noticed. We're talking about a sixteen-year-old boy. It isn't as if he's ten. Geez!", "input": "", "output": "I'm not trying to lecture you, Ms. Rozzi. But I'm worried about Alex.  And I'm not all that sure about how well he takes care of himself.  But to get back to my original question, can you articulate the reasons you don't want Alex in your life?  And don't you think that Alex would sense that you feel that way about him?"}, {"instruction": "The feeling is mutual, Doctor, in case you haven't noticed.", "input": "", "output": "I noticed, believe me. Is it the responsibility? Is that why you say you don't want him?"}, {"instruction": "That's part of it. You see, Doctor, after Mark disappeared, I nearly lost my mind. I was so depressed; I didn't understand why he left me. I thought it was something that I did. But Alex, well, he stole my freedom from me. Twice even. The first time he stole it was when I was pregnant and alone. And the second time he stole it was when my mom died. You know, if she hadn't died, everything would be just fine. Alex would still be having his wonderful life, and I would still be able to do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. But during the pregnancy, I became more and more withdrawn. My friends didn't want to be around me--I was fat and bitchy and always, always in a bad mood.", "input": "", "output": "I think I can understand that. You felt abandoned. What was his explanation? Why did he leave?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he left to protect me. He said that he loved me and that he was certain he was next in line for the firing squad. Mark didn't want me to get hurt or worse. So he left. No note, no phone call, no letter, no anything. I was devastated. By the time Alex was born, I was already back doing drugs. I even tried to kill myself.  That's how I ended up on an extended stay at the Woodside Women's Facility.", "input": "", "output": "You attempted suicide?"}, {"instruction": "I wanted to die. I wanted the baby to die. I didn't have any will to go on without Mark. He was the great love of my life. No one since has ever come close to what he was to me. And I hated him for leaving me. I tried to convince myself that he died. But when I took the pills, I had forced the baby to come. They had to take him out of me before the drugs killed him. That's why I didn't give them the name of the father for the birth certificate. I hated him and wished him dead. And I didn't want his name associated with us. So my mom went and named him Alex Jarrod Rozzi.", "input": "", "output": "Is that significant?"}, {"instruction": "The significance of that, Doctor, is that Jarrod is Mark's last name! My mom said she hated Mark, but she insisted that Alex have a part of his father's name, as remote as it was. This is all too much!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry that you're upset. You're shedding quite a bit of light on some questions that have been floating around in my head for weeks now, and I thank you for your cooperation. I can appreciate how difficult this must be for you."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, Doctor. It isn't like me to get all worked up about things like this. My mascara is probably all over my face by now.", "input": "", "output": "It isn't. You look fine, Larraine."}, {"instruction": "Oh, Doctor! You finally called me by my first name, and I didn't even have to remind you! See? We're getting along just fine. You seem to be a such nice man, Doctor. I'm surprised some girl hasn't snatched you right up! You do like girls, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Rozzi...ah...Larraine, we're not here to discuss my personal life. Let's get back to Alex."}, {"instruction": "Can't blame a girl for trying, can you? You seem like quite a catch to me!", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. Now, can we go on? The story that Mark told you, do you believe it?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't at first. You should have seen me. I was wailing on him big time. I even left some bruises. All that anger and rage was pent up in me for so long, I had to let it out.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Does he want to come back into your life?"}, {"instruction": "Not yet. He has a family up in Canada. A wife and two little girls. Alex has two sisters, can you believe it? But he says that he isn't happy, that he always thought about me and that was why he contacted me. He said that he felt tremendous guilt over leaving me that way and he wanted to clear his conscience and maybe set my mind at ease.", "input": "", "output": "You said not yet.  What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "How could he not want me back? But he's back home in Vancouver for now.", "input": "", "output": "So, is he going to return, then?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes. He really would like to meet and maybe even get to know Alex, on some level.", "input": "", "output": "That's admirable of him."}, {"instruction": "It's getting late, Doctor.  I better...", "input": "", "output": "Just one more thing, Ms. Rozzi.  Do you know if Alex ever made it to his doctor's appointment last week?"}, {"instruction": "I'm almost certain he hasn't. I think he blew that off too, because I was supposed to take him there when he ran off last week.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, that's it for now. Would you like to make another appointment, so we can continue this discussion?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Doctor, I don't really want to make a habit of this therapy stuff.  But perhaps we can get together for dinner sometime? We could talk then?", "input": "", "output": "Like I explained before, I must insist on keeping things on a professional level. I hope you understand."}, {"instruction": "Sorry, Doctor, I didn't mean to offend you.", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't. Now, that appointment?"}, {"instruction": "I'll call you later, when I know what my schedule looks like. Got to run now, I have a hair appointment. See you, Doctor, and do take care! Love that tie!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Larraine."}, {"instruction": "I'm doing pretty good, Doctor. And you?", "input": "", "output": "I'm doing well, thanks. You seem fairly relaxed today. By the way, what happened to you last week? Why did you leave?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't plan to leave like that, but I saw that guy. You know, the paramedic? Sael is his name. He just pulled up in front of the building and looked over at me. He's so nice. And quite a man, too!", "input": "", "output": "I see. So you left with him?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I did. I was kind of pissed that my mom decided to impose herself on us and I didn't want to face her again, you know? Lucky break, having Sael show up like that.", "input": "", "output": "Oh! Before I forget, Alex, here's your wallet. It was found downstairs."}, {"instruction": "That's where it was! It doesn't have anything in it--no money or anything--so I wasn't too upset about losing it. Thanks, man!", "input": "", "output": "You know, Alex, I was somewhat concerned about you. It disturbed me that you left like that, without so much as a word. I would have appreciated if you left me a note, at the very least."}, {"instruction": "I just couldn't take it, man. She's such a bitch. And she's like that all the time. It's too much for me. You've been pretty cool to me, so I won't do that again, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Fair enough. Your mother told me that you had decided to stay with Ralph?"}, {"instruction": "It's true, Doc. For once in her miserable life, she told the truth! Good old Miss Ralph, what a lifesaver! If it hadn't been for that call from him, I'd probably be out in the street somewhere again.", "input": "", "output": "Your mother didn't seem very concerned. I got the impression that she was going to let you stay there as long as you like."}, {"instruction": "That's only because she gets the place to herself. This way, she'll be able to bring over all the men she wants. She hates me, you know?  And I hate her too. The bitch! Plus, as long as I'm at Miss Ralphie's, I don't have to pay for anything. So that's kind of cool, you know?", "input": "", "output": "So you don't have to dance or turn tricks for money."}, {"instruction": "Exactly. It's not like I like to do that--the tricking, that is. I do have a lot of fun dancing, though. But now, Ralph won't let me go in there anymore.", "input": "", "output": "In where?"}, {"instruction": "The club. He owns it. It's where I met him and how I got involved in that strange white bread trick thing. I thought she was a real weirdo at first, but the more I get to know her...she's not so bad after all. Good old Miss Ralphie! Yeah, that club is known for it. It's where anyone, even you, could go to get some young guy to do whatever you want him to do. For money, of course. A lot of the kids pop in there, determined to get a trick. But Ralph found out my real age from my stupid mother, and now he won't let me go in there.", "input": "", "output": "That's probably good, Alex. It could ruin his business if you were caught in there. You mentioned before that you didn't want to do it a lot, just so you could limit the chances of getting caught."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's true enough. I'd hate for Miss Ralph's club to close down.", "input": "", "output": "It's admirable that you're thinking of someone else."}, {"instruction": "What, you think I have no conscience? I care about what happens to people who are good to me. Hey, did my mom try to get you in bed? She moves pretty fast, you know?", "input": "", "output": "No, Alex, she didn't. Your mother's a very interesting lady."}, {"instruction": "That's a good way of putting it! Ha! Ha! Ha! I like the way you said that.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, remember the story you told me about this man, Mark, whom your mom introduced to you as your father?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, it's been on my mind a lot this week. You know, Doc, I think he may really be my biological father. I seem to think that we look alike. Wonder what rock he crawled out from under? It's just the way she handles things, you know? She's so blunt, and it's as if she enjoys pissing me off or something. She won't even tell me about him, really. Well, she won't answer any of my questions about him.", "input": "", "output": "What questions do you have?"}, {"instruction": "Well, for one thing, I'd like to know why she's been keeping this a secret from me for so long. Why didn't she just tell me, you know? It would have been a lot easier for me, if she just came clean and told me the truth. But she's like that, you know? She'll tell you only what she wants to say, just like my grandmother. Whatever is the most convenient story at the time will do. Life would be so much better, if people just didn't lie to me.", "input": "", "output": "I agree with you, Alex. Lies just create more lies and inevitably hurt someone."}, {"instruction": "There's something else I'd like to understand, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "I think that my friends can tell me anything, but they keep things from me, too. Take Benny. He seems not to want to talk to me or even see me anymore. I don't understand...", "input": "", "output": "When did this happen? Did he actually tell you that he feels that way?"}, {"instruction": "No! That's the problem, he won't even talk to me. I've called his house and left a bunch of messages for him. I even went over there a couple of times, and they won't answer the door, and I know that they're home. It started just a few days after I started staying at Ralph's. It bugs the hell out of me. I keep having nightmares about it.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think it is?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know! Hello? Didn't I say that already?", "input": "", "output": "You did. I'm sorry, Alex. Don't get agitated. I was wondering if perhaps you have a clue as to why Benny's acting this way?"}, {"instruction": "Well, a couple of months ago, I noticed that he was looking at me funny--different than normal. He seemed distant too, especially lately. I got the strangest feeling that he didn't like me anymore or something. Then, I figured it was just me, twisting things around in my head the way I do, making myself crazy. But when we had sex, it was like it was brand new each time, you know? He seemed insatiable, like he couldn't get enough. So, because of that, I thought that everything was cool, and that whatever it was that I sensed would blow over. I mean, we're best friends. But when I finally got through on his phone the other day, Dora told me that he wouldn't come to the phone.", "input": "", "output": "Who is Dora?"}, {"instruction": "His wife.", "input": "", "output": "His wife?"}, {"instruction": "That's what I said, his wife.", "input": "", "output": "He's married?"}, {"instruction": "Doc? You need a hearing aid or something?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex.  I just didn't expect Benny to be married.  How old is he anyway?"}, {"instruction": "He's around twenty-three or twenty-four, I'm not sure. He married Dora about three years ago. I begged him not to do it. But he wouldn't listen to me, he did it anyway, knowing that he was queer.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have expectations that your relationship with Benny would evolve into a more intimate one in time?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know what I expected. I expected that he would change his mind. Up until the very last moment they said \"I do,\" I expected him to change his mind. I was still waiting for him to decide that he didn't want to be married, even when he told me that Dora was going to have a baby.", "input": "", "output": "They have a child?"}, {"instruction": "They sure do. A little girl. Roselyn. She's so adorable, looks just like her dad. I was there when she was born, just outside the delivery room. But it really bothers me that he won't talk to me. I wonder what it was that I did.", "input": "", "output": "It might be that it's not your fault at all.  Perhaps, Benny is having difficulties.  I would imagine that living double life is very hard.  Does Dora know the full extent of your relationship with Benny?"}, {"instruction": "She doesn't know, but she has her suspicions. She doesn't even know my age. She thinks I'm older, just like everyone else does. But she's walked in on some questionable activities between Benny and me.", "input": "", "output": "How did you explain it?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't have to. Benny's a master at story telling. He can make anyone believe anything. I've seen him do it many, many times. He dazzles people with his bullshit stories. Sometimes, it's pretty funny to watch! But one time in particular, he just went into an explanation about how men who play professional sports touch each other--like a little pat on the butt or something. And she went for it!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "Over the past sessions you've told me a lot about Benny.  I'm not saying that he's a bad guy, but I believe it wouldn't be above him to use people to achieve his own goals."}, {"instruction": "Benny's not using me! No way! He loves me, I know he does! He's just, he's just...how can you say this to me? I thought you were pretty cool!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex.  But I thought it should be something we consider. Has Benny ever told you that he loves you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes. I mean, no! I mean, I don't know. I can't remember if he did or not. But he doesn't have to say it, he shows it!", "input": "", "output": "By ignoring you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It's all so confusing to me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Why don't we try to figure it out? How do you feel when Benny isn't around? When he's at home with his wife and child? Obviously he can't stay overnight with you. How does that make you feel to know that you have to share him with someone else?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's just that...well, I don't know that I ever really liked the idea. Sometimes, I would cry at the thought of it, you know? The very idea that he was having sex with me, and then going home to her and climbing into the same bed with her and all. It's not fair! I used to tell him that it wasn't, but still I would do it with him. I couldn't bear the idea of him not being around. He's like a father to me, in a way. I mean, most people don't go around having sex with their fathers, but it was more like he was my mentor. He taught me things that otherwise I wouldn't have known. How to do things like working on a car, or painting a house, and stuff like that. He's not a bad person, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't say that he is. But your feelings for Benny seem to be quite different from his feeling for you.  And that's not good.  When this sort of thing happens in a relationship, there's always a lot of pain.  It's demoralizing. It's self-destructive. It's a no win situation, Alex. You can see that, right?"}, {"instruction": "I just figured if I stayed around long enough, that he would have to choose either her or me. But since the baby came into the picture, my chances sort of weakened.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe Benny is making his choice now."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to think of it. The problem is that all he needs to do is be honest with me and just tell me what's going on. It would be easier for me if he did.", "input": "", "output": "But it may not be easy for him. See what I'm trying to say?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's not like I haven't heard it before. Roly has told me this many times already. He thinks I'm crazy to wait around for Benny all the time. He says I'm pining away for him.", "input": "", "output": "Roly may be right. It's something you need to think about. You're not in a very good situation--a lot of people could get hurt depending on what you choose to do. Most importantly, you can be hurt very deeply by this."}, {"instruction": "I know all this, I really do. It's just that I don't think anyone is ever going to love me again the way he does.", "input": "", "output": "Chances are good that you will someday find someone else. And, Alex, you're still quite young and have a lot of time for that to happen."}, {"instruction": "Many fish in the sea, right? Heard it before, man. You and Roly sure think alike.", "input": "", "output": "Think about this some more, Alex, would you? Maybe you should make a list of good things and bad things in this relationship. What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "You know, I've done that already. A couple times. And you know what I came up with? Each time I came up with the same answer--there's more negatives than positives here.", "input": "", "output": "Then you already have your answer."}, {"instruction": "But it's not that easy. I owe him. We belong together.", "input": "", "output": "You don't owe him. It was his choice to help you and to look after you these past years.  You didn't ask him to do that.  He wanted to."}, {"instruction": "I never thought of it that way. He's always been so nice, so good to me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure he has. Alex, before we run out of time, did you get a chance to see your doctor? I notice that your forehead is looking much better."}, {"instruction": "I didn't go to my regular doctor. Ralph has a friend, this old man who used to be a doctor before he retired, and he came over and looked at me. He said I had a bad concussion, but that I would be back in top form in no time. I just have to take it easy for a while. He gave me some Motrin, but I haven't needed to take any of it. I'm feeling a lot better now. If only Benny would...", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. Maybe Benny'll come around and tell you what's going on with him. In the meantime, I still want to urge you to get a physical exam. Are you still experiencing anxiety attacks?"}, {"instruction": "Not like I was. No, not really anymore. Just nightmares. And I've been sleeping more than usual. I think it's because Ralph's place is so quiet compared to mine. He lives on a street that isn't so busy, and the bed I have is huge! He's such a funny man--he still won't even touch me. He doesn't want to have sex with me at all, not even the buttered bread thing. He says he likes me as a son or something.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you're treated well."}, {"instruction": "He does treat me pretty good, you know? Kind of reminds me of my grandfather, only not as old as he was.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that that's going well for you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what I did to deserve it, but I'll take it as long as it's offered.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, we need to wrap things up now."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doctor. See you, man!", "input": "", "output": "Bye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc!", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. You've got some good color--you've been out in the sun? How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "I've been okay, I guess. I'm still pretty upset about Benny, though. It's been on my mind all week, and I've been having trouble again with sleep. So I spent a lot of time walking around the last few nights. Then Ralph took me down the coast for a couple of days during the week. Ralph has this little house in a small town called Bonnie Doon. Ever been there?", "input": "", "output": "No, I haven't heard of it before. It's down the coast?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's a little tiny town tucked away in this old forest near Santa Cruz. It's real pretty and very peaceful. And his house is like a little log cabin. It's way cool! The only problem was that even though it was so quiet and all, I was totally on edge. Even Ralph made a comment about it. We went out to the beach a few times and swam in the ocean. We also hiked up along some cliffs. All that activity and sunshine got to me, and I was able to get to sleep on the last night we were there. That was last Saturday. Then on Sunday, we went to the parade, and that was so fun! Roly came along, too. But Benny was always on my mind.", "input": "", "output": "You had no contact with him at all?"}, {"instruction": "None. But we did run into one of Dora's friends, and she told us that Dora took the baby and left. Roly went over to see Benny on Monday night, and Roly told me that she really is gone. He also told me that Benny still doesn't want to talk to me. It's driving me crazy. When we were at the parade, I saw these religious fanatics protesting and stuff. This one lady had a sign that said something like: \"Gays recruit our youth.\" I was real pissed about it and went straight over to that bitch.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, what did you do?"}, {"instruction": "Well, first of all, I scared Ralph and Roly. They were trying to get me to ignore it or something. But how could I ignore it? It was right there and it called out to me. So I went over to her and asked her to explain something for me. I wanted to know why would all the gay recruiters go only after the ugly guys? Just look around--why are there so many ugly gay guys running around? I mean, if we had the nerve to recruit, did she think that we would pick the ugly ones? Please! If that were true, there wouldn't be a single ugly fag in all the world!", "input": "", "output": "An interesting point, Alex. But somehow I don't see it winning the day with this woman.  So how did she respond to you?"}, {"instruction": "She went off and started yelling and screaming at me--I was poisoned by the Devil and stupid stuff like that. She was way worked up over it, and I thought it was so funny how she reacted. So you know what I told her? I said, \"You must know that what I said is true, otherwise you wouldn't be so upset over it.\" By that time, both Ralph and Roly had kind of wandered out of the immediate vicinity--they didn't want be associated with what could have happened next. I'm like--come on! We would have designed a better system of recruitment, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Did it escalate?"}, {"instruction": "Some other people had gathered around by then, and she was still going on and on--that there was still time to change and stuff. It was impossible. But other people started saying things, and others began yelling, and it turned into a mini riot right there. I just sort of pulled myself away, even though it was lots of fun to watch all these people go at it with each other like that. It was so ridiculous. It's so ridiculous, you know? How stupid and ignorant can people really be? Anyway, I heard that after I left, the police broke it up and carted off some of the people. I guess they got the protesters to leave. Hello? It's not like the protesters were outnumbering the gays. I think they put themselves into a very dangerous spot.", "input": "", "output": "How did you feel after it was over?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I didn't really think about how I was feeling at the time. Right after we had that confrontation, my stomach was all twisting up in knots, and I had that feeling I get--a rushing sensation where my pulse is pounding and my heart is racing. I didn't like some of the names those people called me or the tone. I just walked up to them in a non confrontational way, just in a matter of fact sort of manner.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you thought so.  But those people were protesting and standing up for their beliefs.  Anything you did, from their point of view, would have been interpreted as confrontational.  You see?"}, {"instruction": "You don't actually agree with them, do you?", "input": "", "output": "Of course not. But that's not my point here."}, {"instruction": "Well? Do I have to drag it out of you?", "input": "", "output": "What I'm trying to say, Alex, is that by approaching that woman and questioning her, you put yourself into fairly unpleasant situation and potentially even a dangerous one.  It's important that you think about that before you leap on an impulse to defend your position."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I know. It's just that sometimes my mouth seems to speak on it's own and gets me into situations.", "input": "", "output": "It's certainly something to think over next time, particularly if this is reminiscent of previous experiences you've had."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's funny that you bring this up.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I've noticed that since that night I got the head-butt, I've been leery about things. Apprehensive. I hear my mind telling me not to go in there or do this or that. I find myself less willing to take chances these past few weeks. Even when Ralph and I were hiking, I was hesitating to step forward--I was up on a rock and had a narrow ledge to cross over, but I was all tensed up and couldn't make my feet move. Then I got all shaky, and the heart-pounding thing was going on again, and my palms were sweaty. That's the worst of it--the sweaty palms, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  That can be unpleasent. What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I jumped over it and pushed ahead. Ralph had gotten so far ahead of me by then, that I was even more afraid that I'd lose him. So I just forced myself to do it. I hadn't been there before and when I'm out of the city I have no sense of direction.  I didn't want to find myself lost.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Getting lost would have been a disaster. One time when I was small and my grandma was still alive, I was at the Galleria with her and Aunt Sofie. I must have been five or six, I'm not sure. Anyway, I decided that I was bored, so I went and climbed into one of those clothes racks--you know, the round ones? There's usually a little ledge or bar in the center, and when clothes are hanging on it, I could climb into it and no one would be able to see me. So I did. I climbed right into it and stayed put, watching while all the adults around me were in a panic calling out my name, searching for me. My mom...uh, grandma, was hysterical! It was way funny!", "input": "", "output": "A mischief-maker from way back, eh?"}, {"instruction": "You bet!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, have you talked with your mother this week?"}, {"instruction": "Only once. She called and left messages a few times. She said that Mark was back in town, and that she wanted to see me. I kept ignoring her, even though Ralph said that I shouldn't. So what does she do? She shows up on the front porch the other night. It shocked me to see her that way.", "input": "", "output": "What way?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she had no makeup on, and her eyes were all puffy, like she'd been crying and stuff. She stayed outside for awhile. And then Ralph went out and talked to her. When he came back in, he practically ordered me to talk to her.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "Doc, I've never seen her like that before. It was like...okay, who are you and what have you done with my mother?", "input": "", "output": "What was so different, other than the makeup?"}, {"instruction": "She was actually nice to me. Can you believe it? She was nice for once. I suspected that she was up to her usual crap, but she wasn't. She wanted to talk to me about Mark, and she wanted to tell me what happened.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did she tell you what you wanted to know?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not exactly. What she did do was bring me some photos of her and Mark together. She was my age and he was...it was unbelievable--I look almost exactly like him! She wants me to come home and talk to him, but I don't know. I'm not even sure that I believe any of it--his story, I mean. It's all so out there, you know? A drug dealer, mob hits, and stuff like that. It was so Mission Impossible. I still don't get why they all lied for so long about it. So she had a baby out of wedlock--big deal! She did drugs--ho-hum! I mean, it's like what you and I talked about last week. Everything would be so much easier if people didn't lie about stuff, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I know and I agree. But people do lie, Alex. They do lie. Not everyone and not all the time, but people do. She told you the story and shared some pictures with you. I think this might be a good start for building something more solid with your mother. What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I went into the house after she left and told Ralph to pinch me. I thought I had fallen asleep and was dreaming it all. I guess this guy Mark must have talked some sense into her or something. Hey! I just thought of something. You know, Doc, I sort of lied to you last week about something. I told you that Benny had told me he loved me, but he never has. I told him that I wanted to hear him...someone say that they love me, but he wouldn't do it. One time, he wrote in the sand a big heart with an I in front of it and a U at the end of it, but the water washed it away real fast. Funny how symbolic that seems now.", "input": "", "output": "I see what you mean. Do you believe that he loved you, even though he never verbalized it?"}, {"instruction": "He never needed to, really. He seemed to show it all the time with all the things that he did for me. But now I wonder and I'm perplexed by this sudden estrangement. It doesn't make any sense. It would if we had had a fight or something. But the only thing that stands out for me is that time I told you about--when I noticed something different in his eyes when he looked at me. I sensed then that something wasn't right. But I thought it was just me twisting things around again.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, one thing that I've learned is to pay attention to your gut feelings when you're dealing with other people. I try to follow my instincts and usually, when I do, I find that things work out well for me."}, {"instruction": "I think I'm starting to figure that one out myself. You know what? Ralph told me that he wants me to stay as long as I'd like. He likes my cooking among other things.", "input": "", "output": "You cook?"}, {"instruction": "Had to. Taught myself, too. These past couple of years, if I didn't cook for myself, I would have starved to death. My mom isn't one for regularity, and she's probably the only person I know that's dumb enough to burn water! On Ralph's birthday, I made Beef Wellington with Duchess potatoes. He was so impressed! Cooking comes easy to me. I can't imagine someone screwing up a dish, if they followed the recipe as it was written. Hey, maybe when your birthday comes around, I can make dinner for you? You just tell me what your favorite dish is and I'll make it.", "input": "", "output": "So you're really good.  And you enjoy it..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I do. When I'm in the kitchen, my mind is clear and relaxed, and I feel good accomplishing something like that. Sometimes when I'm out walking around, I stop over at the California Culinary Academy and dream that one day I might go there and become a chef.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Alex, I must say that I'm impressed. I wouldn't have guessed it. Perhaps this is a career path that you ought to consider seriously pursuing."}, {"instruction": "I do think about it, Doctor. But I don't think they'd let someone like me in to that place, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, look at me, Doc. I'm a punk. And I tend to go off sometimes for no good reason.", "input": "", "output": "A lot of the chefs that I know have terrible tempers."}, {"instruction": "So you're saying that I may fit right in?", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps. Don't just dismiss it as an impossibility. This is a good dream you have, Alex, and it would be a shame not to pursue it. You're a very creative individual with a lot of talent and passion. I think you should give serious consideration to trying the culinary field, if you feel the passion for it that you've showed me today."}, {"instruction": "Well, I talked to Ralph about it, and he's taking me to the CCA for the grand buffet Thursday night. I'm so excited. He told me that he asked them if we could tour the school while we're there, and they said they'd take us around the place. I can't wait!", "input": "", "output": "I look forward to hearing your impressions of CCA. It has a wonderful reputation."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, it looks like we're out of time for today. I'd like to urge you once more to get a physical like we discussed previously."}, {"instruction": "Aw, Doctor. I don't really want to. Why do you want me to do that so much?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I think we still need to check on some of the symptoms you've been describing--the racing heart, the anxiety attacks. My job would be easier if I knew your doctor's opinion about all that. Would you please go?"}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it, man. It's just nerves and life and stuff, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I know that's what you think it is. Well, then think about it, okay? And Alex? This was a good session today. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "All right, dude, catch you then!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. Why are you looking at me that way?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm not certain, but something looks different."}, {"instruction": "It's the tan. Or maybe it's the piercings.", "input": "", "output": "That's what it is--you aren't wearing your rings this week. And you aren't wearing the rings on your fingers like you usually do."}, {"instruction": "Well, I decided that since the one in my eyebrow kept getting infected, and I tore the one that was in my nose the other night...see? I decided to take them out for now. I was getting tired of all that crap on my fingers, too. But look at what I did to my nose.", "input": "", "output": "Oh Alex, that looks painful."}, {"instruction": "Pain can be a good thing, Doctor. But no, it's not as painful as it looks. Plus, those guys at the culinary school didn't have any. Wow! You should see that place, it's like a maze in there!", "input": "", "output": "So you enjoyed yourself?"}, {"instruction": "I had a great time. Like I said, it's like a maze in there. We got to take a tour around the school. And this guy was kind of charmed by me, so he took us in the back halls and stuff. We got to see some of the classes going on, and we even met these two French women who are like the school clean-up ladies. They were so cute and sweet. They asked me: \"Ca va?\" And I answered back: \"Ca va bien, merci!\"", "input": "", "output": "Well, Alex, each time I meet with you, you surprise me with something else. You really sounded French there. Where did you learn to speak like that?"}, {"instruction": "My grandmother was Bastille and besides English, she spoke French, Italian, and Arabic, I think. I learned it from her, I guess. But only the French, because that's what she mostly spoke. And also Roly's French, that son-of-a-bitch! But he tells me not to speak it--he says that I massacre the language. Ah, Roly, Roly, Roly!", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "See? Benny's still not talking to me, and I guess he won't be after the other night. But Roly...now, he knows something but he won't talk. I think he knows what's going on in Benny's head and he isn't coughing it up. Ralph pointed out to me that Roly wasn't acting like himself. And then when I started to really pay attention, I noticed that he wouldn't even look me in the eyes.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ask him?"}, {"instruction": "Of course I asked him, but the bastard wouldn't tell me the truth. He kept saying things like: \"That's between the two of you. I can't get involved.\" But I told him that he was involved because he still goes over to Benny's. I got kind of pissed at him and told him that if he really was my friend that he would tell me. But until he does, then he's just one-sided. But I know he has a secret about Benny. I know he does! This is all making me crazy, you know? Remember I told you about the time I noticed that Benny was acting different? Well, I remember there were a lot of clues that were pointing to this happening.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "For one thing, he was looking at me with a strange look on his face, I think I told you that already. Then I started catching him in little lies. Like he told me that he was going to be one place and then he turns up somewhere else. The other thing was that he kept losing his patience with me and everyone else...well not everyone else, mainly Dora and Roselyn. For him to lose his temper like that...well, it just didn't happen before. But the one thing that keeps popping up in my mind is the time he told me I should get into porn.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he's really into watching porn and looking at magazines and stuff like that. But he seemed to be really surprised when I laughed at his suggestion. And then he acted almost disappointed, like he had some kind of plan that was ruined or something.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps he's having a difficult time running his double life. I imagine that it would be very hard to keep it up for very long."}, {"instruction": "Not for him, Doc. He's a master at manipulating people and getting his way. It's who he is, and I accepted that about him a long time ago. But it is more than that. I just can't figure out what more there is, but every day I discover something new.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, when you were talking about the nose ring, you mentioned that something happened the other night.  What was it?"}, {"instruction": "It's stupid, really. See? I went after Roly on Thursday night to see what he would do. That's when he and I argued about Benny. I followed him and guess where he went?", "input": "", "output": "Benny's?"}, {"instruction": "Yup. He went over there. So I climbed around the back gate and propped myself up on the window ledge so I could see what they were doing.", "input": "", "output": "What did you see?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't get a chance to see anything--I lost my balance and fell off, catching my nose on something on the way down. They caught me. They came running out and caught me. Benny was pissed. He wanted to know why I was out there and what I was doing. I told him that I needed to know what was going on. And he said to me: \"What? You think I owe you something?\" And I was like: \"Well, yes. You do owe me something. You owe me an explanation about what's going on here and why you suddenly won't talk to me anymore.\"", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He laughed at me! Like it was all a big joke or something. He laughed at me! I couldn't believe he was acting that way. It was like I didn't matter at all. Like my feelings didn't count, and like I never really mattered to him! I felt this small. It was worse than some of the nightmares I've been getting. My stomach was all pounding, and my heart was up in my throat. And I got so mad that I...I...I just...", "input": "", "output": "Alex, take a moment and try to relax yourself. There's no rush here, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't mean to do it. At least I didn't plan to do what I did! It just sort of happened. I couldn't help myself. I didn't mean to do it!", "input": "", "output": "What happened? Did you damage something?"}, {"instruction": "Only any chance of getting him back. That's what I've damaged. I totally blew it! I got up and grabbed him. And then I threw him against the wall and started to pound my finger in his chest telling him that he wasn't being fair to me, and that I deserved better from him, and I wasn't going to stand around and take this anymore. When he pushed me back, I went off and hit him in the face. And when I did that, he went backwards and hit his head against the wall. He was bleeding, and it got on me and the wall. And he was looking at me like he was all confused and like he wanted to tell me something. I knew that look. It was like he had something to say but he just couldn't or wouldn't. I don't know. But then, he screamed at me to go away and to never come back there again or to call either. He never had used that tone on me before, and it scared me. But what scared me more was what I'd done to him. I just lost it. If Roly hadn't gotten out of the way, I would have probably hit him too! I don't know why...what...oh god, I think I'm going to be sick again!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, here's some water. Please focus on your breathing. Take some breaths and try to relax. You're getting yourself all worked up. I gather the police weren't involved?"}, {"instruction": "No way. Benny doesn't like them, and he wouldn't have called them. That much I know. But now Roly's afraid that I'm coming for him or something, and now he won't take my calls--not that he ever did take my calls. He always let his voice mail pick up the calls and then he wouldn't return calls. But now, he's got my number blocked, so I get this rude recording saying that he won't accept my call!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you're speaking rather fast again. There's no hurry here. I know that this is upsetting to you, but it's important to remain as mindful as possible."}, {"instruction": "What does that mean?", "input": "", "output": "Mindful is what we talked about last time. It's about thinking thoroughly and clearly before taking an action. Weighing out the pros and the cons of a situation. I know it's hard to remember to do that, but you'll find that your actions will be less impulsive that way, and fewer problems will arise. It's about giving yourself a moment to analyze something and then acting accordingly. Some people say to their children: \"Take a timeout.\" That's what being mindful is--taking a timeout and clearing your head."}, {"instruction": "I see. But it's hard for me to do that. Especially when I'm being treated like yesterday's trash. I mean, what did I do to make him treat me this way?", "input": "", "output": "My guess is that he's the one with the problem here. Alex, try to avoid blaming yourself. He may never tell you what went wrong."}, {"instruction": "But see? That's the problem right there. I've got to know. I've really got to know what happened.", "input": "", "output": "But Alex, what if he never tells you what the problem is? As you've just learned, you won't be able to force it out of him. You may never know the answer."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to think about it. He's got to tell me. He just has to!", "input": "", "output": "But it's likely that he won't. At least not now."}, {"instruction": "I can't accept that. I have to know! I have to know why! Oh, I can't talk about this anymore. It's just that I can't let things just hang like this. I just...it's like...I can't go on...oh, no!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, take a deep breath and sit back down. That's good."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, Doctor. It's like I'm losing my mind or something! Why are all the people around me going crazy? Why do people treat me like this? It's all so confusing.", "input": "", "output": "I know, Alex. I understand."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, I think I'd be better off without anyone, you know? Like I could be just fine, if I lived on a deserted island or something. I'm so grateful that I have Ralph, otherwise I'd completely lose it. Oh! I forgot to tell you, I spoke to Mark.", "input": "", "output": "You did? How did it go?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he told me the story of his friend getting murdered. That's why he left my mom here in the city, while he went up to Canada. He told me about his family up there, and he showed me pictures of his girls. I guess he plans to come back to San Francisco for good. Mom said he'll be back in less than a month.", "input": "", "output": "Did he confirm that this is his plan?"}, {"instruction": "Not directly, but I think he's coming back. He seems pretty all right. He told me about some of the trouble he used to get in to when he was my age. He even has a temper like me. When I was talking to him, I felt like I was looking into a mirror--I look exactly like him. It's real weird. But he was cool, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm certainly glad that it went well for you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, me too. I didn't really want to talk to him, you know?  But mom just brought him up to Ralph's without any warning, so I couldn't get away or plan what I was going to say to him. But his girls look a lot like me too, and that got my attention. One day, maybe I'll get to meet those girls--my sisters.", "input": "", "output": "That would be nice."}, {"instruction": "I just wish I could get Benny--and now Roly--off my mind. I've been spending a lot of time with Sael this week. He took me to this nude beach down near Half Moon Bay, and we camped out overnight. It was fun. It helped to get my mind free of those two.  Maybe that's it.  The key.", "input": "", "output": "The key?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Keeping myself busy, doing productive things will help me to ease my mind a bit. It's just the down time that gets to me, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Remember, Alex, you can call me anytime if you need to. Please keep that in mind when you feel that things are getting out of control or too overwhelming, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, thanks. I'll bet we're out of time aren't we?", "input": "", "output": "We are. But I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doctor Balis. You're a good guy! Later on, Dude.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doctor, I think I figured it all out.", "input": "", "output": "Come in, Alex. What have you figured out?"}, {"instruction": "What's going on with Benny, that's what. I went back to his place since we had our confrontation.", "input": "", "output": "You did?"}, {"instruction": "You bet! I was kind of worried about him. You know, after I knocked him down? There was an awful lot of blood. I thought he might be hurt pretty badly. So I went over there the next night, and I sat up on the hill above his house and watched and waited.", "input": "", "output": "What did you discover?"}, {"instruction": "That's the best part, but I'm going to save that for later. Here's what happened. I was sitting up on that hill--he lives on one of those little walkway alleys that connect streets together. His little street was featured in one of those walking San Francisco tour books, because it's so unusual to have these small pathways like we do here. Anyway, I was sitting up there watching his house, and the first night, I saw him come in and go out a couple of times. Then I went back the next night and the next--every night till this past Sunday, I was going over there. Sometimes, I'd just cry outside his place, and other times, I'd just sit there and stare. But he hasn't been there all week, only that first night. At first I thought that he really was hurt, and I was afraid that maybe he died or something.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, mainly because his car was there, and the lights weren't coming on when it got dark. So I decided to go a little closer and I noticed that his papers weren't picked up and that his mail had piled up, too. And then something hit me.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I got this urge to get into his house to see if he was in there or not.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you didn't."}, {"instruction": "I did. I don't know what came over me, but I knew where he had hidden a spare key, and I was really surprised to find it there still. So I went inside and looked around and called out his name, but he wasn't there. He never goes anywhere without his car, at least not for as long as he's been gone.", "input": "", "output": "Did you find out where he was?"}, {"instruction": "That's coming. So I went into his bedroom and laid in his bed for a while, smelling his scent on the sheets and stuff. It was like I was dreaming it all or something--as if I was watching all this on a TV screen. And then, it felt like I hadn't been in there for so long, and I realized again how much I miss him. And then...and then, I found this...oh shit!", "input": "", "output": "What is it, Alex?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's just that history keeps repeating itself on me.", "input": "", "output": "I don't understand."}, {"instruction": "The more I think about all this, the more I feel sick to my stomach--like I want to die. It really hurts, you know? I don't know how much more I can take.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I must ask you this--are you feeling suicidal?"}, {"instruction": "Fuck, no! I'm not thinking about killing myself, although the idea of a meteor or a bolt of lightening striking me down has been appealing to me. But, no, I don't plan to kill myself. So after, I went home and got into the shower. And, I swear, if I had a Brillo pad, I would have scrubbed myself down with it!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I'm sorry, but I'm not following you."}, {"instruction": "I felt so dirty and totally disgusted with myself. If I never have sex again, it'll be fine with me. It's like all I could think of was to get the shit off of me or out of me or something, I don't know. It reminded me of the guy who held a knife to my throat, and how I felt after he did it the first time--like I wanted to boil his scent off me. But no matter how much I washed, or how hot the water was, it wasn't enough to get rid of it, you know? I'm fucking tainted, Doctor. He's fucking ruined me forever.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I need you to slow down, because I think I missed something here. What happened to you to make you feel this way? What did you find at Benny's?"}, {"instruction": "It's real embarrassing. I found some videotapes. A couple with Roly's name on them, and a few with my name on them. Can you guess what they were?", "input": "", "output": "Please tell me."}, {"instruction": "They were videotapes of Roly and Benny having sex. And others were tapes of me and Benny having sex. Only I never knew that he was taping it, and it looked like Roly didn't know either. They were taken a long time ago. It was obvious that Roly was real young when they were made.", "input": "", "output": "Oh no, Alex. What did you do then?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't play them while I was there, I took them home with me and watched. And then, I flew into a rage. I feel like I was used, and there were other tapes there, too, with names I didn't know! I felt disgusted with myself, dirty. He used me, Doctor Balis, he used me.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I'm very sorry."}, {"instruction": "You're sorry? Shit, man, I'm fucking more than sorry. I want to get my hands on him again and really hurt him now! That scum! But wait! There's more! Oh shit, now I sound like one of those announcers on TV trying to sell you a Ginsu knife set or something! But there's more.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "I went over to have a little talk with Roly, because I never knew that he and Benny were lovers. But I could tell that it must have happened before I ever came along. I wanted to know what he knew about all this, and where the hell Benny was hiding.", "input": "", "output": "Did you get to talk with him?"}, {"instruction": "He told me more than I ever bargained for. Lucky for him, I brought Ralph along. Because if he hadn't been there, I think I might have killed him. What he told me was that Benny is now in jail, and that there were more tapes somewhere.", "input": "", "output": "What is he in jail for?"}, {"instruction": "He got arrested because he apparently molested some twelve-year-old boy, and the police had found some Polaroids of this kid in Benny's wallet--pictures that proved he did it. The fucker is a pedophile! A damned pedophile! He likes little boys! Doctor, can you believe it? Little boys, for God's sake! Roly told me that the reason Benny didn't want me around anymore is because for one thing, I'm too old for him now, and for another thing, I wasn't willing to do the porn thing--I was too smart for my own good.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm..."}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "Well, what do you plan to do now?"}, {"instruction": "Plan? What do you mean? I haven't been able to even see straight, let alone plan anything! All I can think about is how disgustingly sick this all is, and how dirty I feel.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. It's a normal reaction to the shock of discovering what you've found out. Alex, you were being molested by him yourself. You're right--he was using you, and you were once that twelve-year-old boy, too. Alex, you have the tapes to prove it."}, {"instruction": "No way! No fucking way! I'm not going to do that! You can't make me do it, you can't! I won't let anyone see those tapes! No one!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, Benny's a sick individual who should be in jail. I think you'd be doing his future victims a big favor by turning these tapes over to the authorities."}, {"instruction": "No way! I won't do it! I can't turn him in, can't you see that? I love him, he took care of me.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, have you ever heard of situations in which a victim identifies with his or her perpetrator?"}, {"instruction": "You mean like when a hostage comes out saying that the kidnapper was justified in doing what they did?", "input": "", "output": "Exactly. Looking at it from the outside--objectively--Benny took advantage of you. You said it yourself--he used you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I know he did. I knew what he was doing, and I let him do it because I liked it. Plus, I was getting the attention that I craved since my grandma died, and which I wasn't getting it at home. You know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "I do understand, Alex. If you'd been getting the affection you needed and deserved at home, then you'd have a different view about Benny and what he did to you. He took you out of a situation where you were prematurely introduced to sex, and he continued to nurture the sexuality that you'd already been exposed to. Your body was reacting the way it was designed to do--with pleasure. That's not wrong, Alex, that's normal. You responded that way because nature intended for you to experience pleasure when certain physical stimulus is applied. Do you understand?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. I never thought about it that way before. I always thought I liked it. But a lot of the times, I really didn't want to do it. I just did it to make him happy. And then afterwards, I felt like shit about it.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, Benny did something really bad to you.  It's as bad as if he attacked you with a knife or something."}, {"instruction": "You want me to turn him in.  But I don't know if I can do that to him, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Well, let me put it to you this way, Alex. If you do nothing and he gets out of jail, what's to stop him from picking out some other young child and doing to him what he's done to you?"}, {"instruction": "That's not my problem. Although, with someone like Benny loose, I'm beginning to think that the only virgin left in San Francisco is an ugly three-year-old!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I know you well enough by now to know that you don't really mean that. Could you do nothing, knowing that he will do it again?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "At the very least, Alex, you should put the tapes back in the house where you found them.  The police are bound to search his residence at some point prior to his trial.  If they find the tapes, then you won't have turned Benny in.  You just left things as they were."}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it.  But I don't want anyone seeing the tapes of me, that's for sure.  This is overwhelming me. My head is spinning, and it hasn't stopped since this all came down. Shit! I haven't slept at all since the other night when Roly told me the truth. Look, my hands are even shaking. I can't even relax because of this.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you do seem to suffer from a bit of insomnia at times. I can give you something that would help you sleep--so you can get some rest. How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't like that idea. Drugs? You want me to do drugs?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, there's a medication I can prescribe to you that will have a calming effect and allow you to get some rest. Your rest is the most important thing right now, because without proper rest you'll continue to be disoriented and charged up. The medication I have in mind is called quazepam. It's not a dangerous drug, and it has few side effects. I can prescribe it in a small dosage."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It scares me to do that, you know?", "input": "", "output": "You fears are warranted. But trust me, Alex, I wouldn't offer this to you if I didn't think it would help. As I said, it's important for you to get some rest. Here, I'll write it out for you, and you can take it downstairs to Dick in the pharmacy. He'll fill it for you now. I'd like for you to get some sleep."}, {"instruction": "Well, I won't promise you that I'll take it. But I'll go have it filled anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Take it when you can't sleep, but don't take more than one, even if it doesn't work.  Try to avoid drinking coffee or smoking cigarettes, especially at night.  Here you go and please call me if you have any problems or questions about the medication, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "See you next week, then."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Alex?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry that I'm so much trouble.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Alex! Don't ever think that you are trouble to me. You're a good person, and you deserve a lot better than what you've been given. I think that you've done remarkably well. Try not to worry so much, Alex. Things will improve, they really will."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, man. See you later.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Right now, I think I'm still on hold or something. I don't know, not bad, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by \"on hold?\""}, {"instruction": "I guess I'm kind of numb still. It's hard to describe how I feel...if I feel anything right now--still repulsed, maybe? I don't know. But I've been able to get some rest. Oh yeah and I quit smoking. I didn't even need to take those pills you gave me, which works for me. But I decided to throw out my smokes, once and for all.", "input": "", "output": "That's a positive step. What made you decide to quit?"}, {"instruction": "Well, old Miss Ralphie doesn't smoke anymore. He's funny. He says to me, \"Why spend all that good money on cigarettes, when I can go down to the club and breathe some second-hand smoke for free?\" I told him that it's not exactly for free--he's actually getting paid to breathe it since he owns the place!", "input": "", "output": "It's nice to see you've retained your sense of humor."}, {"instruction": "Laughing at the dumbest things is the only thing right now saving me from running down to that jail and kicking Benny's butt myself. But I've heard that someone did it for me already. Lucky break for him--I'd really have hurt him.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean? What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, in case you didn't already know, they don't like pedophiles in jail very much. They think it's the ultimate sick thing to do. After all, there's some general etiquette to life that those guys hang onto, and child crimes are the numero uno taboo! Yeah, Roly told me he got beat-up pretty badly. He had to spend a couple days in the jail's hospital or something. Now, they've got him somewhere where no one can get to him, I think. It's a mess, Doctor--a huge big mess. And I still don't know what I'm going to do. Marney told me not to get involved with him in the first place. And now, she's not even acting like she's judging me or anything--no \"I told you so's\" or anything like that. She just thinks that it's better that I wash my hands of it all.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Who is Marney? I haven't heard you mention her before."}, {"instruction": "Marney's like the big sister I didn't have. She was my babysitter when my grandparents were still alive--when I was small. Her family moved to France about three years ago. My grandma used to call her parents' \"jet-setters\", because they were all over the place. But Marney's not really very much older than me, and she used to come over and play with me and stuff. She was always someone who I admired, because she's so wise. I still admire her.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I heard the doorbell ring and ran down to answer it thinking it was Ralph forgetting his keys, but there she was standing there. I'm like, \"How did you find me?\" It was such a big surprise, you know? My mom gave her the address. Since she's been here, I've been laughing my head off. The other night, we were in this little club over on Polk Street, and this man comes in completely blasted out of his mind and reeking of booze. He didn't look like a typical drunk; he looked more like a businessman out to blow his own mind. So anyway, he comes in and sits at the table next to us all sloshed and starts talking to us. Marney--being the fun-loving girl that she is--engages him in conversation for awhile. And we're all talking, and then suddenly, he gets this look on his face, looks around a little, leans over, and asks us if we knew where to get a good TV. Marney, in her own classic style, takes a drag off her smoke and kind of points with her thumb. And with a smile she says: \"There's a Circuit City right up the street!\" And the man goes like, \"No, I mean a Tee Vee!\" He said it real drawn out this time and a lot louder, and people were starting to look. So I asked him if he meant a video monitor or something. But he was getting perfectly pissed, so he stood up and said: \"No, god damn it--a TV, a god damned TV! Doesn't anyone know where I can find a girl with a penis?\" And he raged out of the place in a stupor carrying on like that. We could still hear him out there ten minutes later! I think I still hear him now! It was priceless!", "input": "", "output": "That's a very interesting story. Sounds like you're enjoying seeing Marney again, Alex. I want to ask you about the tapes."}, {"instruction": "You mean the ones I found in Benny's apartment?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. If you hang onto them, there is a good possibility that they will be discovered by someone else. Those tapes are evidence against Benny.  If someone finds them in your possession..."}, {"instruction": "You think they would think that I'm involved with them, too?  Like I helped to make them or something? Hmm. I hadn't thought about it like that. That's an interesting way of thinking about it. So what you're saying is that I should destroy them?", "input": "", "output": "Oh no, Alex, not destroy them. I suggest that you turn them over to the police."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, man. Like I told you before, I still haven't decided what to do. But those ones with me and Roly on them...well, I kind of already destroyed them. I had a little symbolic fire in the backyard. And I did go back to Benny's house and got the others--the ones that were left before the police went over there. And I had a nice little bonfire going there for awhile, too. God, it smelled awful. I don't recommend burning any plastic, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'll try to avoid it. Alex, you mentioned that you had some other tapes. Where do you have them now?"}, {"instruction": "Why do you want to know that?", "input": "", "output": "I'm concerned that if you're keeping them hidden at Ralph's house, it could easily be misinterpreted and Ralph could be accused of being a child pornographer."}, {"instruction": "Good point, Doctor. Hey, that well-rounded education you have is starting to pay off. Sometimes, I'm about as sharp as a meatball, you know? Marney says I should have been a blonde. Should of, would of, could of! She's so funny. But you know, that really is a good point about the tapes. I need to do something with them, but I don't know how to explain how I got them. I mean, it's not like I can go into the police and tell them that I just broke into Benny's house and stole them while he was in jail, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Well, Alex, I've always found that the truth is the easiest in the long run. If you decide to give them to the authorities, tell them what you told me--you had a key to Benny's house and you wanted to see if he was there. When you found these tapes, you didn't know what to do so you took them with you. How does that sound?"}, {"instruction": "It's too easy. I don't know about this. I guess I need to think about it some more. Maybe I'll talk to Marney and Ralph about it a little more, too. I already told you what Marney thinks, and Ralph is so pissed at Benny that he wants to take the tapes down himself. He even threatened to do it, if I don't.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I certainly think it's something to seriously consider. Perhaps if you do that, Benny'll get an opportunity to get some help. Some people can't or won't get help without outside intervention. Sort of like how you found yourself here in my office in the first place."}, {"instruction": "I see what you mean--like forcing it on him or something.", "input": "", "output": "I suppose that's another way of saying it, yes."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I almost completely forgot about this. Remember when my house got broke in to? Well, I think it was Benny who did it.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when I got home that day and found the place all messed up, the mess looked as if it was focused on the entertainment center in the living room and on my videotapes and stuff. According to Roly, Benny had been frantically searching for this videotape, and he thought that either Roly or I had picked it up by mistake. He knew that I would get suspicious, I guess. But when he found out that Roly didn't have it, he came looking for it at my place and still didn't find it. Guess who had it? His wife Dora did, and that's why she took the kid and got out of there.", "input": "", "output": "What was on the tape? Was it you?"}, {"instruction": "No way, thank God. It was that kid he molested. After Dora found it, she gave it to the police. The police found this kid and talked to him, and the rest is history. It was the proverbial nail in his coffin. I'm so glad I had the sense to take back my drawings when I was there getting those tapes.", "input": "", "output": "You have some drawings?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I do. It's something that I do to escape reality, I guess. I made these drawings of cars for Benny, as gifts--he's such a car enthusiast. I had to get them back, you know? I think they mean a lot more to me than they ever did to him, the jerk. I wish I could get my hands on him, you know? I'd really give him what he deserves--no law is going to give him just punishment. They should just turn him over to me, and I'll take care of the details. It should be like the old days, you know? Where the criminal is strung up in a public square somewhere. And in my fantasy, his victims...or his victims' families...or both would get a few swings each at him with a big baseball bat with spikes on the end. Yeah! And red pepper sprinkled on the spikes, so when they pierced his skin, it would burn even more. Yeah! And then, the rest of the public would go at him till there's nothing left but pulp. Yeah, that sounds real good to me! Oh, yeah! What I wouldn't give up to get my moment with him.", "input": "", "output": "That's very graphic, Alex. Do you draw some of these fantasies?"}, {"instruction": "Would you want to look at it?", "input": "", "output": "Of course, I would. I'm very interested in seeing your work. Would you bring me some?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, I never have done anything too horrible--no blood and guts or other gore. I just save all that for ears and imaginations. I saw it was working on you! Ha, ha! You really got a funny look on your face, when I was talking about my fantasy public flogging session on Benny. But my artwork is kind of plain--pen and ink stuff mostly. But I'm starting to branch out into color more. Wow! I'm really surprised that you'd want to see any of it. I mean you are...what's the word? Cultured. You seem like someone who has discriminating tastes.", "input": "", "output": "You make me sound so stuffy. But yes, I really do want to see some of it. Would you mind?"}, {"instruction": "Mind? I'd love to show you some of it! No one has ever shown any interest in anything like that with me. Except for Marney, that is; she always inspires me somehow. I remember this drawing that she did one time, and I wish we could find it again--it was so cool. She drew a Scrabble board in color pencils. It had her ashtray with a lit cigarette in it, and I think there was a joint or a pipe, I can't remember exactly. And she even drew in a mirror with lines of coke on it--for effect, she said, because neither of us has ever done coke. But it was the coolest thing, and I loved it and was awe struck by her imagination and skill. It totally impressed me. But, yeah, I'll bring you some stuff to look at. Maybe, I'll even give you something if you want.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Alex. I look forward to seeing your work. Well, it seems we have run out of time."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doctor. You aren't as stuffy as I made you sound, but you know how it is? It's a generational kind of thing, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. That's an interesting thing you've done to your hair. Are those a new form of dreadlocks?"}, {"instruction": "Oh this? I almost forgot I did it. Yeah, it's some kind of dread-thing going on up there. You like it, I can tell.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it certainly is...interesting."}, {"instruction": "It's okay. I mean I didn't do it for you, anyway. Here, I brought these for you, though, like I said I would. These are a couple of my drawings that I got back from Benny's place.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks. Let me take a look at them later.  Right now, I'd like to know what's been going on with you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. Sometimes, I feel like I'm defeated or something--like no matter what I do it's not right, or enough, or maybe it's just not working or something. I don't know how I feel. I'm confused. I'm pissed off at everything and everyone. About the only thing that seems good is mom, if you can believe that. Oh, and also Mark is back now with his two girls, Rhea and Racyl--my little sisters. But my mom has transformed. It seems like it's all a dream to me or something. Especially the way she's been acting.", "input": "", "output": "Why? What has your mother been doing?"}, {"instruction": "Well, last week--the day I saw you actually--when I got home to Ralph's, my mom was waiting for me. She was hysterical--all tears and makeup running down her face and stuff. She was like, \"Alex, I'm so sorry. So, so sorry.\" I was just standing there looking at her--this was real \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" shit and all. Someone change the damn channel or something, this is getting thick! But she was all crying and being this blubbering fool, trying to hug me. And it was all so sick--her being like that.", "input": "", "output": "What was wrong? Why was she sorry?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the San Francisco Police Department paid her a visit. They were looking for me, and I guess they spilled the beans to her on good old Benny.", "input": "", "output": "She didn't know what happened..."}, {"instruction": "Exactly. And of course she believed it, because the police said so and there was evidence to prove it. But if I told her about it, she wouldn't have believed me, just like she didn't before. She'd have called me a liar and told me to get out of her face. But now that the police told her...well, shit! Those guys lie more than I ever did, but that's not the point. You'd think that when a little kid tells his mother that some freak is raping him with a knife to his throat that the mother would consider her kid's comment as possibly true or something, you know? Why would I want to tell her about Benny? She would have just dismissed me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. But you said that she's transformed. Do you believe her tears were genuine?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's only part of it. She really seemed like she was sorry. She was trying to get me to come back home and all. She was being nice to me, and not in a condescending way either. It was like she was actually showing me some kind of respect or something, I don't know. I've been waking up with a start after having either one of my nightmares or a dream about her looking like the \"Leave it to Beaver\" mother. That idea scares the hell out of me! Imagine that!", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to tell me about these nightmares? What's going on there?"}, {"instruction": "After the police finally got to talk to me, I started having nightmares about Benny. But that's not what they are about. Or maybe they are--it's hard to tell what they are all about.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "The one dream that has stuck to me is where I'm looking for Benny. In this dream, I'm not mad at him, I'm just searching for him. And it's foggy outside. But I'm walking through this over-grown garden or something. I think it's his backyard, because I come upon this cottage like thing--more like a garden teahouse in England--and it's all covered with thick vines and stuff. I walk inside after pushing back this door. Benny does have a little teahouse-thing in his yard, by the way, but it's set up like a gym inside and it's not covered by anything like what I saw in my dream. So anyway, I go inside and it's set up like his gym just like in real life. But in this dream, it's all lit up with these tall hooded lamps like the ones they use on a movie set. And there're all these people in there. I start asking for Benny, and they all point in the direction of a person sitting in the movie director's chair with his back to me. Oh, I don't know, Doc. This is pointless, really. It has nothing to do with what it seems like it should. It isn't important.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. Please, go on."}, {"instruction": "It's kind of stupid, actually. It really is. Well, okay. This place inside is huge--it's like ten times bigger than what it really is. So as I go up to see Benny, I notice that the lights are getting brighter and the people are fading out of view, but I could still hear them talking and stuff. You know, as I'm telling you this, my stomach is getting all tight or something--like it's gurgling. Oh, I think I may be getting sick.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, take a moment and try to relax. That's it. Now, slow your breathing down. That's right. Take it slowly. There. Now, take your time. Remember, this is only a dream, and you're here with me now and you're safe."}, {"instruction": "But that's the problem, Doctor--I don't feel safe. Anywhere. I feel like I blew it and that I can't even seem to look anyone straight in the eyes. I think that everyone knows what I did. There's like a mark on me or something. My shoulders hurt.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. But believe me--you're safe here. Look around.  Look at me.  Try to internalize that this is a very safe place for you, Alex.  Alex?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know anymore. Is anyone safe? Is anyone? Oh, no...", "input": "", "output": "Here, Alex. The tissues are right here."}, {"instruction": "See what I mean? Look at me! Just look at me. I'm all crying and I can't even sit in the chair right. Even Marney was trying, in her own way, to get me out of the \"ball,\" as she says it, that I curl up into lately. It's almost like it's unconscious or something. It's how I awoke after the nightmare I was telling you about. And now, it seems like I can't get comfortable in any other position. I feel like I don't want to take up too much space or something. I don't know. I just don't know what I'm talking about, see? I hate it. I hate myself. That stupid dream--I hate it too! So in this dream, I'm walking up to Benny to see if he's all right, because I'm remembering that I pushed him and hurt him. I'm noticing that the floor is wet--entirely covered in dark liquid. It looks like blood, but it isn't the right color. It's all over the place. As I get closer to him, it seems like I have to walk far just to get close to him. And then I hear this voice, and it's yelling at me, telling me things like, \"Sit up. Stop acting like a girl, ya little sissy! Stop your damn whimpering. What's the matter with you?\" Things like that. This really scares me. But then he turns around and looks at me, and it isn't Benny.", "input": "", "output": "Did you recognize who it was?"}, {"instruction": "I did. It was my dad...or my grandfather. What the fuck? He was my dad. It was the only way I knew him, as my dad. So he turns, looks at me, and starts insulting me--making me feel like I was nothing, the way he used to do. And then he gets up and reaches for me. I push him away and I run and run for what seems like eternity. And as I get to the door, he's standing there, laughing. That's all I remember. I woke up in a cold sweat screaming that night. Ralph came into my bedroom and was all freaked out. He said I was yelling and screaming in my sleep. I haven't been able to do anything normal since then. It just completely freaked me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Have you thought about what this dream might mean?"}, {"instruction": "I told you already, damn it! Shit, you're not paying attention to me! Jeez, why did I waste all that on you? If this is all too much for you, then I can just walk right out of here!", "input": "", "output": "No, Alex. Please, sit down. I was listening to you. But what I want to know is have you thought about what these images and events in this dream might mean? Have you tried to put any of it together?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I put it together all right--I'm a totally fucked up person. I can't even imagine someone touching me again--I feel dirty, used up or something. I'm no use to anyone, not even myself. Shit, my dad told me that from the beginning--no good.", "input": "", "output": "How did your grandfather treat you?"}, {"instruction": "He wasn't my goddamn grandfather!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, your father. Was he like this with you?"}, {"instruction": "It's what I remember most about him. He used to yell at me, or my grandmother, or both all the time. If he wasn't yelling, someone was checking to make sure he was still alive. That's why he had a heart attack and died. He was yelling, and screaming, and ranting, and raving when it hit him. Got what he deserved, as far as I'm concerned. You know what reminded me of him? It was that damn lawyer, Cecil. He's the one who reminded me of it all.", "input": "", "output": "I don't know about Cecil.  How did he remind you of it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's the other part of what my mom is up to. After she understood what went down with Benny, she apparently had a talk with Ralph behind my back--he's up shit-creek with me for that! But he told her about the tapes and gave them to her. She gave them to Cecil. And then I had to go and talk to him about them. Then he gave the tapes to the police. Then the police came back to talk to me--it never ends, it never ends.", "input": "", "output": "I think this might be for best, Alex.  I know you're angry at Ralph now, but his goal was perfectly understandable. It may have saved you and him from any more trouble."}, {"instruction": "It's done now. Can't change it. But I didn't like the fact that he did it without my knowledge, and he knows I'm not happy about it. He's trying to be his nice old self--no strings, no spider-webs, no interfering.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think he had any choice, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I guess so. But I don't like the way he did it.", "input": "", "output": "Did it ever occur to you that perhaps your mother was more involved with this than you realize?"}, {"instruction": "Well, now there you go again! Hello? Seems like this week, you're the one who's as sharp as a meatball! That's exactly why it happened the way it did. And that's why I'm not out in the street somewhere, running away from Ralph and everything and everyone else. My mother worked her wiles on him, and he fell right into it. That's one thing that will never change about her--when she wants something, she usually figures out a way to get it. Unless it's a man--she can get a guy to do anything for her except get him to stay with her.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps your mother manipulated Ralph into giving her these tapes. But was that such a bad thing? She was trying to protect you, to look out for you. Maybe she's trying to be a good mother to you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's sick, you know? She's a psychopath. Pretty scary stuff, eh? But I'm not going to move back into that house, you know? She's got Mark and Racyl and Rhea. And now Marney's there, too. I don't really want to be the Brady Bunch. With aunt Sofie coming home from the hospital soon, she'll be there as well. No way. Ralph's is just fine. It's peaceful and solitary. I don't need any more shit, you know?", "input": "", "output": "No, you don't.  But having a large family is not as bad as you think it is.  I won't discourage you from staying with Ralph, but ultimately I think you'd be better off with your family. Alex, I'd like to suggest something to you. There's a few books on the subject of molestation..."}, {"instruction": "I don't know about that, man. That's some serious stuff there, you know?", "input": "", "output": "And what happened to you wasn't?"}, {"instruction": "Touch\u00e9, Doctor, touch\u00e9.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you are, like everyone else, deserving of respect and happiness. What happened to you in your life is not what most people experience. You handled it all very well, considering your circumstances. You should give yourself credit for that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah...and tomorrow is another day, and one step at a time, and all that other bullshit, right?", "input": "", "output": "No.  That's not what I've said.  Alex, horrible things happen.  It's unfortunate that they've happened to you.  But they have.  And what you need to do now is learn how to live your life despite what happened to you.  You're describing a very low self-esteem, feelings of disgust about yourself, and even self-hatred.  Those are common reactions of molestation victims. So we're going to try to work those emotions through and get to the other side.  And you know, Alex?  There is another side.  It might not feel like that right now, but someday..."}, {"instruction": "Hey, I don't come here to be lectured. I could go to my mom's house for that, I'm sure.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. But I want you to start noticing each time you put yourself down, each time you ridicule yourself, and each time you feel like you don't deserve to be loved.  And each time you notice those emotions, try to remember and tell yourself that those feelings are not justified and that you deserve as much love and respect as everyone else."}, {"instruction": "Well, I can't help feeling the way I do right now. It's just the way things are. But I know we've run out of time, so I'll be on my way. Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Alex? Just try, okay? And please don't hesitate to call me if you need anything, okay? I'm just a phone call away."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, man. Hey, I'm sorry I'm being such a dick; I know you're just trying to help.", "input": "", "output": "No problem, Alex. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis! How are you?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex, I'm fine.  You seem cheerful--quite a difference from last week."}, {"instruction": "Well, you know how I was feeling last week? And then after what happened to Roly...well, I decided that I had had enough, you know? I couldn't take it anymore. Now I feel like a huge heavy weight--the heaviest weight you can imagine--has been lifted from my shoulders. So I went out and took care of it.", "input": "", "output": "I don't follow you, Alex. Took care of what?"}, {"instruction": "Don't ask.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do? What about Roly? What happened to him?"}, {"instruction": "I told you not to ask! I knew you would. Oh, well. I'll tell you one thing--now I know why I don't drink or do drugs.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Because last week--I think it was Thursday--I got a call from Dora, if you can believe it. She told me that Benny is now in a mental hospital or something. He tried to commit suicide by hanging himself, only it didn't work--it just landed him in a psycho ward. It's rock bottom for him. Rot in hell Fucker! So anyway...last week, I was feeling real low, like the bottom had dropped out from under me, too.", "input": "", "output": "I was very concerned as well--you weren't yourself last week."}, {"instruction": "I'll say I wasn't, that's for sure. So on Thursday after she called me, I went down to the park to do my routine, you know? And Cal and I--he's my foreman, I guess--we get into it something fierce. I was screaming and yelling and in a total rage over something that was my fault anyway. But I just had to take it out on him, for some reason. And it's not the first time either, with him that is. I walked away from that feeling like a total jerk, and I went out with Roly that night and had a party.", "input": "", "output": "A party?"}, {"instruction": "Don't remind me. My head still hurts. Yeah, a party! We went out together, and I decided that I wanted to get drunk. So Roly and I go over to the teahouse in Benny's yard. You know what's funny? He, Roly, had a dream similar to mine about that place--go figure. Anyway, we went inside and drank a bottle of Cuervo I swiped from Ralph's bar. Roly had some dope, so we smoked that, too. And then I got the bright idea of getting into the garage.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What happened in the garage?"}, {"instruction": "Well at first, I thought that pouring sugar in the gas tank would be enough, but they don't usually keep sugar in the garage. So that was a dumb idea. And then I saw the sledgehammer.", "input": "", "output": "Oh no!"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes! The sledgehammer. It was exhilarating. And exhausting, too. We took turns smashing Benny's car into bits and pieces. Man! Glass was flying everywhere. We were both screaming at the top of our lungs, my throat hurt for three days after. When it was over, I realized we weren't alone. Dora was standing just outside watching us and crying and crying and crying. I had never seen her that way before. She looked like a little girl just standing there, her hand hanging that way--she was holding one arm with her other hand. It was so sad. Then we all started to cry. It was a group cry. Sounds mushier than it was though. She told us she forgave us. She explained to us that she knew that we didn't mean to hurt anyone. She said that we need to forgive Benny. Well, the idea of forgiving him is just a little too soon for me right now, you know what I mean? And Roly! He was ballistic at the thought of it--ready to go totally postal, you know?", "input": "", "output": "That's perfectly understandable. But I do think that Dora is right.  You will have to learn to accept what happened to you and Roly so you can move on with your life, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I know, but it's still too soon. So don't push it, okay?", "input": "", "output": "I won't. It sounds like it was good to see Dora--you got some form of positive closure from it. The trashing of the car though...well,  you know what I think about that."}, {"instruction": "I agree. It was a childish, destructive thing to do.", "input": "", "output": "Couldn't have said it better myself."}, {"instruction": "Yeah? But I'd do it again in a second, you know? He deserves a lot worse.", "input": "", "output": "From what you told me, he's getting a lot worse now. But that's not your problem anymore, Alex.  Feeling better, getting yourself together and under control is. And it seems like you are feeling much better now, and maybe even more confident?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure what it was exactly, but I think Roly had a lot to do with it. He was pretty upset at the idea of forgiving Benny--he was taking it all much worse than I from the beginning. But I hadn't noticed it, because I wasn't spending much time with him. So he's all explosive and everything, and Dora went back into the house--she didn't even care about Benny's car, you know? She didn't even care about it. I think she enjoyed it as much as we did. But I got Roly out of there, and we went down to the bridge and climbed up on one of those beams under it. We just sort of hung for awhile, listened to the traffic, and felt the vibrations of the bridge from all those cars. Roly decided that he was going to freak on me right then and there, you know? And I was like, \"Okay, Dude, get a hold of yourself. You're going to make us fall, you know?\"", "input": "", "output": "You were under what bridge?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean, what bridge? The Golden Gate Bridge! You think I'm going to climb up underneath the Bay Bridge? That bridge is disgusting! No, there's this place that we know on the San Francisco side where you can get to these support beam-things--they aren't really the bridge part, but they support the cables and stuff, I guess. So Roly was all freaking, and I was trying to get him to come down only I couldn't. And pretty soon, other people were noticing that he wasn't all together there. I guess someone called the police, and they came and took him away for being a public nuisance and for public drunkenness. But you know what the worst part of it was? After they took him away, I was left there by myself to sit and think about what was going on. I sat there most of the night, I think, and I decided that I had had more than enough--I wasn't going to sit around and self-destruct like Roly just did right before my eyes. But I had hurled my lungs out at least seventeen times. And, man, were my innards dry and sore! So I decided to do two things this week. One was to apply for and pass the GED, so I can avoid going back to that damn school. The second was to find some way to get myself into a creative schooling thing--say the culinary school or an art school or something. The only thing holding me back is my age, but mom got Cecil to help me figure out what we can do.", "input": "", "output": "Well, this certainly turned into a positive story. I'm very happy to hear that you've managed to turn all of this around for yourself."}, {"instruction": "There is still a lot of shit to go through, you know? Cecil is helping me with the legal stuff, like he did with my...ah, grandparents. I'm going to be a witness at Benny's trial, and it looks like he'll be behind bars until then. So I'm okay with that. I hope that Roly gets his shit together by then, too. They got him in some place down in Belmont. Oh, and I may be going back to my house after all, but that's still a way off.", "input": "", "output": "I'm surprised.  You were so against the idea of living with your mom and the whole family. What made you change your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Well, for one thing, Ralph's kind of pissed off at me for not coming home that night when Roly went off. I told him to not to act like that with me, but he does it anyway--he acts like he's my keeper or something.", "input": "", "output": "In a way, Alex, he is your keeper. You live in his house right now, and you should let him know where you are so he doesn't worry about you. That's probably why he's mad at you."}, {"instruction": "Well, not exactly.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I had another fight. After I finally got home, Ralph was in his own little rage. \"Hadn't slept all night,\" he said. And I do understand why he was worried--I flew out of the house that night pissed off at him for something else, I can't remember what now, but it was something. He said that when I went out the door, that a picture came off the wall and broke. It belonged to his mother, and he was hurt that it was now broken. So I was thinking that maybe this set up isn't going to work forever. And also now that I have these two little sisters who need me to watch over them in this big city...well, it makes sense to be closer to them, you know?", "input": "", "output": "This has been an interesting week for you, hasn't it? Tell me more about your sisters."}, {"instruction": "Well, Racyl is thirteen, and Rhea is twelve. They are eleven months apart, and they look like twins almost. Last Sunday, we went to Angel Island together. While mom and Mark did their kissy-kissy private thing, the three of us went for a hike and rode bicycles and stuff. The girls are way cool, and I feel like we've known each other all our lives! It's different from anything I've ever felt before in my whole life! Rhea's bicycle chain--she is so cute--kept coming off her bike, and I had to keep stopping to fix it for her. My hands got all black, and she came up to me and kissed me on the cheek and told me that she was going to like having a big brother. And then she hugged me real big like. It felt good to be wanted by someone, for real I mean.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you have a new friend there. I'm glad, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Not so fast, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Huh?"}, {"instruction": "It ain't as pretty as you seem to think it is. I mean, how do I stop this feeling? I don't know how to describe it actually, but it is real uncomfortable for me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "When Rhea hugged me and kissed me, I realized that I hadn't been touched by anyone in any way for a long time. Weeks maybe, I'm not sure. I recoiled when she touched me. Then later when we were back at the house, I realized that here was the big family. And my fantasy thing was real suddenly, but I felt like I was invisible in the room. No, not invisible. Alone. I felt like I was alone and the room was full of people. Isn't that sort of weird?", "input": "", "output": "Not really. If you came in here and painted a perfect picture of your life and family for me, I would have been surprised.  After all, so much has happened in your life and at such a rapid-fire pace, it's overwhelming. What you just described to me could be your way of detaching--allowing your mind and heart time to absorb it all and analyze it. You may experience some unusual feelings and emotions for some time until you have had enough time to process everything and heal. But don't worry, usually these things are temporary and you seem to have a way of bouncing back."}, {"instruction": "That's true--I'm a cat and I always land on my feet!", "input": "", "output": "There you go! Good work, Alex. So, this session went fast. Same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "You bet! Party on, Dude! No, on second thought, don't party on--it hurts!", "input": "", "output": "See you next week, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Nah. Actually, I kind of like it. It keeps my head focused on the present, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I suppose that it would. Are you having trouble with staying focused on things lately?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, sometimes I do. There's a lot going on in my mind right now, and I seem to find it harder to keep focused on any one thing.", "input": "", "output": "Well, there's certainly a lot going on in your life. But I'm glad that you've figured out one way to remain focused and in the moment. And it's a healthy way to do it, I might add."}, {"instruction": "I got a new bike last weekend. Actually, Ralph got it for me. It's a Schwinn Mesa GSX. It has the rock-shocks on it and the new style braking system--it's real cool. Haven't been able to stay away from it for too long. I was thinking about riding it down to Belmont to see Roly, but I think that he might be home before I build myself up to such a distance, you know? But I did get down there to see him, a couple of times actually. I didn't even recognize him, they have him so drugged up.", "input": "", "output": "How did it make you feel to see him that way?"}, {"instruction": "Well, at first I was shocked, because he really looked different to me. He lost a lot of weight. I know he didn't lose it all overnight or anything, but he really is skinny right now. And his skin is whiter than white. His hair was all messed up like it hadn't been combed in days. But it was his eyes that really scared me.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I was expecting his eyes to be bloodshot or something like that. But here he was with this totally blank expression in them, like he wasn't really in there, you know? I guess they plan to keep him there for a while. I'm sure his father is behind all this.", "input": "", "output": "What does his father have to do with it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, even though Roly is over eighteen, his dad still calls the shots. Roly doesn't even have a job, so his dad is paying for that place and I'm certain that it isn't cheap. But since his dad pays for it, he gets to decide when Roly gets out. And it's not that his dad really cares about Roly or anything; it's just a matter of his dad's convenience.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I'm sure there's more to the situation than what you see. Roly's condition tells me that. Plus, Roly's doctors are the ones who make the decisions about treatment, not his father."}, {"instruction": "Never mind. You don't understand his father, but that's not all that important. Roly's dad is this rich guy who uses his money to manipulate people, and I'll bet they have Roly all drugged up because his father wants it that way. It keeps Roly out of his hair for a while. He did it to him before, when he was in the hospital the last time. But this isn't what I wanted to talk to you about anyway. I have other things I want to talk to you about. The first part of my plan is coming together. I just got my admission package to the Culinary Academy, but it looks like I won't be able to start there until next year because of the GED thing and my age.", "input": "", "output": "I'll bet it feels good to get things rolling."}, {"instruction": "It's good, I guess. Kind of pissed me off that I may have to wait a while before things start to happen though. People my age have absolutely no rights at all. That pisses me off too, you know?  I'm not a stupid person, but most people my age are, so go figure. Most people my age are sitting in front of a TV or a computer all day, and I mean all the time! That's no way to learn anything. I learned things the old fashioned way--by experiencing them and by reading books. My grandmother wouldn't even let me see a television, let alone turn one on. We didn't have TV in the living room like most people do, and I think that they did me a favor by being like that. Mom told me that they did the same thing with her, too. But she doesn't even use her brain, you know? And she's not really a stupid person, she just does stupid things. Oh, by the way, I'm not going back there.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not going to live in that house.", "input": "", "output": "What happened? Last week it seemed like you were gearing yourself up to move back in."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what it is, but something is going on there that I haven't been able to figure out. Mark's birthday is coming up, and mom called to ask me to go with her to the Embarcadero Center to get him a present. When I got to the house, I could hear Mark and my mom fighting with each other, but I didn't hear what it was about. So when I went inside, they acted like nothing was wrong. I was looking at my mom and she was playing innocent. So I just came out and asked Mark what he thought he was doing--fighting with my mom like that, yelling the way he was. Then he and I went outside and I was ready to kick his ass, you know? He told me that mom was having a hard time adjusting to all the changes in her life--Mark and the girls moved in and Aunt Sofie lying in the hospital. I started to think of Aunt Sofie in the hospital--it reminded me of my grandmother and what she went through. I guess Aunt Sofie is sort of going through the same thing. I bet it reminds my mom of the same thing, you know? So this all made sense then. Although the idea of my mom being hard to live with wasn't a surprise to me!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear about your aunt, Alex. But what was it that bothers you about going back home?"}, {"instruction": "Think about this for a minute. What happened to Mark's wife? Why don't Racyl and Rhea know what happened to their mom? My mom and I don't get along and all. But if I had a dad and he took me away somewhere, I think that she would look for me or something. So I asked Mark that, too. I asked him where she was, and he didn't have a good answer.", "input": "", "output": "What did he tell you?"}, {"instruction": "He told me that they got a divorce and that he got custody of the girls. Come on! I wasn't born under the turnip truck, you know? They were married and living as a family just a few months ago. I don't believe that the bureaucracy is any different in Canada than it is here. But the weird part is that neither Racyl nor Rhea seem to care much about her. I asked them and they weren't even bothered by it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But that's not the only reason I am not going back there. When my mom and I were shopping, she needed to go into the bathroom just about every ten minutes. I asked her what was wrong, and she said that she must have eaten something bad or something. But I think she was lying to me.", "input": "", "output": "Why do think she would lie to you about that?"}, {"instruction": "Do you remember what she looked like? I mean what her appearance was like? Only weeks ago, she had some color in her cheeks and a little fat on her body. And now she has lost weight and looks like hell. At first, I thought she wasn't wearing any makeup, but then I really looked at her--she was wearing makeup but it made her look just that: made up. At least before, she looked like she was ready for a stage performance. Now she looks made up and phony. You know, I just realized how superficial so many things are. People, events, media--it's all so superficial and concocted, you know? But you know what I think it is with my mom?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I think she is dying.", "input": "", "output": "Because of the weight loss and her repeated visits to the bathroom?"}, {"instruction": "Well, those things all by themselves wouldn't make me think that. But all of a sudden she is being sweeter than sweet to me and trying to get us all together as a family--it's really bizarre. I asked her and she said there is nothing wrong. But I know that something is up with her, something serious, maybe even something bad.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Well, don't jump to any conclusions just yet, Alex.  There might be a perfectly reasonable explanation to all of this."}, {"instruction": "I don't even know how I feel about it, you know? If she dies then I will be left pretty much alone. But I'll still have Ralph, and he's trying hard to make things work out better for us. How could I move back in with her and then have her die on me? I just don't...ah, I really haven't thought about how I feel about all this.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Alex, I think that it would be better if you sat down with your mom and told her your concerns--not about her dying, but about the things that make you feel uncomfortable or that you think are odd. As I said, maybe there's a logical explanation for all this. Tell your mom that you're worried about her. Say that you would like to know what's going. I'll bet if you try to keep yourself from being confrontational, she'll tell you what you want know."}, {"instruction": "I don't know that I want to know, you know? That sounded funny. But I may be better off not knowing. I'll think about it though. Guess what else Ralph did? He went out and bought a bunch of stuff and set up one of the extra bedrooms as an art studio. That was a big surprise.", "input": "", "output": "Is Ralph an artist?"}, {"instruction": "No, not at all. He did it for me. I showed him some of the drawings I did, and he went wild over one of them--he actually took it and had it framed. Since he did that, I've been making these mosaic style drawings--they sort of look like stained-glass windows. And playing around with the colors has been a lot of fun. I realized this week that keeping myself busy is going to save my sanity, you know?", "input": "", "output": "That was certainly a nice thing for Ralph to do. And a new bicycle, too."}, {"instruction": "Well, I think he's just trying to kiss my ass and keep me there longer, you know? But it did feel good to come home and find my drawing matted and framed like that.  It was the Porsche that I showed you, remember?  The one that was made up entirely of dots?", "input": "", "output": "I remember."}, {"instruction": "Well, Ralph is being very good to me, and it feels good. I figure that I'm worth it, you know? It's not like I asked for these things, and plus I work my butt off cooking dinner for him just about every night. This is his way of showing me that he appreciates it. And he really is trying to make things work with us. Really.", "input": "", "output": "Who are you trying to convince?"}, {"instruction": "What the hell does that mean?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you don't seem to be very convinced about what you're telling me yourself. Please, correct me if I'm wrong."}, {"instruction": "Well, I can't really place it into words. Shit.  Okay, there is something else going on there, too. Or maybe it's just me, I don't know. He brought over this man--this seventy-six year old man who used to be an art instructor. This guy was looking at my work and telling me that I have a promising talent, and he was offering to teach me--just like I was telling you I wanted to do.", "input": "", "output": "What's wrong with that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when Ralph left the two of us alone for a while, this guy started to act all weird--like he was drooling over me and being all perverted and stuff. I guess I thought that he was going to grab my crotch or try to do something to me--not that he would or even could get away with that kind of shit--but it made me feel like I was being prostituted out for some reason. It reminded me of Tony. And it reminded me of Benny, too.", "input": "", "output": "Who is Tony?"}, {"instruction": "Tony is Marney's little brother. He was my best friend in the whole world up until I got involved with Benny. He disappeared. He was into the trick scene and then he vanished.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think he's dead?"}, {"instruction": "No, he's not.  That I know for sure. Every once in a while I get a cryptic message on my voice mail from him. So I know he's alive. I just don't know where he is and neither does his family. That's why Marney came back--someone contacted them in France and told them that they saw him recently here in the Bay Area. So she came back to look for him.", "input": "", "output": "But why did this remind you of Benny?"}, {"instruction": "Benny was the one who got Tony into tricking in the first place, just like he got me into it. Only Tony kept getting bad tricks--they would hurt him in some way. This one trick became obsessed with him, and I think that's where he is now--with that trick. And there were probably drugs and stuff too, but I'm not certain of that. That trick was a real old dude from what Tony had told me about him. So that's why this old fart reminds me of that. But I kept control of the situation with that old art teacher guy--I wasn't going to let him get away with anything.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that Ralph intended..."}, {"instruction": "Oh no! No way! No, Ralph wouldn't do anything like that. It was probably just me and my pointy little head working a number on my mind, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, I see. Well, Alex, our time is up for today. If you get these intuitions about people that Ralph is trying to..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know--call you.", "input": "", "output": "That's right.  Okay, Alex, I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess so.", "input": "", "output": "Okay then, take care. And Alex? Keep up the good work."}, {"instruction": "I'm a little saddle sore from riding the bike so much.", "input": "", "output": "I noticed that you don't have a helmet with you. I remembered that last week as well. Do you use a helmet?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want to hear it, man. And I've already heard it from Ralph, and my mom, and Aunt Sofie. I don't like wearing it; it's too uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "I understand how you feel. I felt the same way when I first wore one. I felt like it looked funny, too."}, {"instruction": "Well then, you understand where I'm coming from. So don't give me any shit about it, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Okay, but..."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to hear it!", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So tell me what's going on? How you are feeling and...Alex? What's that smell? Have you started smoking again?"}, {"instruction": "No, I haven't. Well, not really, but...Roly likes to smoke dope. And lately I've been feeling pretty wound up, you know? Real tight--like a spring. So anyway, I smoked some with him the other day, and this seed or something popped and landed on one of my dreads and burned it and...well, I can't seem to get rid of the smell. That's what you smell--my hair.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Alex, I don't want to give a you a lecture on the use of illegal drugs, but..."}, {"instruction": "Then don't. I don't want to hear any lectures about it, okay? Jeez! What's with you anyway? You think you're my father or something? First, the helmet and now the pot--what are you going to come down on me for next?", "input": "", "output": "It's not my intention to \"come down\" on you, Alex.  But I'm going to tell you when I think you are taking actions which aren't in your best interest.  And riding without a helmet is stupid, and smoking pot really isn't such a good idea."}, {"instruction": "Okay, but I'm no dummy. I know what I can handle and what my limits are, so let it go already.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Let's talk about your feelings.  You said you've been feeling all wound up. What's going on there?"}, {"instruction": "You don't give up, do you? Okay, okay, I'll tell you what's been going on. First, this week I got a call from guess who?", "input": "", "output": "Benny?"}, {"instruction": "Bingo! And he wants me to forgive him and help him. I mean, hello? I'm ready to kill, and he wants me to help him? Ha! I laughed at him. He was so sincere and sweet and apologetic. But you should have heard him when I laughed--he just went off. Even Ralph could hear it from all the way across the room. I asked him, \"What? They let you guys use the phones? I was hoping your fingers would be broken by now.\" But when he was yelling at me, he told me that he knew what I did to his precious little car and that he would get me for it. And he said that he'd get me for turning him in, too. When I tried to say something, he yelled over me and then the line was cut-off. I bet they pulled the plug on him when he started yelling. Or maybe somehow he snuck a phone call when he was in some office or something, I don't know. So Dora spilled the beans on me and Roly.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And how did it make you feel to hear Benny's voice again? It's been a while..."}, {"instruction": "At first, I felt like a deer in the headlights--paralyzed. But then, when I realized why he was calling me, something changed and I had to just laugh--it was so ridiculous, you know? It was like he had no clue what's going on with me. And he thought I turned him in--good old Dora didn't spill all of it. I'm a little pissed at her right now. But after the call, I went straight to my bathroom and hurled my guts out. Poor Ralph got the distinct pleasure of cleaning up after me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. You mentioned Roly. When was he released from the hospital?"}, {"instruction": "Well, ah...um...he was kind of...sort of not released. But he's out.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll tell you. But you've got to promise me that you won't try to interfere or anything.  I think I can trust you and all, and I don't want to think that after all this time I won't be able to trust you. So you have to promise.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure what I would promising. Tell me what happened, Alex, and we'll go from there."}, {"instruction": "Well, I went to visit him a few more times, and he was still android-boy--no Roly behind those eyes. He was still heavily drugged. But when I'd visit him, he'd sort of come on and be there with me for a minute or two. Then last week--Friday I think--I went down there and they had moved him from the locked unit to the open unit. We even got to take a walk. So we're walking along and no one's speaking, then all of a sudden Roly just stops and grabs my shoulders and tells me that he has got to get out of there. He said that he was hiding his drugs, and when the nurse wasn't looking he dumped them down the toilet. So there he was--his old self again. And I was looking at him, hearing what he was saying. He told me that he thought that they were going to give him electroshock treatment. And I was like, \"No way, dude.\" And so we just kept on walking.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I know your intentions were honorable--you were trying to help your friend. But Roly was prescribed those medications for a reason. If he just stops taking them, there could be very serious consequences. Where is he staying?"}, {"instruction": "Look, I can see you and I aren't going to agree on this either. I don't think I should tell you anymore about Roly. So, let's change the subject. How about those Giants?", "input": "", "output": "This is very serious, Alex. I'm worried that Roly's health might be in danger. Alex, I think you should talk Roly into seeking some help."}, {"instruction": "You look like you saw a ghost or something. What's the matter with you today anyway? Haven't I asked you that already?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, all I know is what you told me about Roly--he's very depressed, he's having problems coping, and there's a possibility that he could hurt himself.  This is serious and you know it.  You are getting help, and I believe that you know that Roly should too."}, {"instruction": "Okay, so tell me then, how would I go about getting him to go back there? It's not like I can go get him and then take him there without him knowing what I was up to, you know? I didn't force him to leave that place. Plus right now, I don't even know where he's staying. What if I tell him what you told me and then let him decide what he wants to do? How does that sound?", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like the best I'm going to be able to do.  So I think that would be good."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. A couple of other things happened, and I want to tell you about them. I don't want to get into the dream shit...or maybe I should be calling them nightmares?", "input": "", "output": "Are you still having nightmares?"}, {"instruction": "Almost nightly. I'm just about afraid to go to sleep, but I do anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Do you remember your nightmares?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing. Everything. I don't know exactly. I dream about Benny practically every night, and now Dora's visiting me in my sleep. But that thing with the old fart--the art teacher--well, he was coming up there too, until I talked to Ralph about it.", "input": "", "output": "What did Ralph have to say about it?"}, {"instruction": "I told him what my suspicions were, and he said I was right on the money.", "input": "", "output": "You mean he was really trying to prostitute you?"}, {"instruction": "No! No way! Gosh, you have a dirty mind. That's not what I meant. The guy was acting weird and all, but Ralph told me he does that to anything that moves. All I needed to do with him was to lay down the law, and he would have respected that. But I told Ralph that I don't want to learn from that guy right now, maybe later on.", "input": "", "output": "It was a good thing to talk to Ralph about it and let him know how you were feeling."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I felt better telling him all that. It seems as though Ralph really does respect my wishes a lot more than I give him credit for. Oh, and I decided to take your advice and talk to mom about what was going on with her.  It totally backfired on me.", "input": "", "output": "Why? What happened?"}, {"instruction": "When I started to ask her about it, she kept changing the subject. But I pressed her some more. Well, she blew up in my face and got all pissed off at me, calling me names and shit. I had to cut and run, you know? I even asked Mark about it before I tried to talk to her, and he just told me to ask her. He was weird about it though.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "When I asked him, he was all stuttering and saying stuff like, \"It's not my place to talk about this with you. There's nothing to worry about\"--bull like that. He knows what is going on, but he won't give. But I did something else where he's concerned.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I went over to the house when I knew everyone would be gone, and I got into his stuff. Found a photo of his \"ex-wife.\" She is my mom's clone, it's real scary. And her name is Lori--kind of like the Twilight Zone, you know? I even found some letters she wrote him, and I don't think they are divorced at all.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "In one of the letters she said something like she can't even come to California to see him and the girls. It seemed to me that she might be in jail or something. The way it was said was as though she were being held somewhere against her will and that Mark held the key to her release or something. But I'm going to get to the bottom of this. She didn't come right out and say these things, you know? It's just the tone of the letters and the way she wrote the words. The more my mom acts weird and the more Mark tries to hide from my questions, the more I want to know the truth. And it's just like her to keep secrets from me, you know? It really pisses me off. Lately, I can't stop thinking about that, or about Benny's threats--as if he was in a position to do anything to me, that fool! Or I just can't seem to turn it off, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Turn it off?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, like my head won't stop spinning around with all these thoughts going on.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, we are almost out of time. I would like to show you a trick that sometimes helps to keep the mind from wandering and helps keep the focus on the here and now.  Now, humor me, okay? First, stomp both you feet on the floor. Harder. Good. Tell me what you feel."}, {"instruction": "Duh, the floor.", "input": "", "output": "You feel your feet hitting the floor, right? Good. Now, slap your knees with your hands and then rub them like this. Yes, that's right. What do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "My hands are stinging and my knees hurt.", "input": "", "output": "This would be the thing to do when you find yourself drifting--something physical.  Even a little thing like this can sometimes force you into the moment and out of your head. And I'll bet you can figure out other ways to achieve this goal."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll try that. You know, I'm pretty hard on you sometimes and I don't mean to be. I know you are helping me and I do appreciate it, see?", "input": "", "output": "I understand perfectly, Alex. Well, this is it. Same time next week then?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, dude, thanks a lot! See you!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Well, Doctor, you won.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. What did I win?"}, {"instruction": "The damned helmet--I got a helmet.", "input": "", "output": "What made you decide to get one?"}, {"instruction": "Ralph had already bought it along with the bike, and after those two bicycle riders bit it over the last week, I decided to put the stupid thing on.", "input": "", "output": "You'll get accustomed to it, Alex. I did. It can make all the difference in the world if you ever have an accident and hit your head. You made a good decision. How are you feeling this week?"}, {"instruction": "Still muddled, I guess. I don't know. I think I'm cursed, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What would make you say that?"}, {"instruction": "My head keeps on running around with stuff. And then this week, I started waking up in the middle of the night with a song stuck in my head, and I can't make it stop. Oh yeah, by the way, here's another picture I did. It's just a simple sketch, but Ralph liked it. He got me going on it when he came home last Sunday morning with concert tickets in his hands. So I drew a picture of her, my favorite, Stevie Nicks.", "input": "", "output": "You got tickets to see Fleetwood Mac? I know a lot of people want to go see them."}, {"instruction": "I've never seen them before, so Ralph bought three tickets: one for himself, one for me, and the other one is sort of an extra. But if Marney is still here when they come, then she'll probably go with us. I really like them; they do real rock and roll, not at all like anything that's considered 'cool' today. People are so strange; they listen to anything, even if it's only for the noise. Quality's out, noise is in.", "input": "", "output": "I know what you mean, but I'm the older generation and I'm not supposed to have an opinion on such things. Tell me more about these running thoughts you are having."}, {"instruction": "Well, I already told you about the phone call from Benny. Well, he called again and I've been having these dreams again--or nightmares, take your pick, it makes no difference. He called the other day and just spoke real quiet and monotone.  He told me he was going to get me. I told him to come on down! Of course, he's not going to be going anywhere for a long time, except maybe in Bruno's cell as his butt-buddy!  I'll bet he's the bell-of-the-ball in there!  But I did manage to tell him that it was Dora who turned him in--she was the one who had the videotape that the police used against him. You could hear a pin drop after I told him--he was dead silent. It made him think about it, I bet. If he puts all the pieces together, he'll figure out it wasn't me. I just thought of Benny being Bruno's butt-buddy and the bell-of-the-ball--there's a real tongue twister; say that ten times! Then after I got off the phone, I went straight for the porcelain god and heaved my guts up again. It was then that I realized that I was cursed.", "input": "", "output": "You said that before. What makes you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Hello? It doesn't take much to figure it out, really. You see my curse is making the people I care about disappear from my life. First, it was my dad. Then, my grandmother. Now, it's Benny and Roly. Hell, even Sael hasn't called me in weeks! Mom and I aren't talking at all again--no surprise there. Oh, and I forgot to mention Tony--he was the third one to disappear.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, the only thing in common between all these people is that you cared about each of them. You didn't cause any of them to leave. Your grandparents were ill and then died. There wasn't anything you could have done to make that turn out differently. According to what you told me about Tony, he went away on his own--it didn't sound like it had anything to do with you. And with Benny..."}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay. Stop, already. If it weren't for me, Tony would have never met Benny. And if they'd never met, Tony wouldn't be in the situation he is in...ah...now, I guess. And Roly--well, he went crazy, and that was because of what came down between all of us.", "input": "", "output": "Right. And the thing to keep in mind is that both Benny and Roly were in an explosive situation to begin with, and you're not to blame."}, {"instruction": "Why do I feel so lonely all the time then? Why do I feel like I'm alone in a crowded room? No one wants to come near me because of the curse. If they come near me, then they will either die or be thrust away from here, from me. My mom is on her way out now. And that means that Mark, Racyl, and Rhea won't be far behind.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you're describing the normal happenstance of life. People come and go. People die. These are things that would happen in your life regardless of what you do. This is what happens to everyone at one time or another. Now about your mother, I had an idea that came to me and I'd like to bounce it off you, would that be okay? Good. Alex, has it occurred to you that she may be pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "Oh great! Not you too! Ralph said the same damned thing--she's pregnant. That idea thoroughly disgusts me. Shit! She's too old to get pregnant! She couldn't do that to me, could she? No. No way. Uh, um...do you really think that she could be?", "input": "", "output": "Think about the things you have told me--Mark's reaction when you approached him; your mother's frequent trips to the bathroom..."}, {"instruction": "Oh yuck! This is so sick, you know? I mean, she's too damned old to get pregnant, isn't she? Oh, I don't know. I don't want to think about it. I mean yuck!", "input": "", "output": "I just thought I'd bring it up as a possibility."}, {"instruction": "I told you, I don't want to think about it!", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I would like to ask you again about pot smoking and Roly. These were things that disturbed me a lot last time. Do you want to talk about it?"}, {"instruction": "Here we go! I knew you were going to bring that up again. I just knew it! Well, first of all, I still don't know where Roly is. And as far as pot is concerned, I wouldn't even know where to get it. I just smoked it a few times with him. Anyway, no big deal. Shit, the only thing it did was to make me paranoid, you know? So no, I'm not going to go out and become a pot-head, if that's what you are worried about. As for Roly, I think that he went back to a hospital somewhere. I went down to that place in Belmont, and he wasn't there. But they told me that even if he was there, I wouldn't be allowed to see him anyway after what happened. Shit! And he hadn't had a single visitor when he was there. Not even his own father came to see him. Only me. And now, I don't even know where he is. You know, I was just thinking about Tony. I wonder if Benny did it to him like he did me and Roly. I should ask him, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Do you know where he is?"}, {"instruction": "Well, ah...yes, I do. But Marney can't see him like this--the way he is now.", "input": "", "output": "Have you at least told her you know where he is?"}, {"instruction": "Well, no. It all happened so fast, you know? I was sitting there when the phone rang. I didn't recognize the number on the caller ID box, but I picked up anyway and it was Tony. He has been here in the city all along. And this old dude--way older than you--is keeping him.", "input": "", "output": "Why can't Marney see Tony?  What's wrong with him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I could only stay for a minute or two, because the old man was going to be back any minute. But I did find him and talked to him, and he's totally fucked-up. The guy who is keeping him is doing just that: keeping him. On a leash, in a room, and on crank--big time T-R-O-U-B-L-E! The old guy is a fister and has been taking care of Tony. But, you know, it's not my problem. I just have to figure out what to tell Marney, because she's going to catch-on that I know something. Tony said that he's where he wants to be, but I know that he's lying about it.", "input": "", "output": "Why would he lie to you?"}, {"instruction": "Because the old dude will kill him if he gets away. I think that he's a prisoner or something, in a way. And I don't think that Marney will just sit by and allow it to happen, you know? Even if Tony says this is what he wants, she won't have any of it. But it's all too complicated for me. And I have my own crap to deal with right now, so I won't be getting too involved in this one. He's on his own, as far as I'm concerned.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. But it's important to tell Marney the truth about what you know, Alex. Remember how you felt when you found out that people have lied or simply kept the truth from you."}, {"instruction": "I know. But it's hard, because I know that as soon as I tell her, she's going to want me to help her get him out of there. And I don't think I can do that right now. It's too much. It's way too much! I think my head is going to explode or something.", "input": "", "output": "I understand how overwhelming it is for you, Alex. You have a lot of problems that you need to deal with right now.  Have you been able to get some control over your run-away thoughts? Have you tried the knee slapping or foot stomping techniques we talked about last week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I did. But I'll do you one better; I found that if I sit at the desk in my art room and draw, my mind clears itself. It's amazing what I'm doing with color right now. I'll bring some of those in soon. Ralph is having some of them photographed and made into little cards. He thinks that I have a special style--unlike anything he's ever seen before. And I'm beginning to think that he's right. A few people who've seen these drawings go 'ooh' and 'ah' over them, and I really like what I've created, too. It's the first time that I've been real proud of my work, you know?", "input": "", "output": "It's a good productive way of getting your feelings out, and I would love to see your drawings. But I'm worried that you might use your art sorely as a means of escaping..."}, {"instruction": "Don't let it bug you--I'm not that bad off...yet. Oh yeah, another interesting thing happened this week. I was at mom's house one day looking through Mark's stuff again, and the phone rang. I automatically picked it up. This woman asked for Mark, and I told her he was at work. And then I asked who she was. She told me Lori. So I asked her where she was and why won't she come over? Well, she told me that she was on her way to San Francisco right now, and that she can't wait to be reunited with her family. I'm certain that Mark and this woman aren't divorced--I'd bet my last nickel on it. But she did sound kind of weird, though.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "Like she was wired up. Or like she was on the run or something. I don't know how to describe it really, except that she was in a rush to get off the phone. And she was speaking very quietly like she didn't want someone else to hear her talking. It should be fun to see what happens when she gets here.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell anyone that she called?"}, {"instruction": "No. Why? You think I should? I thought it would be a nice surprise for them--for all of them. Don't you?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I don't know what to make of it, to be honest with you. It may be a good idea to at least let Mark know that you spoke with her."}, {"instruction": "I figured you'd say something like that. Aren't we out of time yet?", "input": "", "output": "Almost. Alex, I wanted to ask you about the community work in Delores Park that you've been doing this summer. That should be ending soon, right?"}, {"instruction": "This week, and then I go back to hell--that fucking school in San Mateo.", "input": "", "output": "Which school?"}, {"instruction": "Serra High School. The school for boys. I don't fit in there, and I don't really want to go back. I'd much rather continue to work in the park, you know? Since Cal and I made up, things've been great. And I've really begun to like the work, if you can believe that.", "input": "", "output": "I can believe it. Physical work is very rewarding in many ways. Well, Alex, we've covered a lot of ground today. See you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. But we'll have to do it later in the day, since I'll be in purgatory during the day.", "input": "", "output": "I have an opening at five o'clock next Wednesday, September tenth. Will that work for you?"}, {"instruction": "Cool, that works. See you then, dude.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Here, let me take off my beanie. There, see? It's still there, only a lot less of it. I had to cut some off to get that burned part out.", "input": "", "output": "It looks nice."}, {"instruction": "Well thanks. It really makes a difference when I'm wearing my helmet. Ralph says I should go all the way and cut it short, but I think to my shoulders is short enough, you know?", "input": "", "output": "It looks nice this way, Alex. So tell me what's been going on with you this week? Oh, and how is school?"}, {"instruction": "Do we have to talk about school? It's there, that's about all I can say. The only good thing is that I was able to get into a couple of art classes including sculpting. I like papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and perspective drawing. They are offering these little mini courses within a class. So that should be cool. The other classes I have are Economics, the typical Algebra and History, and the other shit that we have to take. Oh, and I got into an advanced English class. But everything is so controlled these days, you know? Even the media--all controlled.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, do you ever pay attention to ads? I mean really pay attention? They are not only pretty stupid, but they are subliminal. Little messages come out of them: \"consume, consume.\" It's all a joke. It's all so superficial, just like those pretty-boys down there at school--superficial. Roly is like that too, in a way. He spends money like it's nothing. And all he wants to do is buy things: clothes, watches, CD's--and he has a lot of them, too. But there's so much more to life than buying things. So many things are available that you don't have to buy, but most people don't see it that way. A walk on the beach, for example, that's free. Petting a dog--free, too. So I see that a lot of stuff just isn't necessary. And so many people go out of their way to make things hard, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Did you ever call a business and got someone who put you on hold or transferred you around and around? I just want to scream when they do that. People are totally rude to each other. The other day, I saw this old lady, I mean she was really old or something. She was driving along the freeway, and this dude cut her off. So she jutted her car around and in front of him and then slammed on her brakes while giving him the finger. It was an old lady, for Christ sakes. What an example for the younger generations, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And controlled. Our society is totally controlled by these fucked-up old white dudes who don't even have a clue how real people live. Now they have cameras at stoplights, and if you run a red it takes your picture and then you get a ticket in the mail. Happened to me while I was driving mom's car. She was pissed because the ticket got mailed to her. So now I try to stop at the lights more than before. Before I used to race to get through the intersection. Soon, I'll bet, they'll put up scanner devices on the freeways--if you go too fast, you'll get a speeding ticket. And they won't need as many cops and stuff, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you seem very wound up today. How are you feeling right now?"}, {"instruction": "That's a hard question, Doctor. How am I feeling? Well, I'll tell you. Ralph was getting irritated with my irritation last week--I've been real irritated lately, you know? So he goes out and buys...see? There we go again--brash consumerism. He buys a huge punching bag and installs it in the garage. When he took me down there to see it, I had no idea what he wanted me to do with it. So he gives me the gloves and then hands me a marking pen.", "input": "", "output": "What was the marking pen for?"}, {"instruction": "That's what I wanted to know. He told me to write anything on the bag that would help me get my aggressions out and then wail away on it.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "You better believe I did! Man! It was exhilarating, too. I was a little hesitant at first, but then he showed me how to punch it and stuff. And when I did, I let out a yell and then kept punching and yelling. Guess what I wrote on it?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I wrote two things: \"Die Benny\" and \"Fuck you Dad.\" I guess you can say that I'm not as wound up as I was.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good way to release your aggressions, Alex. Better than some past actions you've taken. How do your arms feel?"}, {"instruction": "Right now, they feel pumped. But the first day or two, they felt like rubber.", "input": "", "output": "I'll bet. If this is helping you, then I would encourage you to keep it up."}, {"instruction": "You know I will. I haven't missed a day hitting that thing. Marney watched me do it, and then she did it, too. It was so cool to see her do that.", "input": "", "output": "Have you told her about her brother yet?"}, {"instruction": "Yes I did. It was hard to do it. But I thought about what you said last week. You know, I reminded myself how I felt when I discovered that someone--that bitch--kept secrets from me. I asked her again, you know? Only this time, I came right out and said it: \"Mom, are you pregnant?\" Well, she still lied about it and then got mad at me for asking. I don't know why she thinks she has to hide it from me. But she got what she deserves for it, that's for sure.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean? What happened to her?"}, {"instruction": "Well, her drama and antics put a lot of pressure on her. For every lie she made, she had to make up another one. And then before she knew it, it was all too much to deal with, and she totally stressed out and ended up in the hospital for a few days. Now she has to lie in bed all day long or she will lose the baby, at least that's what Rhea told me. Got what she earned, you know? The bitch.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds pretty serious, Alex. Did your mom finally tell you the truth?"}, {"instruction": "Mark did. Then when she realized I knew, she told me to get out.", "input": "", "output": "She threw you out?"}, {"instruction": "I'm the cause for her problems, you know? She always needs someone to blame, and who's better to blame than me? I'm the bad seed, the rotten son--you name it and she's called me it. You know what I told her? I told her that the only reason she's pissed at me is because this pregnancy reminds her of when she was pregnant with me and now everyone's going pay.", "input": "", "output": "You act like you don't seem to care either way about her pregnancy. How do you really feel about it, Alex? Are you relieved to know that she's not dying or very ill?"}, {"instruction": "I hope that baby gives her morning sickness all the way up to the end, you know? She deserves it. I think it is pretty sick--someone her age having a baby. Especially since there will be such a big age difference between me and it, you know? Sick, sick, sick! That's how I feel about it. As far as what I thought before, this is better because now she gets to suffer!", "input": "", "output": "I see. Alex, have you thought about writing your mother's name on that punching bag?"}, {"instruction": "You're a real funny guy, you know that? But it's a good idea. Maybe I'll do just that. Maybe I'll write her name all over it. Hmm, hadn't thought about it before now, but that really is a good idea. Thanks, Doctor. I'm going to go do that right now. Bye!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, we still have plenty of time. I would like to talk a bit more about Marney. What happened after you told her about Tony?"}, {"instruction": "I told you already. She pummeled that punching bag, remember?", "input": "", "output": "And what happened after that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she wanted to go right over there and get him--just like I told you she would. But I kept her from doing that right away. We made a plan, and I got Roly in on it, too.", "input": "", "output": "You found Roly?"}, {"instruction": "He found me, actually. He's staying in this sleazy place over in the Tenderloin, and he's trying to stay clean. Operative word: trying. He goes back and forth, up and down. He's a human yo-yo! Crazier than the masses, he is. But he's harmless, really. So anyway, I agreed to try to get Tony out of that place. But I told Marney that I didn't want her there when we do it, because I don't want her to see the stuff that's in that house. It would make her sick to know what kind of sex goes on there. And the toys in there are enough to make deep-throat blush! But Roly and me are going to go over there this weekend, when the old fart is out of the house, and get Tony. Tony knows something is coming down, but he isn't sure what. And I want to keep him kind of in the dark about it until the very last minute, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Alex, this could be a very dangerous thing for you to do. What if that man comes home and tries to stop you? What if Tony doesn't want to be saved? Have you thought everything through?"}, {"instruction": "Look at me, Doctor. I'm bigger than most adults, and I've seen that old fucker. He's big, but he's not that big. I know I can take him. Roly and I together surely can overpower him, if we need to.", "input": "", "output": "This is what I'm talking about, Alex. If it comes to blows..."}, {"instruction": "Not a problem. He won't give us any trouble. And don't try to talk me out of it, because Tony and Marney are my friends, probably my only true friends besides Ralph and maybe you. And it's the least I can do for them. So don't give me any shit about it, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I can certainly understand wanting to help your friends, but in case something goes wrong..."}, {"instruction": "I've thought of that already, Doc. I'm going to call Marney as soon as we get up to Castro street--she'll give us thirty minutes to get in and out. So we already covered that part of it. The next part is to get Tony to a doctor. He's in real bad shape. He told me that he is HIV positive, but he isn't showing any symptoms yet. And the drugs aren't helping any--his addiction to them is what's been keeping him there. I just have to keep Tony and Roly from spending too much time together.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you're taking on a lot of responsibility here. And you don't really have to..."}, {"instruction": "No shit, remember? I told you to not give me any shit about it!", "input": "", "output": "I'm concerned that by taking on all of these worries and responsibilities...please keep in mind that I'm a phone call away, if you need me."}, {"instruction": "I guess you're telling me that we are out of time?", "input": "", "output": "I'm telling you that if you feel things get out of control or over your head, to call me.  And yes, we are out of time for today. Same time next week then? Oh and Alex, I'm glad to hear about the art classes. And Ralph's punching bag idea--it's good."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm glad he got it. Oh well, got to catch that bus, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Where's your bike today?"}, {"instruction": "I took it over for its first tune-up. They told us to bring it in after a month or so for some adjustments and stuff. I'll get it back tomorrow.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, then. Take care, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doctor Balis. How are you doing?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. What..."}, {"instruction": "The black eye? I knew you'd ask me about it. Got into a fight at school.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, this jerk, Tommy Hillstaad--big stupid jock--was teasing this kid, calling him 'little faggot' and shit like that, you know? And I was just about up to the limit already: my mom is being a bitch; and I wasn't able to get Tony--Marney is real upset about that, too, by the way. So, this stupid-ass jock was taunting this poor kid who was too afraid to fight back. I mean, he is only in the ninth grade and that jerk was being a big-ass bully. So I punched him out. Later, he got me back. And then we both ended up in the dean's office. And now I'm like...uh, I guess you can say I'm suspended now pending expulsion.", "input": "", "output": "Oh Alex, that isn't good."}, {"instruction": "You're telling me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And what about your outfit? I wasn't actually looking at your shiner when you first walked in. Velvet, isn't it? I can't decide if you are dressed for a funeral or a party."}, {"instruction": "You're too funny. It does look like velvet, huh? Everyone wants to feel it. It's made of leather, brushed leather. Nala designed it.", "input": "", "output": "Nala?"}, {"instruction": "Uh hum. The one and only.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Get with it, man. Nala of San Francisco? See, last week Ralph and I were having dinner at Il Fornaio, and she came over and started talking to us. Ralph knows her because she used to style-up the photo shoots for the ads he ran for his shows. You know the ads, I'll bet. I mean, you've probably seen them at one time or another. The real sexy ones--mostly naked men usually in some sort of acid-house rock-video styled scenes. Anyway, Ralph and Nala go way back. And she seemed to fall in love with me for some reason. She went back to her table and brought over Beilund Tajje, the photographer, and they joined us for dinner! By the time it was all over, Beilund and Nala told me that I had 'the look' that they were searching for and it would be grand if I would come and work with them and all. So this past weekend I spent with the two of them, and I brought along Rhea--they liked her, too. We went out to the coast. It was so nice out there, and we went through rolls and rolls of film. The shiner I got on Monday. And since I'm not in school for the rest of this week, I'll be going over to Nala's to get some fittings done.  You sure you don't know who Nala is?", "input": "", "output": "So you're going to be a fashion model? But are you going to be in these ads you've just described?"}, {"instruction": "You're always thinking smut, aren't you? No, no way! Nala owns two lines now. Attaboy designs...you know what those are? The ones that look sort of retro beatnik except with a lot of vibrant colors? Those are for the twenty-something guys. And of course there's her namesake line, \"Nala of San Francisco,\" where she's putting out a line of clothing that is best described as...what would you call it?", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid I'm not up on the latest fashion..."}, {"instruction": "Gothic! Goth-rock stuff, that's what I call it. But, oh man, it's so expensive. I don't know how anyone can afford any of it. But I guess people are buying it, so there's got to be a lot of money somewhere out there.", "input": "", "output": "It fits you well. Have you ever thought about doing this before?"}, {"instruction": "Why do you think I hate my father so much?", "input": "", "output": "Huh?"}, {"instruction": "A couple years before he died, I was doing modeling a little bit. I did some ads for the old Bullock's stores mainly, and I did a lot of live shows here in The City. I really liked doing it. But he hated the idea, made me feel like I was this small.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think he hated it so much?"}, {"instruction": "I guess he thought that it was making me a sissy. He'd say that only sissy-boys model, and he'd rant and rave like he ranted and raved about everything else. But he'd complain about the modeling thing all the time--I was getting so much attention and stuff. I remember one time, he and my grandmother were fighting about it and he hit her. He hit her! I was in shock, I guess, but that's what he did. So the next day, I was over at this woman's house--she used to manage me, I guess--and I told her that he died, because I wished him dead. She was so shocked that she wrapped her arms around me and cried.", "input": "", "output": "How did that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I really felt guilty about it. I mean about telling such a story. Then she went over to my house and offered her condolences to my grandmother. And then it came out that I lied, and I was in so much trouble. My grandmother told me she understood why I lied and why I was angry with him. But I was wrong and I knew it. I'll never forget what it was like to have all that come down, you know?", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you learned a valuable lesson. You mentioned something about Tony earlier. I was very concerned about your involvement in all that. What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Roly and I went up there to the house on Saturday, just like we planned. But the old man didn't go out, so we couldn't go in and get Tony. Marney was so mad when we came back. She went up to the house herself and tried to smash her way in. But the old guy called the cops and had us removed from the premises. Tony was helpless, and when I talked to him on the phone later, he told me that he got in big trouble over that. I'll bet the guy beat him up, but I don't know--I haven't seen him yet. But Marney...well, I never saw her like that. Later, we got into a huge yelling match out in the street over it. She wants him out of there. Her parents want him out. And I want him out, too. But going about it that way--causing a scene and all--well, that's blowing it, you know? We're going back this weekend. This time, Marney's coming with us, but I'm going to make her wait outside.", "input": "", "output": "This still concerns me. Concerns me a great deal, actually. Alex, have you thought about all the things that could go wrong? Does Tony realize that you are planning to get him out of there? Does he want to go himself?"}, {"instruction": "Don't get your shorts all twisted, dude. Yeah, I've thought about it. Hell, if the old man wants to fight someone, I'll take him on. But I have a feeling we won't have to worry about him. I'm more worried about what Marney will do. She has plane tickets back to France for the two of them, and her parents are waiting--we've been trying to keep them in France as long as possible. But they want to come out here, and that's just too many cooks in the kitchen, see? Tony just wants to get some space of his own: no Tim--that's the old fart's name--no Marney, no family. I think he's kind of embarrassed by all this--you know, what's become of him--and he doesn't really want to face his family yet. I can totally understand where he's coming from, you know? The most important thing is to keep our heads and everything will go smoothly. I just know it will. I just know it.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, why not get the authorities involved? If this man is beating up Tony, then the authorities..."}, {"instruction": "But Tony's an adult, see? That's the thing, isn't it? The old guy has been in a lot of trouble with the law for quite some time, according to some people I've spoken to. The thing is he gets away with it, or they don't have enough evidence, or the witness won't talk, or whatever. The police know who he is. That guy put a lot of people in the hospital, and he's not beating them up if you get my meaning...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Rough sex. He hurts people because he's real rough and he doesn't care if they get hurt. But no one will come forward and press charges against him, because he knows a lot of people in this town and people are really afraid of him. So he gets away with it. And I heard some really gross stories of how some guys needed a colostomy after he was done with them--he ripped their insides all up! Pretty sick dude, eh?", "input": "", "output": "That's a dangerous man, Alex. I am very concerned about you."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry, Doctor. Anyone ever tell you that you worry too much? I'll be fine. He can't hurt me. I mean I'm not going to have sex with him or anything like that, you know?", "input": "", "output": "But still, Alex, you are putting yourself at unnecessary risk by trying to save Tony. I would rather you got some professional help, a detective or..."}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay, enough already. You know you're not going to change my mind about this, so why are you even trying? I have to help my friend. And since he told me that he does want out, then I've got to help him despite himself. It's the least I can do. I mean it's not like I tried real hard to find him when he slipped away, you know? But that's enough of that subject, let's talk about my mom. I've finally figured out why she's so hateful about this pregnancy, why she's taking it out on me, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What do you think it's all about?"}, {"instruction": "When she was pregnant with me, she didn't want me. She still doesn't want me and she never did, that's no secret. Now she's all pregnant and has Mark here with her this time. And she's bound and determined to have this kid. I still think she's too old. I mean what's a thirty-two-year-old woman doing pregnant? She's too old!", "input": "", "output": "She's just thirty-two?  Alex, women are having children much later--even ten years older than you mom.  Your mother is in her prime child-bearing years. She's not too old for childbirth."}, {"instruction": "But the bitch shouldn't be having any more children, at this stage. I mean look at me. I'm almost seventeen and will be close to eighteen by the time it's born. That's too much of an age difference. Plus, when she was pregnant with me, she treated herself like shit--taking drugs and attempting to induce miscarriage and stuff like that. Now she's Pollyanna--taking the best care of herself, eating right, getting rest, and all that. The bitch wants this one. I'll bet she won't be tossing this one aside like she did with me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, has it ever occurred to you that your mother did you a favor when she gave you to her parents to raise as their son?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "She was unable or unwilling to care for you. Under those circumstances, I think she did the right thing."}, {"instruction": "You would. You never knew my grandparents, but that's another story. So what's your point? She would have tossed me into a garbage dumpster, if it weren't for them taking control of the situation. If my grandmother hadn't just taken me, who knows where I would have ended up? My point is this: she doesn't want me, she never did, and she never will. This baby she wants. She justifies her self-worth by what she thinks she's getting from men. Take Mark, for example. The only reason she wants his baby is because she has him to help her. You think she'd be able to do it alone? Well, think again.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did you put her name on your punching bag yet?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I did. Why?", "input": "", "output": "Just curious."}, {"instruction": "It'd great to concentrate on her when I'm punching that bag. Yeah. That's a plan, dude. It won't be hard, I can tell you that much.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Our time is up, Alex. I'll see you next week, same time?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Oh, no.  I need to miss next week.  Can it be the week after?", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  Something you want to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "Nah, it's bullshit, man.  Thanks for cutting me some slack.  I'll catch you later.", "input": "", "output": "Okay then, take care of yourself, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Always do, man. No one else is going to.", "input": "", "output": "And try to straighten things out in school--education rules in this world. Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Well, no, we didn't. Actually, I had to go back to school last week. But on Wednesday, Ralph took me to San Jose to see the Cirque du Soleil. That's why I didn't schedule an appointment for last week.", "input": "", "output": "How did you like the Cirque du Soleil? I hear it's very good."}, {"instruction": "It is...uh, I mean it was...it's amazing what those people can do. It's so athletic, you know? All the costumes and colors and movements they make--it's like a big Broadway production with the dance and drama thing. It is so cool, and it reminded me of my silly little fantasy of running away and joining the circus.", "input": "", "output": "Many people have this same fantasy."}, {"instruction": "Ah, yeah. But how realistic is it really? I mean I can't legally be recognized as a person until I'm eighteen. So even if I did do something so drastic, I wouldn't be able to make a living.  At least not legally, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Well Alex, I'm sure that whatever you put your mind to, you will succeed. And waiting until you're a legal adult isn't so bad, you'll be one before you know it. When do you turn eighteen anyway?"}, {"instruction": "January, nineteen ninety-nine. And that's a long way off by my calendar. Shit! They won't even let me try for my GED until November of next year!", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean? Who won't let you?"}, {"instruction": "The damned State of California, that's who! Their rule is that I must be seventeen years and ten months before I can take the test. And even then, if I were to take it and pass it, I wouldn't be able to get the diploma until I was eighteen. So what difference does it make? I could take the pretest and the preparation classes earlier, but I can't take the real test until then. By then, I'd just have under a year left of high school! They got us all by the balls, that's for sure!", "input": "", "output": "I understand your disappointment, Alex. Until then, there's plenty of time to get prepared for your life. A high school education--and I mean the one where you actually go to school, interact with others, and have a plotted out course of learning--is very important. And that kind of discipline can be very rewarding in it's own right."}, {"instruction": "Gee, Doctor, if I want discipline, I could always go over to Tony's house--he has a whole bunch of stuff that can be used for that!", "input": "", "output": "Tell me what happened there, with Tony?"}, {"instruction": "I guess you can say that things worked themselves out. We didn't have to go and rescue him after all. Well, we did go and everything, but he wasn't there--neither of them were there. See, as I suspected, Tony did get in trouble with Tim after Marney had her tirade on their front porch. That old dried-up asshole beat the shit out of Tony, and he needed medical care including a couple of nights in the hospital. But the best part is that the old fucker is dead!", "input": "", "output": "When? How? I mean, really?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently, after Tony went to the hospital--Tim took him to the emergency because Tony didn't stop bleeding for three days--Tim went on a crank binge, and according to what Tony told me, Tim was found dead in his doorway by a neighbor the very next day. His heart couldn't take it anymore. And you know what the funny thing is? For all the pain and suffering he caused, he ended up leaving everything to Tony: the house, and cars, and the business, too.", "input": "", "output": "He had a business?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I thought I told you that. He owns Paradise Leather on Polk. They make custom leather fashions--made to order stuff. It's the kind of place where you can go and design your own leather bustier or corset or anything else leather you can think of. Tony got it all--lock, stock, and barrel. He did pretty well for himself, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "It's a hell of a way to come across a fortune, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I know. But now, he can get the help he needs. He's up in St. Helena right now in a hospital for addiction, and I guess he'll be there for a while, you know? That crank is some pretty heavy shit! It takes a while to get it out of your system, and it's not going to be easy for him. It's the urge to do what's familiar that's going to be hard on him. And the HIV infection just adds to the pile of stuff to deal with, you know?", "input": "", "output": "It does complicate matters. It's a good thing that he has checked into a treatment program. Perhaps Roly can learn from his example."}, {"instruction": "Roly has a lot to learn, period! Man, you should see what he has become. I went over there to see him the other night, and he and I went to get some Chinese food. He's such a slob. I mean even livestock have better table manners. He eats with his mouth open and makes slurping noises and stuff. It's so pig-like that I can't stand it. It's the crank that does it to him, you know. It makes him not care about things, and he's so hyper all the time--he speaks so rapidly and loudly, as if he can't even hear himself. He needs to be where Tony is.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds very bad. But maybe seeing Tony get himself straightened out will give Roly some incentive to follow suit."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess so. Just don't put any money on that idea. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. I spoke to Sael the other day. Haven't seen him in a long time. He's been so busy with his premeds--that's what he calls them.", "input": "", "output": "He's going to be a doctor?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he says he wants to do sports medicine. So he's a paramedic by night, and by day he's in college getting himself ready for medical school. I think he wants to go back East somewhere to study. It was nice to hear from him. Oh yeah, and another weird thing happened this week. I told you that Benny's trial date was set, and they also set his bail--which he couldn't make...", "input": "", "output": "I don't recall that. So there's a trial date set?"}, {"instruction": "Not so fast, Doctor. I got a note in the mailbox the other day. It said: \"I know what you did.\" I'm thinking, \"What is that supposed to mean?\" But I didn't get a chance to even think twice about it before a letter came in the mail, and this time, it said not to testify against Benny or else. It said to forget everything that happened. I'm so over this now, you know? What can he or anybody do to stop me? I'm going to do it--to testify against him. I have to. I don't even have a choice anymore. It's what I got to do.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  The letters...that's real strange. Doesn't it bother you, Alex, that you've been threatened like this? Do you think that Benny is behind it?"}, {"instruction": "Who else? The thing I can't figure out is who put the first note in the mailbox? The first note was just slipped in the box, it wasn't mailed. And the second one was mailed from within the city. So he's got someone helping him. It reminds me of when my dad got all twisted up in some murder thing here. One day, he was in a restaurant, and these guys came in and shot the place all up, and he saw who it was. It was because of him that they were caught. But after that happened, we got threatening phone calls and dead animals in the mail and stuff. This marked the time when he went all weird on us and became the tyrant that I remember him to be. He was always paranoid that we were going to be killed or something, and he was always flying into a rage over something. He even carried a gun everywhere he went.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Was he that worried about the safety of his family?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure he was. But he surely didn't have to go and become a total asshole over it. He'd start in about the dumbest things--my modeling, for one thing.  And then there was this tutor I had. Dad said that I was being coddled--whatever that meant--but it was his idea in the first place to take me out of school and have a tutor come over. But what seemed to bug him most was when I'd get upset about something. See? I used to get real wimpy about things. And if I even started to act like I was going to cry, he would yell at me--which made everything worse of course. One time, he was teaching me how to ride a bike without training wheels. When I'd just started to wobble, he would grab a hold of the back of the bike, and shake it, and scold me for wobbling! I learned that with him--you do it his way and don't falter, or you're going to get it. He hated failure in anything. So obviously, I learned real fast how to keep my balance. It's a wonder I even like to ride these days, you know? He also hated the idea that I was a sissy-boy model who hung out with the girls all the time. He would have been real happy if I were the son he always wanted--one who liked to go out and get all dirty and didn't mind a little dirt under his fingernails. A guy who loved all sports not just baseball like me, but football--which I think is a pretty stupid game. I mean, what kind of a job is that anyway? A bunch of oversized guys with pea-sized brains jumping all over each other and getting hurt--sounds like the way I want to make a living! Plus, it looks so homo-erotic to me the way they pat each other on the butt. And the totally skin-tight uniforms--totally homo-erotic, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "What? What? I didn't like the man. He was a jerk! What's wrong with that?", "input": "", "output": "There's nothing wrong with that, Alex. It's just the way you describe him--a tyrant. And you said that he was this way with your grandmother, too?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess he was. But it was usually because of me--I was his biggest disappointment more than Larraine ever was. He didn't want a Nancy-boy for a son.", "input": "", "output": "A Nancy-boy?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, a fag, get it? A Nancy-boy, a friend of Dorothy's, whatever. I once looked at a grocery receipt and saw \"Homo milk\" on it and told him: \"See? That's why, you know? You've been feeding me Homo milk, is it any wonder?\" What a rage he went into over that comment, you know? It was priceless, I'm telling you!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure. So, Alex, you've never quite come out and said it before, but are you..."}, {"instruction": "Hello? I can see the lights are on, but no one's home! Where the hell have you been? You think that my sleeping with Benny would have tipped you off. Or the fact that most everyone I spend any time with were gays. So yes, I am gay. You have a problem with that?", "input": "", "output": "I knew you were, Alex, but I haven't heard you identify yourself specifically that way before, that's all. And no, I don't have a problem with it. Do you?"}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "Well, when I asked you specifically about it, you seemed to be on the verge of a rage yourself. So again, are you comfortable with being gay?"}, {"instruction": "Ah...well, I guess...I mean, I think I am. Why, uh...what do you mean am I comfortable? Of course I am. It's just that, well, it's just that I...I don't think the world is ready for a guy like me. I'm not a typical gay guy. I'm different. Most people don't assume that I'm gay, because I look so male, you know? I'm tall, and I have muscles, and I don't act all femme. It confuses people. Like it confused you, I guess. Most people seem to want an easy answer for everything. And if there is any ambiguity, then it's too much to handle.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it's a question that has crossed my mind several times. Maybe we can discuss this more next time. And in the meantime, you could think about it, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know what there is to think about or discuss. Gay is as gay does, right?", "input": "", "output": "You know what I mean."}, {"instruction": "Okay, we discussed it. End of subject!", "input": "", "output": "For now, because we are out of time. I'll see you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Same time, same place, new shit! Okay, man, see you!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor Balis! You'll never guess what just happened out there!", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. Please, sit down. What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, you know Katherine? This is so weird and cool, too! Anyway, she and I have been passing each other outside since I've started coming here later in a day. And today, she gave me this card. I'm so excited! See? I have this picture to show you, and I was looking at it. When Katherine came out of your office, she saw it and told me that her boyfriend--I think his name is Jake. Yeah, that's his name, see? It's on the card. Anyway, he manages an art gallery here in the city, and she told me to call him. Maybe I could show my work there! Isn't that so cool? I mean she was like totally nice to me and seemed really interested in my work, especially these little mosaic-like things I do. She's seen some of the other stuff I've brought before.  You know, besides maybe you and Ralph, no one else has ever been interested in my drawings and stuff?", "input": "", "output": "That's very interesting news, Alex. That was nice of Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she seems so...I don't know, maybe different. Yeah, different from a lot of women I know, particularly my mother. She seems like the kind of person who wouldn't need someone else to make her feel like a complete person, you know? I mean she's not like a bitch, but you can tell she means business. Or at least she really means what she says, but I'll bet she doesn't act like a bitch about it either. Does that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "I think I follow you, Alex. You seem to be very taken by her."}, {"instruction": "Well, yes...I mean, no...I mean...well, I don't know what I mean. She's totally cool, okay? How often does someone like that come into your life and show interest? Usually older people don't even notice I'm around unless I light myself on fire or something. And then Katherine comes along and...well, I think I could really get into a woman like that, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I don't mean like date her, but maybe as a friend. Oh, I don't know. I wish my mom was more like that. You know--had her shit together and stuff? But it's so cool! Maybe I'll become a famous artist or something. Who knows? And since the modeling thing isn't going to work for me, well maybe then this will be a good opportunity.", "input": "", "output": "I encourage you to pursue it, Alex. Why isn't the modeling working out for you?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I forgot to tell you about that. Well, remember I told you about Nala and Beilund? They wanted me to help them during the Macy's Passport show a few weeks ago--the weekend that Tony went to St. Helena. They had me in the dressing area backstage and these guys--these models...I mean, men--they were so wrong! This one guy was treating me like I was a slave, and that didn't sit too well with me. Each time he came back to change, he would talk down to me. And finally, after about ten nasty comments, I got pissed at him and gave it to him good.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Alex..."}, {"instruction": "I kind of gave him a black eye.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you don't just kind of give someone a black eye..."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I punched him out. But he deserved it--he was such a jerk treating me like that. So Nala told me that runway--or catwalk or whatever they call it--isn't going to work because I need to be able to take shit like that. And then the print work they seemed to have for me suddenly disappeared soon after. I guess they didn't like me to stand up for myself. But that jerk deserved it, you know? He even told me that he deserved it himself, so go figure.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, this is the reason you came here in the first place--to work out these anger issues that get you into trouble. Remember the mindfulness exercises we did?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I do. And?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you're going to be facing difficult issues like this for the rest of your life. It's important to learn now how to deal with things that make you angry. If you go around punching people because they upset you, you'll end up an outcast and in jail. There are times and ways to stand up for yourself in a socially acceptable and responsible manner. Do you understand?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I get what you mean. But you don't understand--what if they deserve it?", "input": "", "output": "What if everybody went around punching each other out?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "This guy was testing you. You tested me in the beginning of our relationship here, remember? He wanted to see how far he could go, to see what he could get away with, you see?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess. But...", "input": "", "output": "You didn't gain anything by punching him out, did you? In fact, you lost out on a chance for a modeling career with Nala. You gave in to your impulses and lost. You see how important it is to think things out before acting? Take the guy at your school--the one who gave you a shiner..."}, {"instruction": "Tommy. And? So?", "input": "", "output": "Tommy gave into his impulse, too. Did you enjoy having a black eye? Of course not. Do you see what I'm getting at? Sometimes, doing nothing is the best defense. Getting suspended from school for fighting was yet another way your impulses worked against you."}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay. Enough already. I get it, man. Think first, then punch!", "input": "", "output": "No! That's not what I'm saying."}, {"instruction": "I know. I was just playing with you. But sometimes, I think I can't control it, you know? It just overcomes me--I get pissed and then I go off.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still using the punching bag?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, just about every day lately. This thing with Tony...and now Roly is out on the streets. Well, it's all gotten to me. It's like the world has gone crazy. Oh, yeah, and I almost forgot. You remember the letter I told you about? Well, whoever is doing that did it again. Only this time, they sent a photo. This has been real weird--the picture they sent was one of those gay porn ads. It looked a lot like kiddy porn, and it had Ralph pretty upset. We turned it and the other stuff over to Cecil. Ralph figured that the sooner the lawyer gets involved the better. He's pretty worried over it.", "input": "", "output": "Doesn't it worry you, too?"}, {"instruction": "Why should it? I know that Benny is behind it, and there's nothing he can do to keep me from testifying. I'm going to do it--he's totally going to fry, you know? But Cecil went over to the district attorney and gave them everything I got so far. I guess they plan to have a chat with Benny about it.", "input": "", "output": "It's good that you got the lawyer involved. Maybe they need to watch Benny closer."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, I figure what goes around, comes around, you know? I've seen Karma do it's deed too many times. Like my dad, for instance--he got just what he deserved. And it wasn't a moment too soon.", "input": "", "output": "Let's talk about him some more. Last week you told me a story about the bike. You've told me a lot of other negative things about your grandfather, Alex. Do you have any positive memories of him?"}, {"instruction": "No. Ah, now...well, I can think of one happy moment with him.", "input": "", "output": "Would you care to tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "Before he witnessed that murder, we had a pretty good life, I think. At least I don't really remember him going off like he did. But there was this thing we used to do--it was in the early spring when the winds were high. My parents used to take me down to Montara Mountain, and we would fly kites up there. This one day--I remember because we climbed up to the highest peak--the clouds were all puffy and white, and the sky was real deep blue. The mountains seemed to roll on forever, and I remember the big butterflies that used to flutter around--Monarchs, I think. Not many of those these days, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "So anyway, I must have been around six--I was still a little guy. But what I remember most is laughing and my dad running around getting the kite to go higher and higher. He had a huge smile. I don't really remember why that day sticks out in my mind so much, except that we were all real happy then. Long car drives up and down the coast, the smell of his cigarettes in the car...my grandmother used to just stare at him with these little stars in her eyes--he was very good-looking, even the cat used to stare at him. I loved it when he picked me up and held me close. I felt...I felt safe. But, I think that...uh...uh, I don't know why I'm getting all weird about this, but...oh, shit!", "input": "", "output": "Here, Alex. Take some tissues. This is a memory that evokes some very strong emotion in you."}, {"instruction": "No, shit! Damnit! I wish I wouldn't puss-out like that.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you're safe here, and anything you feel is right. It's okay to have sad or mixed feelings about your grandfather. He played an important part of your life."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well...he's gone now, so I don't have to worry about him anymore.", "input": "", "output": "The memories you have of that happy time will always be inside you. Sometimes it's good to remember that it wasn't always bad."}, {"instruction": "Well, I try not to think of him at all. You're the one who wanted to know more. Thanks a lot!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Well, you know better than anyone else that he has been on my mind quite a lot lately. I don't know why, though.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay. It's just what you're thinking now."}, {"instruction": "It just is...hmm, I like that. It just is.", "input": "", "output": "It's a good way to look at some things in life--they just are. It helps to put things in perspective."}, {"instruction": "Perspective...talk about it. You know, Roly is out on the streets now? He's homeless. Got his butt kicked out of that dump in the Tenderloin. And since he's persona non grata with his dad, he has no money except for the bucks he hustles and even that's getting harder for him. He's like a crazy person. I gave him some money the other day. He got his front tooth knocked out last week. He was sleeping under the freeway down there off Third Street, and these people came in and started rummaging through everyone's stuff. Roly tried to stop them. Well, he got himself all beat up. Now, he looks like a crazy person--like any other dirty, messed-up, crazy homeless. Ralph doesn't want him around the house. And between you and me, neither do I. You know, that could've been me out there? That was me for a while. This really gives me some perspective on my situation. Shit, if it weren't for Ralph, I could be out there, too, you know? But if Roly keeps this up...well, he's heading for a big fall, and he's desperate for some speed. I just got to stay away from him, you know? I hate to say that, but I think my gut feeling is totally right on the mark this time.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear about Roly. I can tell this is hard on you."}, {"instruction": "No one wants to see someone they care about be such a big fuck-up. But I realize that there isn't anything I can do for him anymore.", "input": "", "output": "It's admirable that you want to help Roly. But Roly needs to want to be helped, so your insight is probably correct in this case, unfortunately. He may need to hit rock bottom before anyone can help him."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, I hope that it won't be too late for him. Tony is lucky, but Roly...well, I'm not so sure that anything good is going to come out of it. I can't stand to be around him too much anymore...enough of that. I know we're out of time, so here are the drawings I wanted to show you. These are the rough-drafts I did, and then I did them over again but much larger. The big ones I think I'll bring over to that guy Jake. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "I think you should, Alex. I'm interested in what might happen. So I'll see you next week. And, Alex, good work today."}, {"instruction": "Thanks a lot, man. I mean for your encouragement and all. It really means a lot to me. See you later, dude!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. Are you feeling all right?"}, {"instruction": "It shows, eh? I think I'm coming down with something...I don't know. But my stomach has been all gurgly lately, and it seems like the cold air is effecting me more than normal. This chill air seems early this year. But I don't know. I'm feeling sort of low, I guess. Maybe it's this change in the weather.", "input": "", "output": "The seasonal change does effect people, Alex. But there's a lot going around, too."}, {"instruction": "I thought there was. Ralph isn't feeling too well these days either. But I've been blaming it on our nerves. We've both been in bad moods lately, you know? We're getting pissed off over the little things--the CD player breaking, Ralph's freshly washed car getting dirty too fast. Stupid stuff, you know? Me? Well, I seem to be having a lot of self-doubts about things.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "You'd think I'd be a little more excited about having a real professional look over my artwork. But I'm more nervous about it, and it never really mattered all that much to me before. Well, maybe it did matter to me, but I never thought that this would happen. So I'm kind of wondering if my work is good enough now, you know? I mean, you should see the work in that place--the Range Galleries. It's some really cool stuff, and my work is very different from what I saw there. So I think that it's probably not good enough. I'm expecting Jake to call me and tell me to come and get my stuff and not to come back.", "input": "", "output": "I see. You're really having a lot of self-doubts. Have you asked yourself why you are feeling this way? Where did these ideas come from?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I really don't. It's just...it's, uh...well, I can't figure it out. People aren't supposed to be able to do this sort of thing. It just doesn't seem possible that my work would interest anyone enough to buy it.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you're only seventeen years old. Give yourself a chance. Not many wanted to buy Van Gogh's work during his lifetime."}, {"instruction": "I know, but...", "input": "", "output": "What is it?"}, {"instruction": "You know what this makes me think of? It makes me remember my dad telling me that boys don't color and draw. He used to say that was for girls and that no one can ever be able to make enough money doing art to live on. But art is what I think I could do well as a job, you know? Maybe cartooning or stuff like that. Or these things. I call them mosaics, but I really had stained glass in mind when I was painting them. I imagine my illustrations in a children's book or on greeting cards...postcards, maybe. I don't know. But see? Something in my head keeps reminding me of what my dad said about art. It really bugs me, because it just won't stop. But I bet that Jake'll call me and tell me to come get my stuff, and then he'll show me the door--see, I've got it all figured out.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you don't know what will happen with Jake. Try to be patient and wait for him to get back to you.  And even if Jake's reaction to your work is not positive, it doesn't mean you should give up art all together.  Artists create because they have to, not because they think they can sell their work.  It's nice to be able to make a living selling art, but that's not the only goal of an artist.  As for your dad, he's wrong.  There are plenty of successful male artists.  In fact, for many years, art was almost exclusively a male trade.  And even now...take Arthur Rackham, for example."}, {"instruction": "He did \"Alice in Wonderland,\" didn't he?", "input": "", "output": "He did! And Maxfield Parrish."}, {"instruction": "He's my favorite!", "input": "", "output": "Is he?  Unfortunately, your father tried to misinform you on the subject of art."}, {"instruction": "You know, that man's mouth keeps opening up from the grave and tells me shit. I hate him so much! He thought that people who are gay chose to be gay. But it isn't a choice at all. Most guys I know wouldn't choose it. There's too much bad stigma attached to that label. Shit, I don't tell people at school that I'm gay, because it's just not cool, especially in San Mateo. They aren't as gay-friendly down there as they are up here in the City.", "input": "", "output": "Does your family know that you're gay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, they do. And I think they're okay with it. If they aren't, they don't let on. I think Aunt Sofie is the coolest about it, you know? She had a son who was gay--Randy. He was my mom's age, but he died from complications related to AIDS. I never knew him. He was one of the early ones who never had a chance. By the way, she's home from the hospital now. Did I tell you that already? She's staying with Mom and Mark and the girls. It's a full house again. She and Mark did a stupid thing though.", "input": "", "output": "Your Aunt Sofie and Mark?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. You know what they tried to do? They tried to get me and my mom to make up. It backfired. Totally backfired.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my mom's starting to really show now. Her belly is really popping out, and she's completely a bitchy thing, more than ever. Well, Aunt Sofie and Mark planned a dinner. So Ralph and I went over to the house, and everyone was there having a nice dinner. Things were cool, you know? So when it came time to do the dishes, Mark and I started cleaning up. And then Aunt Sofie came in...well, the details aren't important. My mom came in and didn't like the way I was stacking the dishes in the dishwasher. She started huffing and puffing and snorting like a pig, and we exchanged words--I was all over her: \"Fuck this shit! Fuck you!\" Oh, and I got the rest of the shit on Mark's wife--the one up in Canada. She's in a mental hospital, completely Loony Toons, out of her head. Rhia told me something about her being schizo. It's just what we need in our lives! A damned schizo. Why her and my mom could...no, no, no! I got to stop thinking like that.", "input": "", "output": "Like what, Alex?"}, {"instruction": "Aw, don't get your tit in a tether, okay? I'm not going to hurt anyone or anything like that. I would really like to get along with her, and I try...I mean, I did go over to the house for a family thing like they all wanted me to. But then she started on me for trying to help out. You can always count on her getting pissed about something. She's such a perfectionist, and I don't have to take her shit, you know? She hates me. I just don't get along with her, that's all. But I know she hates me, the bitch. And now she's getting fat!", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps it might be best to limit your interaction with your mother for now, while she's pregnant.  Pregnancy can cause a lot of physical as well as emotional changes in a woman. And your mom also has to deal with your half-sister, Mark, and your Aunt Sofie."}, {"instruction": "You think I don't already know that? The little time I spend with her now is too much already. And with all the other things going on in my own life right now, I don't need her negative nagging bullshit. Cecil called last night. They talked with Benny about the threats and crap in the mail and stuff. He denies it all, of course. But I know better, and so do they. Ralph and I haven't gotten anything so far this week. So maybe the little talk they had with Benny made him think, you know? Hey! I just remembered! You want to know something funny? Remember that guy? Remember the model at the fashion show I punched out? He called me and asked me out on a date. Can you believe it? I was like, \"What did you ask me?\" So I thought that this dude just wanted some revenge, you know? But it turned out that wasn't it at all.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "You mean, did I go out with him? Yes, I did! And you know what the funny part was? We hit it off! He still had a little bruising around his eye. But when I saw him again, he was different--not in a model mode. He looked different, relaxed maybe. He was like...how do I describe him? He was smart and funny. He seemed to be able to finish my sentences and answer me before I said anything. It was too weird. But I like him, and I'm going to go out with him again this weekend.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that it went so well."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, me too. I just hope that he doesn't want to have sex with me or something.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, this is going to sound strange, but I don't think I want to go there right now. I don't want that kind of relationship for now. I just want to have fun. But he's so handsome in a rugged sort of way--like a young Tom Selleck. And sometimes, I think that sex would be good. But I don't...I don't know. I don't feel comfortable about it.", "input": "", "output": "If you feel that way, then you should let him know about it. It's always best to be up front and honest about your feelings, especially while you're dating someone. It's smart to think about these things beforehand."}, {"instruction": "I really like him a lot and can see something more coming of it, if I don't blow it. I don't want to disappoint him, though.", "input": "", "output": "If he doesn't respect your feelings, then it is probably best that it comes out now rather than later."}, {"instruction": "But isn't it funny? He worked me over real bad that day, and I went and punched him out. And now, he wants to date me. I think that he liked me from the beginning and, like you said, was testing me. Sparks flew! They really flew, and then they flew again the other night, but in a better way. And you know what's even better? He's only seventeen.", "input": "", "output": "That's good, Alex."}, {"instruction": "It is. Since he isn't over eighteen, neither of us can get into trouble over this, and that's cool. He's the first person my age that I've ever gone out with, you know? Most people in my age group are still so...I don't know. Immature I guess. But not Luke. He's different, and he has pretty good sense of humor about the black eye. I know we're almost out of time, so I want to show you another drawing. These are all the rough drafts. Jake has all the finished ones right now. God, I hope he likes them. But it doesn't matter if he does or not, huh? But I'm still real nervous about it.", "input": "", "output": "Let's hope for the best. Well, Alex, next week then?"}, {"instruction": "All right, man. Catch you later on.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. Sorry I'm late. I took the bus, and we were caught in traffic.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. You're only a few minutes late. You look like you're feeling better this week."}, {"instruction": "I am, but Ralph's not. He's real sick; it got him bad. It hasn't been the greatest week at home--Ralph's been hurling big time, and I'm stuck cleaning up after him. It hasn't been pretty. He went to the doctor, and it's just the bug going around--an early flu thing, I think. But I wish he'd get better already. I'm getting sick of this, you know?", "input": "", "output": "That's too bad about Ralph, but I'm glad you're not sick. Cleaning up after him is certainly no fun, but I do remember you telling me how Ralph cleaned up after you recently."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he reminded me of that, too. Funny how we forget stuff like that, huh? I went out with Luke again. Actually, we went out three times last weekend. Friday, we went out dancing. Saturday, bike riding. And on Sunday, we hung out in the Castro. I'm almost afraid to say it, but I really like him a lot. And he seems to like me a lot, too.", "input": "", "output": "Why are you afraid to say it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I think if I say it too much or if I even think it enough, he'll figure out who I am and then go away from me.", "input": "", "output": "I don't understand. Are you unable to be yourself with him?"}, {"instruction": "No! That's not it. I'm okay with that. I've told him all about myself. The questions he's asked I've answered and stuff like that. But if he really gets to know me, then he won't want to be with me anymore. The only thing I haven't told him about is the Benny thing. Well, he knows that I had something with someone before, but I didn't tell him any details. I just know that it's going to scare him off, I just know it will.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think it may scare him away?"}, {"instruction": "Well, think about it. It's a lot of baggage to be carrying around. And what if Benny gets out? Better yet, what happens when he gets out? See? It would scare me away.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I think it would be a good idea to tell him a little about this. After all, you mentioned to me that the court date is approaching, and that could be stressful..."}, {"instruction": "Stressful? Tell me about it. Cecil called and told me that Benny got himself a lawyer now--no more public defender. And they got a doctor--a shrink, like you--and they petitioned the court for a hearing on whether he's fit to stand trial. In the meantime, they've moved him back into the psycho ward again. So he's got himself a delay and all. I'm so pissed. It's so unfair that he isn't getting what he deserves. I keep thinking that I'll wake up and he's going to be there, waiting for me and he's going to...he's...uh...", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. Just take a few deep slow breaths, that's it. Okay. I understand how all this can be upsetting, Alex."}, {"instruction": "You're telling me? It makes me see cross-eyed when I think about it all. It's not fair! It's not!", "input": "", "output": "I know it's not fair, Alex. Unfortunately, there isn't anything we can do about these delays. But keep in mind that the delays give everyone, including you, more time to prepare for trial. So it's not necessarily as bad as it seems."}, {"instruction": "I just want it to be over. I'm so over this now, you know? So over it.", "input": "", "output": "I know. Now, we were talking about Luke.  The trial is a big thing to try to hide from someone you want to be close with. You were upset just telling me abut the delays. I think it's best if you tell Luke at least a little about the trial.  Otherwise it might lead to miscommunication and misunderstanding.  And those are dangerous in a budding relationship."}, {"instruction": "I just think it...that it may backfire or something. What if he thinks it's too much to get involved in and turns away from me?", "input": "", "output": "And what if he doesn't? We talked about this last week; you can't predict the future or what other people are going to say or do. That's too much energy and emotion spent on what we can't control."}, {"instruction": "But I really like him. I really, really do.", "input": "", "output": "Put yourself in Luke's shoes for a moment and think what you would do if he confessed to something so important and serious. What would you do?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'd want to help him. I'd help him in any way I could even if that just meant being there for him.", "input": "", "output": "There you go. There's your answer. If he likes you as much as you like him, then that's what he'll do. And remember how you feel about secrets?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I had enough secrets kept from me. I know. I just don't want to blow it, you know? I talked to Ralph about it, and he sort of said pretty much the same thing as you. Only he said to maybe wait and see how the relationship goes before I give him all the gory details. It's a lot to keep inside of me. Shit! It really has been on my mind, this Benny bullshit. When I got those notes in the mail, I thought, for some weird reason, that maybe I didn't get all the tapes he made--the ones he made of me, I mean. I thought for a split second that one would turn up suddenly. Wouldn't that be a surprise? But I know I got all the tapes, so I don't even know where that idea came from. And Cecil said the same thing about the court delays, too--we have more time to plan now. He calls it \"coaching.\" He's training me how to act when they call me to the stand--how to answer the questions and what questions might come up, stuff like that.", "input": "", "output": "It's important to be as prepared as possible. It can be very trying, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Don't I already know that. I thank Ralph everyday for that punching bag. My arms are getting bigger, and I can go a lot longer on it than before. Luke was quite impressed. He impressed me, too. When we went cycling, he kept up with me pretty well. We went all the way up to the top of Twin Peaks; too bad it was so foggy though. I love that ride. I do a big circle. I usually start my ride at home on Saturn Street. Then I ride past mom's on Seventeenth and over to Alamo Square. Then I cross over Market and over to Delores Park, zigzagging through the streets and back alleys all the way up to the top of Twin Peaks. It usually takes about two and a half hours, but with Luke I took it easy.", "input": "", "output": "Very impressive. I'm exhausted just thinking about it! That's quite a ride, and you built up to that quickly. I'm impressed."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Sometimes, I think how lucky I am to be able to do that and to live, you know? I just love this city. There's always so much to do. It's almost impossible to do the same thing twice. Did I tell you about Jake at the Range Gallery?", "input": "", "output": "We talked about it last week. What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I saw Jake again last Thursday, and he had a lot of things to say about my work. Damn! I wished I had run into Katherine, I wanted to tell her about this. Oh well, I guess Jake will tell her.", "input": "", "output": "I'm very curious to know what Jake thought of your work."}, {"instruction": "Well, he had a lot of good things to say, and he gave me some names and numbers. First of all, he took two of the finished pieces, cut some mats for them, and hung them up in the gallery. He took \"Man's Best Friend\"--that's what I called it. I brought the rough draft of that one with me today, I'll show you later. And he took the one with the genie, too. He said he'd show it around to other people and see if anyone's interested. So I agreed to leave my work with him for as long as he wants. But he was also very critical of my art, which I didn't expect. He also told me to go over to this place South of Market: Early Books, a book publisher he knows. They do children's books. There's a girl named Esther there who may be able to match me up with a writer, and we could team up and do a book. That's the most exciting part. A book! A children's book! It's what I think my style is best suited for, and that's what Jake thought, too. He is so interesting, very business-like, but warm, too. I can see what Katherine sees in him, I think. If he was...well, I don't want to go there. But she's got herself a good man there.", "input": "", "output": "I'm very happy for you, Alex. I'm glad it went so well."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Jake likes my style and everything, but he recommended me to use better quality stuff--better paper and drawing materials.  He said that would really make a difference in the way my work would look, but I didn't tell Ralph that--he was the one who bought all the stuff in the first place. Jake also told me to go see this other guy who photographs and scans images. That way I can have a permanent record of my work and get cards made up--like I told you before I wanted to do. So, yes, it did go pretty well. But no promises were made by either of us, and we'll just see what happens from here.", "input": "", "output": "That's great news, Alex. I'm very proud of you. It's something to be excited about."}, {"instruction": "I am, but I'm not. Somehow, I'm waiting for it all to fall apart or something. I don't know. He--Jake, I mean--took me around the gallery and showed me other artists' work. We talked about color, and he gave me ideas on how to improve my use of it. These rough drafts tell it all. Sometimes, my colors become monotonous and blend together too much. Or more simply, I use very similar colors in one piece, so the tones all sort of blend together. I didn't see that before. Oh yeah, and you know what's funny? He gave me the number of Selvin James.", "input": "", "output": "I don't recognize the name."}, {"instruction": "He isn't anyone famous or anything like that. He's the friend that Ralph brought over a few months ago. Remember? The one who I felt uncomfortable with? He used to teach at the now closed De Young art school. He retired from there before it closed down. He used to teach painting and color theory. Small world, huh? So Ralph and I are going to have him over for dinner later this week, if Ralph is feeling better by then. We can talk about some lessons for me. Ralph said that Selvin would teach me for free--no strings attached. But I think it's better if we pay him something. He's old, and he must not have very much--you should see the old clunker he drives around in. So Aunt Sofie is going to get mom to cough up some money to give this guy. I figure that way we both gain something.", "input": "", "output": "I think taking art lessons is a good idea.  I hope this man works out for you.  But if not, there are plenty of other opportunities."}, {"instruction": "I figure that as long as I can learn something, I'm living life to the fullest, you know?", "input": "", "output": "That's a good attitude, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I'll probably be a student all my life.", "input": "", "output": "We're just about out of time for today. Did you have something to show me?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Here it is. \"Man's Best Friend.\" You can keep that one.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks, Alex. I will. See you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, dude. See you then!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. How are you doing this week?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess. Gosh, I wonder what bug crawled up her butt? Katherine just brushed past me like I wasn't even there. I don't know--I guess I'm not so good, really.", "input": "", "output": "You look a bit tired. Have you been getting enough sleep? What's going on?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's been a weird week. And I mean real weird. Since Benny has got himself that delay we talked about, I've been having trouble sleeping again. But it's okay, really, because I've been spending more time painting. That's what I've been doing when I can't sleep--paint. It keeps my mind off him, and I'm able to do the work that I want to do. I got myself some good paints and started this huge painting--stippling, sort of. It's a bunch of splat-like dots, and it's real big. I picked out a six by four feet board. I'm doing a car, but that's beyond the point. I'm just stressing.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that you're able to spend your sleepless time productively, but I also want you to get the sleep you need. Have you tried taking the medication I previously prescribed for insomnia?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't even thought about it. But you know the weirdest thing that happened? This thing with Jake and my artwork has been bugging me.", "input": "", "output": "You sounded so positive last week; what's bothering you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's just...it's like...oh, I don't know. I'm not ready for it. I followed Jake's advice and went down to that publisher and met Esther--she's the one that runs that place. It's a small publishing company. So I showed her my work, and we talked for awhile. We really hit it off. She's so cool, you know? She's very eclectic, kind of like a gypsy. Anyway, she and I were talking, and she told me that I wasn't ready. She didn't say it in a bad way, she just said that I needed more experience, more training. So I think Jake was humoring me, you know? He was trying to make me feel good about myself. And the finished pieces he has are real good, you know? It kind of surprised me how good they turned out.  They are much better than the small rough drafts I showed you. And it totally surprised me that he hung them up. But Esther said I needed to get more work under my belt and get some professional training. She knew Selvin and said that he's one of the best art teachers around and that I need to really take advantage of his knowledge. She even said that Jake is too generous sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I think Esther gave you very good advice.  I'm not an artist, but I think that with training and art classes, your work would certainly improve. But I wouldn't assume right away that Jake was just trying to humor you. He probably did like your work."}, {"instruction": "So Esther and I did some painting together last weekend, and she helped me to see that I'm really not prepared for a professional art career at this point. I brought her over to the house and showed her my stippling. She seemed real impressed. Sometimes the work I do surprises even me--that I did it, I mean, that it came out of these hands. Did I really do that? But Esther was real honest and upfront with me, and she encouraged me to push forward. So now, when I can't sleep, I paint. The painting is almost finished now, and I just started it last week. This is the biggest thing I've done so far.", "input": "", "output": "I'm looking forward to seeing it or at least a picture of it, I guess. But I do want to encourage you to take your medication when you're having trouble sleeping. Do you still have any left?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I don't know, dude. I don't want to feel drugged.", "input": "", "output": "The medication I prescribed is very mild and shouldn't make you feel that way. It will, however, help you to get the rest you need. I'm just worried about you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I don't feel bad, though. And there's more on my mind. One night, I was feeling tired of painting, so I watched TV. I saw one of those commercials for the psychics, you know? Well, I called one for kicks, but this woman, the psychic, told me some interesting stuff. She said that there was someone in my life that felt tremendous guilt over something that happened between us. I think that must be Benny. Well, I got quite a surprise after that. Remember I told you that Ralph was sick with the flu? The next morning after heaving his guts out again, Ralph sat me down and said that he had to talk to me about something. And I thought: \"Oh no, here it comes. He's going to throw me out.\" Well, he told me that he really liked me staying there with him and that I was welcome to stay as long as I want to. But the kicker is that he said the same thing months ago--when I first met him and did that buttered white bread thing for him. He said that he really thought that I was much older then. He said that if he knew my real age, he wouldn't have asked me to do that or go to his house. He said that he felt real guilty about that. See? And I don't even believe in all that psychic shit. Pretty weird, huh?", "input": "", "output": "So you think the psychic woman from TV meant Ralph?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  Don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "I think it was good of Ralph to try to talk to you about that stuff."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but the weird part is yet to come. Ralph never once wanted to have sex with me. Not then and not now. And, as far as I know, he hasn't had anyone else over for that since. So I asked him about it. You know what he told me? He's sick. He's impotent, and he's sick. He has AIDS! AIDS! I was like: \"No way, dude.\" But he has been HIV positive for almost ten years now. He's on that Crixovan cocktail combo, and he's doing pretty well. Well, at least better than he did before when he almost died. That stuff hides any infection pretty well. Ralph was able to hide it from me--the drugs and the doctor appointments and all that. He hid it all from me. He said he thought that if I knew, I would run out on him. And he said that having me as a companion has been the best thing for him. I was so freaked, man. I told him that his being HIV positive doesn't and won't scare me off. But I also told him that now I was scared.", "input": "", "output": "What are you afraid of, Alex?"}, {"instruction": "He's going to die on me, Doc. He's going to die, and then I'm all alone again. I don't want him to die. I want him to stay here with me and not leave. But I know he's going to go away just like everyone else. He's going to leave me here by myself. Oh, why do people do that? Why do they get sick? I wish I could do something to make him better, but I can't.", "input": "", "output": "You're doing a lot for him, Alex.  You're a good companion and a good friend.  Ralph is lucky to have you around. Having HIV today is not the same as having HIV just a year or two ago. People who were once on the brink of death have made stunning comebacks with the new and highly successful drugs that have just came out on the market.  It sounds like Ralph is doing very well. Now the flu he has is bothersome. Did Ralph say that it was a side effect or a complication due to HIV?"}, {"instruction": "He said that it's not, but I don't really know. He seems to think the virus is gone--that this cocktail thing has chased it away. But if that was true, then people wouldn't still be dying, you know? He insists that his viral load is undetectable, but I have trouble believing that.", "input": "", "output": "It's true that some HIV infected people now are showing no symptoms and their viral loads are down and their T-cell counts have increased. Right now, as long as the regimented drug therapy is continued, the most successful cases seem to be very stable."}, {"instruction": "But I just know he's going die on me. I just...well, it's like I can't...uh, I'm real worried that he's going to die!", "input": "", "output": "I understand how you feel. You have experienced a lot of loss in your life..."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what to do. I walked all over town that day and half the night, too. I can't abandon him; he needs me as much as I need him. I talked to Luke about it, and he said that having me live with Ralph probably really helps him--it gives him another reason to carry on. You know, Ralph doesn't have anyone. His parents have been gone for years, and he has no brothers or sisters or any other family that I know of. I'm all he's got, and that's almost too much for me to handle. But I can't just leave him. It wouldn't be right, not after all he's done for me. With Tony up in St. Helena, and Roly in la-la land somewhere out there in the streets, it's like I have no one left either. We need each other--I can't let him die.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm afraid that this is something well beyond your control. I know that the uncertainty is very hard on you, Alex. But none of us  can predict the future. Ralph may live a long and full life. Going about worrying when he will die will just make you anxious. My best advice is to carry on like you have. Someday soon, HIV may be treated and regarded just like diabetes is now--with proper drug therapy, it will be under control, and the patient will be able to expect to live a fairly normal life. Be there for him, Alex, and let him be there for you, too."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...", "input": "", "output": "But to do that, you need to care of yourself, too. You've got to get some sleep. Take the quazepam I prescribed"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It's just that the drug thing kind of scares me, too. You know?", "input": "", "output": "It's perfectly normal to feel that way. But I wouldn't prescribe it to you if I thought it would hurt you. Please do take it if you continue to lose sleep. Are you able to keep up with your school work?"}, {"instruction": "Shit, that stuff is so boring--I could've done that crap when I was five years old. You should see what they teach now--such useless shit. But yes, I get it done before I even get home each day. And my grades are good, so it's not affecting that.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, then. I suggest you get some current literature on AIDS and HIV. The StopAIDS project may be a good place to start or the San Francisco Aids Foundation, they are very good, too."}, {"instruction": "I'll check them out. Oh, yeah. I brought another drawing for you. I call this one \"Performance Anxiety.\" See? He's got a cello. My grandmother used to play one in a symphony or something. I still have her cello, but don't know how to play it. I used it as a model for this drawing. Just about every piece of work I do involves something I either own or something I do. I started to do some animated drawings of Ralph's cats, too. I can't stop thinking of ideas for my next piece of work, and I don't seem to have enough time for it all.", "input": "", "output": "Well, keep up the good work, Alex. As you've figured out, keeping oneself productive is a good way to ease one's mind. And get some rest."}, {"instruction": "I'll try.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Okay, dude, catch you later.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye. And Alex?"}, {"instruction": "Yes?", "input": "", "output": "If you need anything, please call."}, {"instruction": "Thanks a lot, man. Later!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. You don't want to ask, but I know you will anyway. It's been one hell of a week!", "input": "", "output": "What's going on, Alex? Why are you limping?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I've been walking a lot again. When I found out about Ralph, I sort of walked, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "I don't understand.  Did you move out?"}, {"instruction": "No, no. No, I just went out for a walk...for two days.", "input": "", "output": "Huh? I missed something. What happened to Ralph? Are you talking about Ralph having AIDS?"}, {"instruction": "No. I mean, yes. No! No, I mean, no! Shit! Ralph went into the hospital last Wednesday. That's why I called and canceled at the last minute. He fucking went into the hospital! I was looking at him lying there in his hospital bed, his skin was all parched, and it looked like it was sagging or something. I was sure he was going to die on me. Right then and there, he was going to die. I just knew he was going to...just, ah...go! So, I went out for a walk and didn't go back until late Friday night. And then, they wouldn't let me in to see him, so I walked some more. I was so out of it, that I wasn't paying attention to the time. I walked up to Crissy Field, and then over that Golden-God-Damned Bridge, and right down into Sausalito before I realized even where I was. It was like I was sleep walking or something. It's a fucking miracle I didn't get run over by a car. And my ankles are still killing me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry about Ralph, Alex. But I'm also worried about you. Were you aware of your surrounding at all during these walks? Do you remember what was going on in your head?"}, {"instruction": "Ralph was going on in my head! I was thinking about Ralph and what I was going to do and stuff like that. Yeah, I knew what I was doing and where I was, if that's what you mean. I do remember certain things that stood out. Like the woman who was looking for her little kid that she lost somehow. How does someone lose a kid anyway? Lost a kid--huh, come on! And I remember seeing that bus crash into a car on the bridge. But I wasn't paying attention to the time.", "input": "", "output": "Did you just kept on walking for two whole days?"}, {"instruction": "Well, no, not two entire days. I just walked all day Thursday and then slept under the girders on the north side of the bridge Thursday night. Man, it's so fucking cold up there! Then on Friday, I walked back into The City and over into Golden Gate Park and the beach. It was so nice that day. Then there was the woman who lost her dog. I was thinking, \"What's this about?\" Everyone was losing something, including me. By the time I got back Friday night, visiting hours were over. Since I'm not family--by blood at least--they didn't let me in. But the nurse did tell me that he was doing better and was going home the next day.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. I'm still a bit worried, though. Has this kind of thing ever happened to you before? Have you ever spaced out like this before?"}, {"instruction": "Hell, I wasn't spaced out. Jeez, you're making me sound like a drug addict or something. No, I get like this when I need to think. Walking helps me sort things out. I just lose track of time, that's all.", "input": "", "output": "So you were aware of your surroundings the entire time?"}, {"instruction": "Of course! What's wrong with you? Is there something wrong with walking around to process things in my head?", "input": "", "output": "Not in the least. But I think what you experienced was a fugue stage."}, {"instruction": "Huh? A what?", "input": "", "output": "A fugue stage. It can be described very much like what you explained happened to you on your walk--being sort of out of it or spacey, perhaps losing track of time--like sleep walking, you said. Some people describe it as a loss of consciousness while maintaining body functionality. One patient I had called it \"losing time.\""}, {"instruction": "Hmm, I don't know. I guess you can say that I was that. I was fugued-up! Yeah, that's it: fugued-up. I'm a little mother-fugue-er. How's that? That word is too funny. Fugue.", "input": "", "output": "Very funny, Alex. But this can be a very serious condition. This sort of dissociative state can be dangerous. Remember you said that you were lucky not to have been hit by a car.  So please, try to think back. Has this sort of thing happened to you before?"}, {"instruction": "Look. Don't overreact here, okay? It has happened before, but it doesn't really trip me out or anything. It's just something I do. My feet and ankles never hurt that way before, because I usually don't walk around in my motorcycle boots. Satisfied?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Okay, let's talk about what was on your mind while you were out walking."}, {"instruction": "Well, Ralph didn't have the flu after all. He has some kind of intestinal infection or something. It could've come from anywhere. My guess is that it's the sushi he has a propensity for. So they did some stuff to him and gave him some medications that are supposed to get rid of it. He has been feeling a lot better these past few days. But when I was walking, I thought about everything, not just Ralph. I though about Benny--the asshole. And I thought about Luke and how I don't want to lose him, too, but I might anyway. I thought about mom and this new baby thing she's doing. I guess I'm okay with it now. I mean, whatever blows her skirt up, you know? I thought about Tony; he's coming home in another week. Oh yeah, and I thought about the tenant in Ralph's little in-law unit--crazy son-of-a-bitch. I just thought about everything. I keep trying to get myself to a place where my mind feels at ease, at peace, and just okay with things and with me. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. I walked past the gallery and noticed that my illustrations were taken down. They were closed then, so I went back on my second walk on Saturday and saw Jake. You know what he did? He took my work down since no one offered to buy them and put something else up instead. But before I felt myself get upset, I thought I was okay with it. Because if those sold, how would I ever top that at this point. You know?", "input": "", "output": "You have a lot to think about. I hope the walk helped. But you still look tired and very tense. It even shows in your posture, have you noticed? Are you having insomnia?"}, {"instruction": "You know, you really can stir it up, can't you? Yeah, I noticed the tension, how could I not? And yes, I'm still not sleeping. I know you're going to ask, so no--I didn't take any of those damn pills either.", "input": "", "output": "Well, then I guess you also know that I think you need to get some rest. Those \"damn pills\" just might help you do that. How can you expect to be of any help to Ralph while you are like this?"}, {"instruction": "I know, but...", "input": "", "output": "But what?"}, {"instruction": "It's the drug-thing again. I don't want to feel drugged.", "input": "", "output": "The quazepam I prescribed is in a very small dose and shouldn't make you feel drugged. You really must get some rest. I'm not fooling around, Alex. I'm very concerned about you."}, {"instruction": "So don't be. You're probably going to go away, too, you know? Everyone does, eventually.", "input": "", "output": "That's true. Someday I will die. But I hope that day is far far in the future. So while I can't guarantee that I'll be here for you forever, I promise that I plan to be around for a long time. There's no profit in sitting around and worrying about what horrible things the future might bring.  Get out of the future, Alex, and join the present."}, {"instruction": "Just like that?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, just like that."}, {"instruction": "It's just not that easy, because sometimes, it's hard to turn it off, you know? It's hard to stop my mind from running around with thoughts and ideas and stuff. When I wake up with a song stuck in my head, it's not so easy to turn it off.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, from what you have been describing to me today and for the past few sessions, I believe that you might be suffering a mild form of depression."}, {"instruction": "I'm not depressed. That's when you're in a bad mood--crying and shit all the time. That's not me.", "input": "", "output": "But the insomnia is you. The psychomotor agitation is you, and so are the running thoughts. You described these symptoms to me yourself.  And these are some of the symptoms that go along with depression. In your case, the depression is affected by what's going on in your life."}, {"instruction": "But I'm telling you right now, Doctor, I'm not depressed. I'm just preoccupied or something.", "input": "", "output": "Or something? I have a pamphlet here on depression which you might find an interesting start, but a lot of this doesn't apply to you.  Why don't you look up the symptoms of mild depression in the psychology section of your local library? You might find it a very interesting read."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess I can walk over there right now. It isn't a problem, if I walk there from here, is it?", "input": "", "output": "No, Alex, it isn't a problem. I also believe that a good night's sleep might help to decrease the severity of some of your physical symptoms--edginess, tension, tiredness, the need to keep moving. If you are so very strongly against quazepam, then perhaps you should try melatonin.  Melatonin is an ingredient in warm milk that helps one fall asleep. You might have heard a recommendation to drink warm milk before bed? Well, now melatonin is available in any drug store, just over the counter. You might want to pick some up downstairs."}, {"instruction": "Oh, all right. Ralph has been on my case about it, too. And even Katherine asked me if I was okay--she noticed I looked tired.", "input": "", "output": "You talked to her?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. She actually apologized for breezing past me that day, and I had completely forgotten about that. I told her no problem--she hooked me up with Jake, and even though he took my work down, he's got them in his office right now. Plus, I've since met Esther, and now I'm working with Selvin. So Katherine helped to get me on the right path, and I told her how grateful I was to her. Maybe I'll do a painting for her, you know?", "input": "", "output": "That would be very nice, Alex. We're out of time. Try to get some rest, and I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll try. Thanks, man. I appreciate your concern for me, I really do.", "input": "", "output": "I am concerned, Alex. Please take care of yourself. Until next week then? Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. I see you're feeling better this week."}, {"instruction": "I get some rest, but as for \"feeling better\"...", "input": "", "output": "Well, how are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "My legs are better than last time I saw you, but I'm still kind of freaked about Ralph I guess. He's doing so much better now than in the past few weeks, and he's looking much better, too. It's just...it's...uh, I don't know.  I mean I am so over this, you know? And that stuff you wanted me to read up on--about depression? Well, that was something in itself, I'm telling you! Do you realize how much has been written on the subject? The least you could've done was give me a title or two. That would've saved me a lot of trouble, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry you had so much trouble, Alex. What have you discovered?"}, {"instruction": "There's a lot of stuff written about it. That it's considered a chemical imbalance in the brain, and it affects a whole lot of people in this country. I found this book called \"Overcoming Depression\" or something like that. It lists the symptoms of different forms of depression and the treatments. It gets into some detail about the recommended treatments, including medications. The one thing that stuck out for me was the description of a depressed or irritable mood lasting most of the day. Well, I don't usually feel sad, but irritable I definitely feel. Actually, I feel irritable most of the time lately, except last weekend with Luke, but that's another story. I feel irritable, cranky, and just feel not nice mostly. And the psychomotor agitation--that's me, too. But the other things don't fit really.", "input": "", "output": "You failed to mention your insomnia. That's another frequent symptom of depression, too. Now, what other symptoms that you've read about that you don't think fit you?"}, {"instruction": "Insomnia? Yeah, that too. But the thing that struck me most was the description for manic depression. Now I know my mom is manic, that's for sure. And I think back to my...uh, my father. I mean my...no, never mind! You know what I mean. He was too, I think. I'm pretty certain that he was manic. And some of those symptoms fit me, too.", "input": "", "output": "Which ones in particular?"}, {"instruction": "Inflated grandiosity.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Tell me about it."}, {"instruction": "But I've told you about it, maybe you just didn't catch it before. Sometimes when I climb up into the girders under that bridge, I feel like I'm high, like maybe I could fly, if I wanted to. That's somewhat grandiose, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm...okay. Tell me the other symptoms you think fit you."}, {"instruction": "Definitely the need for less sleep--I can go two or three days without even laying down sometimes. And sometimes, it's genuine insomnia, I think. I try going to sleep, but just toss and turn. I guess that's insomnia. Then, I'm easily distracted, and I tend to chatter on sometimes. But the biggest thing is the constant running thoughts that go on and on. Often, I feel like ideas are speeding through my mind so fast that my brain is going to explode. So many ideas that there isn't enough time to even attempt to begin to act upon them. So then, I get paralyzed by my thoughts.", "input": "", "output": "You did your homework, Alex. I'm very impressed. Those are interesting symptoms that we should explore further.  And I do believe that you have some of the classic symptoms of depression. Now, maybe we can talk about treatment. But before we do, I'd like to veer off onto a different but related subject. How have you been sleeping this past week?"}, {"instruction": "I broke down and used the medication that night--the night I saw you. But I didn't need it at all after that. Wednesday night, I took it and went to bed around seven-forty-five, I think. And I slept until around eight the next morning. I didn't feel drugged, and that made me feel better. But I didn't go back to school for the rest of the week. The weird part was--and I wasn't sure if I dreamed it or not, but I think it was real--I woke up sometime that night and found Ralph asleep in the chair that sits facing my bed. It was kind of a blur but there he was, sitting in the chair with a book in his lap, sound asleep.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ask him about it?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but he denied it. I still think I saw him there, though, it's just that it was in a haze. He won't say so, but he is worried more about me than he is about himself--I can tell by the way he's acting. But Thursday night, I went to bed about nine-thirty and slept through until eight again. Anyway, Friday night, I went with Luke down to Carmel for the weekend, and we stayed at his father's house on the beach. Oh, man! It is so beautiful down there. And Luke drives a convertible. I insisted that we drive all the way with the top down. We ended up having the top down, and the heater on most of the way, but it was great. We got a little rained on, too, but that was fun. I slept every night and felt like it was all a dream or something. My sleep, especially in Carmel, was real deep and rejuvenating. I felt so rested when I awoke.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad. And have you been getting plenty of rest since?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess I have. When we were down in Carmel at his dad's house, I didn't want to leave. He has a big old stone house on some bluffs on the shore, and the waves were coming up real high and crashing down real loud. That sort of lulled me to sleep. The rain helped, too. But since we came back, I've been totally on the edge again, and I hate it.", "input": "", "output": "What are you on the edge about?"}, {"instruction": "First, there's Ralph. I don't need to go back into that just now, I think you know what I mean. Then, I have this new and great guy in my life, and I'm so not ready for a relationship, but it seems to be going that way anyway. But while everything is looking so good, Monday night, I noticed this smell of smoke. It seemed to be coming from outside the kitchen, in back by the tenant's door. Ralph has this...this...uh, person who rents the little in-law unit in back by the garage. So I go to investigate, and guess what I found? That idiot was passed out on the floor, and a small fire had started in his garbage can. I had to put it out! It really pissed me off, and then it scared me, too. I'm not willing to be his personal fireman, you know? He's going to burn the whole place down or something. It really worried me. I mean what's next, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What was wrong with him? What made him pass out?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he's only the stupidest person who ever walked the planet, you know? He gets all tanked-up--totally blotto--each and every night. I told Ralph that that's not just the alcohol, it's got to be something else. But I don't want Ralph to get upset right now, he's still trying to get better and now this. The guy is so out of control. He's a damned drunk. And I think he pops pills and then washes them down with the booze. We've got to get rid of him, but Ralph just wants to make nice and keep the guy. But I don't trust him at all. There's just something not right about him, and I'm usually right about these things.", "input": "", "output": "It's a good thing you were there to put out the fire. Alex, you had a lot of stressful events happen to you in the last several months, and as the result you're experiencing sleeping problems. I think it might be a good idea to take a sleeping pill or melotonin before bed--whichever works best for you--all next week.  After you had a whole week of good night sleep, we could assess the state of your other symptoms. How does that sound?"}, {"instruction": "You're the boss, I guess. It makes sense what you're saying. And so far this week, I feel a lot less stress. I attribute that to my nice weekend with Luke. We finally did it, too.", "input": "", "output": "You did?"}, {"instruction": "We did. And it was great! I loved it. Sometimes, I wonder why I waited so long, you know? He's real nice to me. And he's my age, and that's a big plus, you know? He's so good looking, and he seems to have his shit together. He knows what he wants to do with his life and stuff. But...", "input": "", "output": "But what?"}, {"instruction": "But I'm still irritable and cranky most of the time anyway. I worry about when the bottom is going to drop out from under me--I mean as far as Luke is concerned--and I still wake up with a song running on and on in my head.", "input": "", "output": "Well, let's see what this next week of rest will do for you. And take your time with things, allow yourself to feel whatever it is that you're feeling, think things through. Luke seems to be a positive influence on you, too. Alex, try to see the positive things that are happening to you right now."}, {"instruction": "I do try to see the good stuff. There is a lot of it right now, at least where Luke is concerned. And I haven't been fighting with anyone lately either, that's got to count for something. Oh, no! I probably shouldn't have said that. I hope I didn't just jinx myself.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you didn't. And, Alex, I'm proud of you for taking the initiative and doing the research you've done on depression. It should prove invaluable to us both."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. That's just because it makes your job easier, I know.", "input": "", "output": "The more educated and informed you are, the better are the results of the therapy. We're out of time, Alex. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc, how are you doing?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. You seem to be in a good mood today. How are things going?"}, {"instruction": "Things are going good, I guess. I just saw Katherine, and she invited me to go to dinner with her and her brother. I think she said his name was Phillip. He's doing this mural thing over at U.C.S.F., and she's going to take me to meet him and show me his work. She's so cool!", "input": "", "output": "Great."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I can't wait to meet this guy and see his stuff. It always inspires me to check out someone else's work, you know? And then Katherine, well...I'm just so happy that she asked me. After dinner, I'm going to invite them over to the house, and she can see the painting that I'm doing for her. Or maybe she can pick out something else, if she doesn't like the one I started already. There's a lot to choose from.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm glad things are going so well with Kathereine.  I'm like...so happy!", "input": "", "output": "I can see that. How are things going otherwise? Are you getting enough rest?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, actually I am. I've been sleeping pretty much through the night...well, except for the high drama last Thursday night. But other then that night, I've been sleeping.", "input": "", "output": "What happened last Thursday?"}, {"instruction": "Well, remember that guy I told you about--Ralph's tenant, the drunk? He got himself thrown in jail or something. That night--and for the past few weeks really--he's been acting real weird and shit. He's so out of control, you know? Anyway, I guess one of his friends was over. Then the friend must have called the police on him after he left. First, I heard the sound of police radios outside, and then Ralph told me to come over to the window. The backyard was full up with cops, and they had their guns drawn and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and you know what was going on? He had all these guns all loaded up and laid out on the tables. And when the cops knocked on his door, he pointed one of them at the cop. It was like the angry white guy syndrome, you know? So they took him away on...what did they call it? A fifty-one fifty. They took him for a seventy-two hour observation or something. But now, they are keeping him longer because he's nuts. Shit! He's so lucky they didn't shoot him or something, you know? But Ralph...well, he had a fit over the guns. He's evicting the guy now. So we're finally going to be rid of him, and I say, \"Good riddance!\"", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a dangerous person to have right in your backyard."}, {"instruction": "Remember I told you how wrong the dude was? I knew it all along--he was a live wire out of control. But now, he's gone, and that's just fine by me. Oh yeah, and Tony's back. We went up and picked him up last Saturday, Ralph and I. Tony got pissed at his mom and Marney and told them all to go back to France, so they aren't even around right now. They were meddling too much in his shit, you know? But he's home now, and what a mess he has at his house. I guess after they found Tom dead that day, the police or something went into the house and went through their stuff. So Tony has a bit of a mess to deal with.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear he's home. St. Helena is a very good place."}, {"instruction": "Yeah well, he has done okay. It hasn't been easy for him though, and he still has a lot to do--weekly meetings and stuff. But for the most part, he's done pretty well. I'm glad to have him back. Now, Luke's just a little jealous, though.", "input": "", "output": "Why? Tony's just your friend, right?"}, {"instruction": "He is. But he's also older, and he's very good-looking--he's almost as attractive as Luke. Luke just doesn't understand yet, but he will, I know it. I told him that Tony is an old friend--like a brother or something--and that's all, nothing more. He'll understand, eventually. I told him that his jealousy is his own insecurity and that he has nothing to worry about.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he'll get over it. I invited them both for Thanksgiving at my mom's, and they both accepted. By the way, what are you doing for Thanksgiving? Do you want to come over, too? You met my mom before, and I'm sure she would love to have you--in more ways than one! Oh, but she has Mark for that now, doesn't she? Why don't you come?", "input": "", "output": "Thanks for the invitation, Alex, but I already have plans. I appreciate the offer."}, {"instruction": "After all you've done for me, it's the least I can do. But if you have something else lined up...", "input": "", "output": "I do, but thank you for asking."}, {"instruction": "No problem. I baked some bread and made cranberry sauce, all from scratch. I even made some chocolate truffles, too.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds delicious."}, {"instruction": "It will be. Oh shit! I got to call my mom and tell her that I won't be bringing it all over there tonight. I forgot that I told her I would. She gets all worried if everything isn't in front of her face, you know? Maybe she'll come and get the stuff herself.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure it will work out."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it always does, you know? And Aunt Sofie is doing most of the cooking. She hasn't really ever gotten back to normal since being in the hospital, but she insists on doing most of the cooking anyway. It's fine by me, because my mom can't cook as good as Sofie.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like it will be a nice day."}, {"instruction": "As long as mom and I get along, it should be. Oh! You know what Jake did with my paintings? He has them hung up in his office, so that he can look at them from his desk. Isn't that cool?", "input": "", "output": "That's nice, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess he wants them himself. Since all the craziness has subsided, I'm understanding things better. Like I told you last time, if he actually sold them, I don't know how I could ever top that, you know? But Sunday, I went out with Selvin and Esther. We went to some galleries and looked at a lot of different styles of work. And then, the three of us went back to Ester's and did some painting together. It's been real nice working with them. I'm learning a lot.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. Sounds like you're feeling much better. How are the racing thoughts?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I seem to always have that. But this week, they seem to not be so important. They're not running my life, you know? The songs still run in my head though, and that can be real annoying sometimes, particularly when I wake up with one in my head. When that happens, it doesn't go away that easily. If I find that song and play it a couple times on the CD player, then the song goes away. But it only goes away after I've played it a few times. This was driving Ralph crazy, so I had to start doing it with my headphones, only then I would sing along. Ralph says I should be an entertainer--I remember words and inflections of songs real well. He gets a big kick out of it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. It seems like the sleep is doing its job; you don't appear irritable or cranky."}, {"instruction": "I'm not. Not at all. You know, when I feel good, it's hard to describe what it's like to feel bad. And when I feel bad, I can't even remember what it's like to be okay. Does that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it makes perfect sense. Many people feel the same way, Alex. I'm glad to know that you're better, and it really shows."}, {"instruction": "I do feel much better. But...", "input": "", "output": "But what?"}, {"instruction": "Well, this year, Thanksgiving is not on Benny's birthday. Last year, it was. And I've been thinking about it a lot. Last Thanksgiving I spent with Benny and Dora, and we celebrated his birthday as well. When I think about stuff like that, I feel sad.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, uh...I don't know. I think that I really loved him, you know? At least I thought I loved him. He was everything to me: a friend, a brother, a father, and a lover. Kind of sick, huh?", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't..."}, {"instruction": "Well, doesn't sound incestuous?", "input": "", "output": "Why would you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, I think it's sick because I did feel like he was the father I never had, you know? My mentor--I was so stupid.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you were stupid at all, Alex. There's nothing wrong with loving someone. And Benny was your mentor. And--as messed up as things became--you loved him."}, {"instruction": "Yeah? But look what he turned out to be. He lied to me and cheated me. He stole a part of me that can never be reclaimed.", "input": "", "output": "I understand what you mean. It's okay to have these feelings. As conflicting as they are, it's okay."}, {"instruction": "I know, it's just...well, it's like...I don't know. I guess I've been thinking about it these past few days.", "input": "", "output": "It takes a long time to get over an emotional trauma.  I wouldn't be surprised if even years later, thoughts of Benny pop up every now and then."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I wish that the trial would get started, and we can be over that, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand. It would help to get the trial behind you. Do you know when it will start?"}, {"instruction": "From what Cecil told me, as long as Benny is in the mental ward, it may be delayed for months. They say that he isn't fit for trial. It's so fucked! Damn it! How did we get on this subject? I don't want this dragging me down, not when I'm supposed to be going out with Katherine and meeting her brother. Shit!", "input": "", "output": "I can understand your frustration, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Frustration is a understatement! Damn it! Now, we got to stop talking about this for now. Aren't we out of time yet?", "input": "", "output": "Almost."}, {"instruction": "Maybe we should wrap this up now. Katherine is coming back to pick me up, and I don't want her to be waiting for me outside. Do you think I should invite her and her brother for Thanksgiving? And are you sure you don't want to come over, too?", "input": "", "output": "No, Alex, I can't make it. I'm going out of town."}, {"instruction": "It's going to be a good Thanksgiving, I just know it. Now, if I can just get my mind off last Thanksgiving...", "input": "", "output": "Just keep your mind on the moment, on what's happening right now..."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know. Sometimes, it's easier said than done, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I know how it is."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm going to go now.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week. Have a great Thanksgiving with your friends and family, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Thanks and you, too.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "It's that obvious, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I can tell by the look on your face that something has happened. Do you want to tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's a lot. I mean a whole lot. Too much, I guess. Now, don't get all worked up, at least I am sleeping. The melatonin idea you had was a pretty good one. But I guess it's time for me to put another notch in my belt buckle.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Aunt Sofie. First, it was my dad, then my grandmother. Then, Benny and Roly. Now, Aunt Sofie.", "input": "", "output": "What happened to your aunt?"}, {"instruction": "She died. And on Thanksgiving! Can you believe it? We were all having this great Thanksgiving. Even Mom and I were getting along pretty well. Sofie worked her butt off to make that dinner for everyone. Remember? I told you she never really got better since being in the hospital, and then she insisted on doing all the cooking. My mom is such a lazy bitch--she didn't protest enough against Sofie doing it all. But it was all too much for her in the end.", "input": "", "output": "That is awful, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Well, at least she got to eat her last meal with the family, and it was a nice night. Everyone was getting along all right, even Tony and his parents. That's the other part of all this--Tony and his family. But she just looked like she was asleep. No one even bothered her. I don't even know how long she was dead before...I mean, there she was, sitting on the sofa between Racyl and Rhea, and it looked like she had just fallen asleep. You know what the worst part of it was? The last thing I remember her saying to me was that the truffles I made were \"to die for.\" That's the very last thing she said to me. It was too weird. And then mom totally freaked. The doctor has her on bed rest for a couple days.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry about your aunt, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...and then there's the part about Katherine.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine? Did she accept your invitation to Thanksgiving with your family?"}, {"instruction": "No, she didn't. But she missed out on a great dinner, except that the person who did all the cooking kicked the proverbial bucket. But what a strange and small world we live in, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Last Wednesday night after my session with you, I went out to dinner with Katherine and her brother, Philip. We had a real good time, and he was so nice. He's a little disheveled-looking, but he was way cool too, just like Katherine! And his mural at U.C.S.F. is a trip, too. But at dinner, I felt kind of...I don't know. I guess I was sort of like attracted to him, you know? We went to China Court for dinner, and I knocked over the teapot and spilled some of the rice. He made me nervous, in a way. But he wouldn't be interested in me. He was nice to me, though. Anyway, here we were, Katherine and I, going up the steps to Ralph's, when there was my mother going down the stairs with all the Thanksgiving food in her arms. I introduced her to Katherine, and my mom was looking Katherine up and down--giving attitude. I didn't know what was up with that, you know? Well, Katherine didn't seem too phased, but I did notice her distraction when Ralph and I gave her a little tour of his garden. She seemed to like the house though, so I didn't quite catch what the looks were all about until the wake Saturday night.", "input": "", "output": "What happened at the wake?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I spent the whole day on Saturday siting in Ralph's garden. He has this fancy garden in back with this old man--this quiet old Asian man--who comes and tends it every week for him. So I sat out there most of the day, just thinking. Even Ralph came out a few times to check on me since it was raining and I wasn't coming back in. But I didn't mind the rain, I just needed to think again and walking wasn't an option that day, you know? But I forgot what I was supposed to be talking about.", "input": "", "output": "You were telling me about the wake."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah. Anyway, we were all talking a little after, and my mom had obviously got a huge bug up her butt. She was acting jumpy and bitchy--which was normal for her--except that she was like...to the \"nth\" power on bitchy. More family secrets came out, but a bizarre circumstance came up, too. My mom and Katherine work at the same company, which never even crossed my mind. Katherine is some sort of CEO or something, and my mom...well, she's just in charge of the mail room. So it's not like they work together or anything like that. But my mom announced, \"Alex, I want to talk to you in the other room!\" And she said \"in the other room\" like some movie queen or something--so dramatic! And then, she laid it into me about Katherine--\"How did I meet her? What were she and I doing together? What could a woman Katherine's age want from me?\"  It was shit like that. And I was like, \"Why do you care?\" So she told me that she figured out how we met. We had to have met in her office, and she wanted to know what was going on. I was like, \"Mom, you're way off base here. Katherine only helped me to show my artwork.\" But she was ranting and raving about Katherine being too old for me to hang with. I was telling her to chill out, that it shouldn't be such an issue. What was her problem anyway? So later, I got to thinking. What kind of trouble can my nasty mother stir up for Katherine at work? I started to get worried about it. So I was wondering, do you think I should say something to Katherine about this? Or should I just pretend the conversation never happened?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you really believe that your mother would do something to Katherine? What could she really do?"}, {"instruction": "My mom could think of lots of ways to stir up shit, you know? I've told you about her crap.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but do you really believe that she could do anything? Your mother and Katherine might both work for SII, but they don't work together."}, {"instruction": "Right. They probably see each other very little. Thinking back on it, I know Katherine didn't recognize my mom and my mom didn't recognize Katherine at first. But Katherine's face was plastered on SII newsletter because of some promotion she just got, and that was how my mom figured it out. If that newsletter hadn't been circulating so recently, my mom may have just walked right by Katherine. I don't know. Do you think my mom would be so stupid as to start trouble like that?", "input": "", "output": "Well, what do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. With my mom it's hard to tell what she'll be doing next, you know? I think I probably should tell Katherine. Yeah. That's what I'm going to do. It's probably better for her if she was aware of this in case my mom does do something. That way, Katherine can be prepared for it.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds good."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, whatever. If my mom does something like that, it'll all come back to her. And I have a feeling that Katherine won't put up with any shit, you know? Not from someone like my mom--someone so small-time, you know? Actually, she's already getting some of her shit back, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, like I said earlier, more family secrets came out. Oh yeah, and I almost forgot the little trick she pulled on Tony. She got Tony's family to come over for Thanksgiving, but she didn't tell me or Tony that they were coming. And Tony had just told his mom and Marney to go away and leave him alone. It was the last thing he expected. But my mom...well, she had to play her little games with people. So we got there and were having a nice time when the doorbell rung. The door flew open, and there they all were--Tony's family all lined-up with smiles on their faces. It could've really blown up, but Tony was cool about it. He actually went for a walk with his dad, and they had a long talk and cleared the air of some important things. So it worked out okay. But the best part was the latest family secret--Rosemarie. She's my mom's nemesis.", "input": "", "output": "Who is she?"}, {"instruction": "She's Aunt Sofia's long-estranged daughter--the one no one ever spoke of and I knew nothing about. My mom said she was sniffing around for Aunt Sofia's money. But I instantly liked her. I mean, here was this educated woman from New York. She was way more sophisticated and far more attractive than my mom--you could tell they hated each other. You should have seen Luke. He was entranced by all the colorful events in my family's life. His face was priceless, I'm telling you! He was so taken by Rosemarie and my mom--the two bitches at each other's throats. It was the stuff legends are made of. So Rosemarie wanted to be back in the family. But Sofie--bless her heart--wrote her out of the will. There's nothing for Rosemarie. She was the bad seed of the family, and Sofie wrote her off years ago, according to what Mark told me. So here was my mom trying to be the controlling bitch that she can be, and then Rosemarie came along and snubbed my mom like an old cigarette. Man! She was boiling mad! She got what she deserved, though.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'm going to miss my aunt and all, but...but at least she doesn't have to suffer anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  She had a lot of physical discomfort?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that too! But what I meant was that she doesn't have to suffer because of my mother anymore!", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I see. What kind of feelings do you have over her passing? You spoke of sitting in the rain in the garden and thinking."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I did a lot of thinking out there. Things are so temporary. Everything is temporary, you know? I know she didn't mean to leave me, personally. But...", "input": "", "output": "But what?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's just another person I care about who died and left my life. I don't really know how I feel, I guess. It's like I'm numb or something. Does that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "It makes sense, Alex. Most people have a period of time where they feel numb or detached before the gravity of the situation takes hold. It's a normal reaction to the death of a loved one."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, she always treated me well. She talked with me as if I were her equal, never like I was a cheesy kid. She even was beginning to encourage me to pursue my artistic abilities. She was the only one in my family who encouraged me to do anything, and now she's gone. But she did leave me with something. She left me some money on the understanding that the money went toward art school or culinary school, but she stated that culinary school was what she preferred. It's just that...it's just that I don't know if I'll ever be able to make another truffle again.", "input": "", "output": "I can understand that. But perhaps this feeling will change with time. It was nice of her to think of you this way and leave something of value for you. That's going to be a tremendous help to whatever schooling you ultimately decide upon."}, {"instruction": "I know. It's just that now I don't want to make any decisions about school or anything like that. But I'll always remember her for her encouragement.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good, Alex. We've run out of time, I'm afraid. Same time next week, then? And, Alex, if you need me, I'm just a phone call away."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, dude. I know that. Catch you later!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. Sorry I'm late, I had to talk to Katherine for a minute. Shit! My fucking mom is causing trouble for Katherine at work, just as I suspected she would. That bitch! I'm so over this! So over it. Katherine wanted to know if I told her how we met, but I just told her that my mom--as stupid as she usually is--figured it out on her own. She remembered that SII's newsletter--and of course since she's in the mail room, she saw it more than anyone else--Katherine's picture was right on the cover. Well, she just managed to put the two and two together, anyone could've made that same conclusion. But Katherine seemed to think that it was I who told my mom about the therapy! My mom almost stirred up trouble between Katherine and me!", "input": "", "output": "You seem very angry, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Angry? I'm fucking infuriated at her. You know, I almost left here after I talked with Katherine. I was going to go over to the house, but I changed my mind. She's not going to get the fucking best of me over this. I hope she fries. I hope that Katherine burns her big time, you know? She deserves it. Katherine told her boss that we met through our mutual art connections. They don't have to know that Katherine actually made those connections for me after we met. But the most ridiculous part of it was that they thought Katherine might be dating me! Isn't that funny? My mom is such a stupid bitch. Katherine is as old as my mom. Well, maybe not as old, but she's at least ten years older than me. And anyway, she isn't the right gender, you know? I can just picture that! The thing that bugs me is why would my mom want to do something like this? Why does she do such stupid things?", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you decided to stay, Alex. This is a good place to vent your feelings.  It would probably be better if you talk to your mother when you're less agitated.  I'm glad you got a chance to talk to Katherine, though."}, {"instruction": "I wanted to warn her, and then she dropped the bomb on me about what my mom already did. Katherine asked if I could meet her tomorrow to talk about it, but I couldn't let this wait until tomorrow, you know? But I'll tell you one thing, my mom and I are going to have a talk about this. I'm not going to let this just lie, you know? I don't care what is going on between her and Rosemarie, and I don't care if she's pregnant--she'll try to get out of this by using one of those excuses. I just know she will.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, before you confront your mother, are you sure that this is the best thing to do? Such confrontation could make her even more determined to cause trouble for Katherine."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, Man, I don't know. She is going to have to stop this right now! That's what I'm saying. I'm not going to let Katherine suffer. No way!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'm going over there right now!", "input": "", "output": "Alex! Please sit back down. Thank you. Now, take some slow, deep breaths. Okay, good. You're very agitated, Alex.  You need to try to get hold of yourself.  Try to relax a bit."}, {"instruction": "But it's not helping! See? I can't...I...I can't...uh, I don't understand why she's doing this. The other day when we went to get the Christmas tree, Ralph and I talked about the possibilities, and we both thought that she wouldn't do anything like this. What has she got to gain? Nothing. It's like when she meddled with Tony and his family over Thanksgiving. She had nothing to gain there, and then it backfired on her. Now Rosemarie wants Aunt Sofie's things, and my mom isn't letting her into Aunt Sofie's house. What's up with that? She has no right to do any of this, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I agree with you, Alex. But sometimes, we can never understand why people do the things they do. We just have to accept..."}, {"instruction": "Accept it? You're kidding! No way! That's like saying it's okay. If everybody did the kind of shit she does, then we'd all be killing each other. You know?", "input": "", "output": "Accepting people the way they are is not the same as agreeing with their actions. It's just accepting that you can't control people and their actions, just as they can't control your thoughts and opinions of them. Some people do bad things without any logical explanation at all. And sometimes, we don't have the power to stop them. But you can control your own reactions. Will confronting your mother improve this situation? Think this through, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I hadn't thought about it that much, I guess. Anything is possible where Larraine is concerned. I don't know, she has caused enough trouble for me in just these past two weeks to last a lifetime. That bitch! I think she even scared Luke off.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I told you about how she played that little game with Tony and his family. And then there was Rosemarie. My mom has locked her out of Aunt Sofie's house and won't let her get near the place. But Luke...well, he and I were supposed to go out last Saturday night, and he didn't show--didn't call, nothing. The last time I saw him was the day of the funeral, and that was a week and a half ago. He said he had some business in Carmel last week. But we were supposed to meet at Club Universe Saturday night, and he never showed. I called and called...all around, I called, but I haven't been able to reach him. I just know the antics from the weekend before scared him away, and it's mostly my mom's fault--she's such a troublemaker. If Ralph will let me, I may borrow one of his cars and drive down to Carmel to find him so I can figure out what's up with him. If it's my mom...well, I'll tell him she's out of my life. After all this, I don't know what I'm going to do about her. You know?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, is there a possibility that Luke might have other reasons for not getting in touch with you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah...well, I called Beylund, and he told me that Luke has been in the City this week to do some photo work. So it's not like he was called away on business or something. I don't know. Ralph told me that maybe Luke just needs his space for now, but that's no excuse for not calling me. I wanted him to come over and help decorate this huge tree we got. We were going to have a little party last weekend: eggnog, cookies--you know, the whole bit. Ralph and I got this huge, tall tree down in Woodside last weekend. It's twelve feet tall!", "input": "", "output": "Maybe there's a reasonable explanation for Luke's behavior."}, {"instruction": "There better be.", "input": "", "output": "Let's talk a bit about your Aunt Sofie. What has been your reaction to her death?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I keep having these dreams about her--usually, she's hugging me, or she's cooking. But I also had the worst nightmare. She was telling me how my damn truffles were to die for, and when I realized what she said, I woke up in a cold sweat. It scared the hell out of me. I still can't believe that she died on us and on Thanksgiving, too. How am I ever going to be able to enjoy Thanksgiving again? And then there's the truffles. \"To die for,\" that's what she said. \"To die for,\" and then she did. I guess the reality of her death is settling in now, but I still can't believe she's gone. I keep expecting to hear her voice over the phone or to see her walking into the kitchen or something. Even Ralph is pretty broken up about it. I'm going to miss her a lot. She was the only sane person left in my family. And I kind of feel sorry for Rosemarie--my mom is being such a bitch to her. Rosemarie left the family when I was a baby. Now that her mom is dead, she never even got a chance to make up with her, to set things right. And now, my mom is holding a grudge, too. What a fucked-up family I have. But those dreams...well, they're pretty vivid and realistic.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, they don't really bother me...well, not like some dreams I have had. Usually, I feel weird for a little while and then it's over. I miss her, I know I do. Even though I didn't see her every day, I still miss her. I'm glad that she went so peacefully and that she was with us--the people she loved the most--when she died. I guess the reality of it has hit me finally. She was good to me, and I'll miss her for her kindness. Now, if I can just get Rosemarie past my mom.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel it's your responsibility?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? Well, no. It's not, really. But she deserves to at least get inside her mother's house. Maybe that way she can make peace with her or something. Mark told me that she left the family when I was small and that she and Larraine never got along--something to do with her brother, Jeff. He's the one I told you about who died from AIDS-related complications. My mom has no right, no right at all! If Rosemarie is going to remain here in San Francisco, she's going to need a place to stay. And if my mom has anything to say about it, that house is just going to sit there empty. Ralph offered Rosemarie the little cottage in back, after his tenant from hell leaves. By the way, Ralph's tenant--the gunslinger--is back. The police confiscated his guns, but he's still crazy. The day he returned, he was drinking again. Can you believe it?", "input": "", "output": "When is he going to leave?"}, {"instruction": "Ralph gave him an official eviction notice. He has one month to vacate the premises. If he isn't out by the first of the year, then legal eviction proceedings can begin. But he can end up staying there for another three months if he decides to, rent-free even.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "First, you have to serve notice. Then, if the tenant doesn't move--possession is nine-tenths of the law--he can stay for up to ninety days in that place without paying rent while the legal system's rusty old wheels crank away. It isn't any fun being a landlord, and Ralph has put up with it far too long. The guy is a slob and a drunk. I only saw the interior of the place that one time when I put out the garbage can fire, and it smelled something awful and was a total mess. So Ralph and I will have quite a clean up job when he goes. Being a landlord is thankless.", "input": "", "output": "I see. I hope the guy goes without any trouble."}, {"instruction": "That's all we can hope for. But I think he's going to milk the situation for all it's worth. In the meantime, Ralph is a nervous wreck over it, and I am worried that he's going to burn the place down or something. The more I think about it, the more worried I get.", "input": "", "output": "This is something beyond your control, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I know and that's why I'm so worried. The guy is a real weirdo, there's no telling what he may do next. With all this shit coming down, it's a wonder that I'm still sleeping, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you are. Do you still take the melatonin?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, every night now. It really must be working.", "input": "", "output": "What about the running thoughts, do you still have those?"}, {"instruction": "Hello? Haven't I demonstrated that enough for you already? All this shit--my mom causing shit for Katherine--well, that's been on my mind even before Katherine told me what my mom did. And the stuff about Luke is driving me crazy. I wish I knew what was going on with him. Plus now, Rosemarie is here and my mom is playing games with her...well, like I said, I feel bad for her and all. She seems real nice to me. We had her over the house the other night, and she helped decorate the tree. She said that I remind her of herself when she was my age. We really have hit it off. I like her a lot. But I'm worried about what my mother has in store for her. So yes, the thoughts just keep right on running through my head. But they don't keep me up at night. You know what I'm going to do? Instead of going over to my mom's after I leave here, I think I'll go home and wail on that punching bag. Yeah, that's what I'll do. Fuck my mom. Karma will decide her fate. What goes around, comes around--she'll get hers.", "input": "", "output": "I think the punching bag is a better idea, at least for now. But you may still have to face your mom at some point."}, {"instruction": "You mean she's going to have to face me at some point! One way or another, she's going to have to deal with me on this. But the punching bag sounds real good right now. Thanks, Doc, for letting me unload all my shit on you.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to be here for you. And Alex, try to think things through before acting with haste. You will get much better results if you do. And I encourage you to use that punching bag to get these feelings of anger and frustration out. Now, we're out of time."}, {"instruction": "So, I'm out of here, Man. See you!", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week, Alex.  Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Don't ask. Oh, fuck it! Okay, okay. I sort of got into a fight.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "It's my mom.", "input": "", "output": "Your mother gave you that bruise?"}, {"instruction": "No, not her! Shit! It was all about her and Katherine. See, I punched and punched that bag and...", "input": "", "output": "The punching bag, right?"}, {"instruction": "Ha! Ha! You're too funny. Have you ever thought about doing stand-up? Yes, I mean the punching bag. Do you think I would hit my mother? Shit, I wouldn't hit a female; I'd really hurt one if I did. But the punching bag...I punched and wailed and wailed on it, and it still wasn't enough. I couldn't get any of it out of my head, so I started walking around until I found myself at the door. I was putting my key in the hole, and she slammed open the door, scaring the holy-bejesus out of me. And she was like, \"What do you want?\" Well, I told her I knew what she did to Katherine. And then, I tried to warn her that--like the thing with Tony and his parents--it was all going to backfire on her.", "input": "", "output": "What did she say to that?"}, {"instruction": "She started in on me again about Katherine's age. And I was like, \"Hello? I am gay, remember?\" We were both raising our voices, and then Mark got in the middle. And he pushed me back kind of hard, you know? Well, that didn't do anything to help matters, because then I went off big time. I screamed, \"Fuck you\" probably ten times. And the next thing I knew, I was on my ass on the floor--he hit me! Everything was a blur after that. But right now, I am not allowed to go back to the house. Mark has three cracked ribs, and I sort of dislocated his jaw. After all that, I went back to Ralph's and wailed on that bag some more. That's why this hand is bandaged up--I punched for too long with only one glove on and skinned my knuckles. I still feel pretty angry about it--about what that bitch did. She's probably blaming me for everything. Now I'm the bad guy, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Fighting with Mark was not smart, Alex. It wasn't the best way to handle the situation. And you still seem pretty wound up. Have you slept at all?"}, {"instruction": "What's that? Sleep? Me? Ha, ha, ha, ha! You missed your calling, Doc. You should've been a comedian.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not joking, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay. I'll bite. What did you ask me again? Oh, come on! Why are you looking at me that way?", "input": "", "output": "Have you slept at all?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. Sorry. Ha, ha, ha! Oh, uh...sorry, I just kind of feel like I'm losing my mind or something. No. I'm not sleeping. Even the melatonin isn't working, and I don't have anymore of those pills you gave me. But it's okay...ha, ha...uh, I don't need to sleep right now. At least I don't feel like I really need to. Even when I went to Carmel last weekend, I couldn't sleep. So I walked along the beach in front of Luke's family's house. You should've seen the humongous waves crashing on the shore, it was awesome! But I don't feel like I lost any sleep. Funny, huh? Ha, ha!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I will write you another prescription for the sleeping pills. I want you to go downstairs after the session and fill it today. Take it tonight. You've got to get some sleep.  You're not even able to sit still--your whole body is shaking.  And you sound hysterical."}, {"instruction": "But I don't need the medication, I really don't. This will all blow over soon, and then I'll be back to normal. Right now, I just want to run and run--just keep on going, you know?", "input": "", "output": "You've got to get some sleep, Alex. Here's the prescription. Fill it today, okay?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I can fill it...", "input": "", "output": "Then take it tonight, before you go to bed."}, {"instruction": "But...", "input": "", "output": "Alex, why are you trying to argue with me about this? You just told me that you feel like you're losing your mind. Need I say more?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, all right. Sometimes, you take everything so seriously. Luke wonders why I wasn't sleeping. Ralph told me that I can punch the punching bag until I drop for all he cares--he really wants me to get this out of my system.", "input": "", "output": "The punching bag is a good idea if it works. But right now, it doesn't seem to be working. Your lack of sleep is probably the reason it isn't working. There are many studies on sleep deprivation..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, you don't have to go citing some stupid study, okay?  I just do this sometimes.When things get heavy, I don't sleep. I feel a little light-headed, but other than that I don't feel bad. Actually, I feel pretty good right now. And since Luke has reappeared...well, I'm okay there, too. It's just that with him it's...uh, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I told you how he stood me up the weekend before last? And then, when we finally did talk, he told me that he had some family business to attend to. And the night he didn't show, he was working and lost track of time. Beylund was right about him.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he said that he saw Luke during the week--they did some print work--and Luke was obviously preoccupied. But then Luke showed up at the house Friday night full of affection. He couldn't keep his hands off me! He wanted to go to Carmel. So I went with him, and the thing I noticed after going there for the third time was that his family was nowhere to be found. There were pictures and stuff, but no one was home. It's weird.", "input": "", "output": "Where is his family?"}, {"instruction": "Well, his mother died a few years ago, and his dad has some kind of import business and travels a lot. He has a sister who is away in school in Southern California. He also has an older brother who works in the Middle East. But the only time we go there is when his dad is out of town. I haven't met any of his friends or family. Isn't that weird?", "input": "", "output": "You've just explained where they all are. Why does it seem weird to you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he has met everyone in my life except for you. He doesn't like to talk about his family. And when I asked him about friends, he told me that modeling kind of limits his ability to have time for friends. Then I saw pictures of him in his uniform--he played football in high school. There was this one picture of him and this girl in a cheerleader outfit, and they looked pretty chummy. When I asked him about it, he quickly changed the subject. It's like he doesn't want to talk about himself too much. Is that normal?", "input": "", "output": "Some people are very private about their personal lives. I'm sure that with time, as the two of you get to know each other more, he'll open up to you."}, {"instruction": "Well, it surprised me that he just showed up at the house unannounced and totally horny. Here I was in the kitchen making some Christmas cookies, and out of the blue he just walked in and wanted to fool around. I was like: \"Back off, Dude. Can't you see I'm busy?\" He still didn't leave me alone, he was all hands. Finally, I rolled up the cookie dough and put it in the fridge. Then we drove down to Carmel. I don't know, but something isn't quite right with him. It's a gut feeling, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Give it some time, Alex. Perhaps it's nothing. And the lack of sleep can generate paranoid..."}, {"instruction": "Let's not go back there, okay? I know that eventually I need to get some sleep. But right now, I just can't deal with that. My paintings are becoming more elaborate these days. That's what I've been doing--painting. Late at night, when Ralph is asleep, when the world is asleep, I paint. Katherine's painting is almost done. She picked a strange piece; maybe I'll show it to you when it's done. It surprised me that she chose that one. Ha, ha! Yup! She picked a strange one. It's a guy sitting contemplating with a baby elephant in the background trying to get his attention. I just didn't expect her to choose that one. Oh, yeah. When my mom, Mark, and I were fighting, I told her that Katherine wasn't going to take shit from her and that I gave Katherine permission to use anything to beat my mom down. I thought that maybe threatening her would make her back down. I hope she thinks about what I said. I told Katherine that too--she has my permission to do what she needs to do to get my mom off her back. I bet it would really embarrass my mom if people at work knew that I don't even live with her and that we don't even get along. How does it look when a family doesn't get along? Shit! Even Rosemarie is in on the family act, you know?", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she's got herself a lawyer and is contesting Aunt Sofie's will. She wants the house and the trust fund that my uncle set up for her when she was small, before all the trouble between her and Sofie started. I still don't understand everything there. I just don't have all the details. But next week before Christmas, she'll move into Ralph's little unit.", "input": "", "output": "The tenant is gone now?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, he's gone. I guess I forgot to tell you that. Yeah, Ralph offered to give him back his rent money for the month if he would just pack up and go. And the guy took the money and left. So now he's gone. But the day after he left, the police came looking for him. Ralph didn't know where the guy went, but the police insisted that we contact them if we hear from him. The dude did something real bad--my gut feeling tells me that. My gut instinct told me that he was wrong before, and now the police confirmed it. I wonder what he did. Oh, well. After he was gone, we had a big mess to clean up. Ralph hired this guy to clean and paint the place, it should be all ready by the weekend. So my cousin Rosemarie is going to be my neighbor now. Ralph is way cool, you know?", "input": "", "output": "He does seems to like your family, and he is very generous to you."}, {"instruction": "Well, I went out and bought him a couple of real nice cigars, he really loves those. And I'm doing a painting for him for his bedroom or bathroom. It's a guy in overalls standing in a cornfield. The overalls are coming unbuckled, and he wears nothing under the overalls. He's real hot looking--hairy chest and arms, muscular body, and curly blond hair. Ralph doesn't know about it yet, but by Christmas it will be done.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure he will be happy to have one of your paintings."}, {"instruction": "I'll bring some work in soon for you to see.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like that, Alex. I'm glad to know that you're using some of your time productively. We're running out of time, and I'd like to remind you to get that prescription filled on your way out. I'm very concerned about the lack of sleep and I hope that you heed my advice and take the medication. I can't emphasize enough how important your rest is to your well being."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know. Ha, ha, ha! Sometimes, you look so totally serious, you know? I don't know what you'd be like if you had kids of your own. You'd probably be a nervous wreck! But those looks on your face are so...see? You're doing it again! Ha, ha! All right already. I'll get the pills, and maybe I'll get to sleep tonight.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Now, next week is Christmas.  I will only be seeing patients who absolutely need to come in between Christmas and New Years.  Do you want to schedule a session sometime during the next two weeks?  Or do you feel okay to wait and come in on January 7th?"}, {"instruction": "No problem, Doc.  I'll see you in three weeks.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  But call me if you need to, okay?"}, {"instruction": "All right. Later on, Dude.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey! What? What, did I track something in? What?", "input": "", "output": "No, it's your hair...I mean, your face. You look so different."}, {"instruction": "You like it? I didn't think I could do it either, you know? It took about a week to grow it. Pretty cool, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Well, it certainly changed your appearance. It really makes you look much older than you are."}, {"instruction": "I know. A trip, huh? When I went out with Tony, so many people started hitting on me. Tony said he wasn't surprised, but I was so unsure about it. It just sort of happened to work out. I like it. But sometimes, I can't help myself--I stroke my chin like this because it feels so cool.", "input": "", "output": "It looks good, Alex, and you look well. How are things going?"}, {"instruction": "Pretty good, I guess. So much has happened since I saw you last--I don't know where to begin. You heard about my mom, I bet. The hospital and all that?", "input": "", "output": "What happened to your mother? Is the baby okay?"}, {"instruction": "No, not that. Not yet, at least. Well, let me think for a minute. Well, I think it happened the week before Christmas. Yeah, that's right, the week before. Anyway, this is such a trip, I'm telling you. She apparently had this thing with Katherine at work, and I guess she got into some trouble for it--I told her she would. Her boss suspended her or something. Anyway, she's out on disability now and until after the baby comes. At first, I thought she was just doing it all for attention, and I just ignored Mark's calls. But then, he came over to the house, and we sat down and talked for a while. This time we really talked. We connected, somehow. For the first time, I think I saw into him and he saw into me and we understood each other. That was the first surreal thing about all this.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "He told me that my mom was in the hospital. The baby was all right, but she wasn't. I guess that this pregnancy sort of reminded her about when she was pregnant with me, and she started freaking out, doing all this totally crazy shit. You already know what I'm talking about. Then the thing with Aunt Sofie happened. Well, it all added up for her, and she started having these major panic attacks. One thing led to another, and there she was in the psycho ward. I thought you knew all this already. Aren't you her doctor?", "input": "", "output": "No, Alex. Is she going to be okay?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she's still going to the hospital--if that's what you want to know--but she's not sleeping there anymore.", "input": "", "output": "You surprise me, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Why?", "input": "", "output": "Well, the way you were talking about her last time as compared to now...you seem sympathetic."}, {"instruction": "Well, that's the funny part of this. I knew she was faking, I just knew. I even told Mark that. But then he told me the reason she was so twisted up about Katherine and me. With all this maternal stuff building up inside her--with the baby and all--she was jealous! Can you believe that? She was threatened by Katherine. Her maternal whatever was freaking out over me spending time with this woman. I still had trouble believing all this. And then I agreed to go see her, because he said she was asking for me. Well, she surprised the hell out of me.", "input": "", "output": "How was she when you saw her?"}, {"instruction": "She looked worse than hell. I never saw her looking so bad. And the funny thing was when we talked she was like...she was...uh, I don't know. She was just real for once. She made sense to me. She told me how it was to be pregnant and have the father run out on you. It was the time she needed him the most. My grandparents were so fucked up, and she felt she needed him then. She needed his strength. In case you haven't noticed, my mom's not a big woman. She has physical limitations because of her size--they have to take some extra precautions while she is pregnant. But there she was alone, sort of, and not too self-assured. She had little self-esteem, and my grandparents got in on the act with her. She learned from the best, you know? But anyway, all this stuff she told me I believed. Some things I had wanted to hear from her myself, and others I really didn't need to know. But she apologized to me. Apologized! I couldn't believe it even when she was right in front of me...she apologized. And I told her I accepted it...for now at least. It looks like she's trying to change her life. Uh, I don't know. Just between you and me, I keep wondering if this is the end of the world or something. I'm like trying to wake up from this dream, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. This is a fascinating turn of events for you, Alex. And you look different, too. It's not just the goatee, either. You really look relaxed. Do you believe she is going to make an honest effort with you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, if she doesn't this time, then she's just fucking herself up even more.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...well, I really think things are going to change between my mother and me. I just have that gut feeling, you know? I've been getting a lot of these gut feelings lately. I guess time will prove what her motives truly are. But the thing is this: I connected with Mark this time, too! It's funny, but I see myself in his eyes, in his face. I look a lot like him. But I just somehow...some way understood. He and I finally understood each other. Things are going to be cool from now on.", "input": "", "output": "This is very good, Alex. Reconciliation with your family is a very positive step..."}, {"instruction": "You're always so serious. Can't you just be happy or something?", "input": "", "output": "I am, Alex. I just want you to recognize that developing these relationships will be a lot of work and not just on your part. Everyone will need to make adjustments. How are you with all this, Alex?"}, {"instruction": "I'm good. Skeptical, but not too much. Dubious. I'm kind of going to take a wait and see attitude. I'm not running back to her house and moving in just yet. I may never live there again. But who really knows? Right now, I feel good about things. Things are going okay with Luke, I guess. And Tony and I have been having a lot of fun lately. Plus, I went out with Katherine and Philip--he's so cute--to a holiday celebration at the Range Gallery. It was so cool! Some famous local people were there. And there was this rumor going around that Ron Wood of The Rolling Stones was going to be there, but he never showed up. But you should have seen all these groupie chicks hanging around with disappointed looks on their faces!", "input": "", "output": "Why did they think he would show?"}, {"instruction": "Well, because Range handles his paintings. It's not really a big secret or anything, and he's pretty good, too. Since Mick Jagger was spotted a few days before in The City, they just assumed that Ron Wood would be here too, I guess. I don't know, but the party was fun. And Jake told me that someone showed interest in one of my paintings, but it wasn't a specific offer or anything. He still has them on his office wall.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm not holding my breath or anything. We'll see. Katherine surprised me with a little gift.", "input": "", "output": "Really? What did she give you?"}, {"instruction": "A tape. See, at the party I kind of gave her a bad time about being a number-cruncher--she just tweaks the books, moving numbers from here to there. Then we got into a discussion with Philip about how numbers permeate everything. I'm a number. You're a number. Money. Even rock bands. She made a tape for me, and all the band names and the song titles have a number in them. She handed it to me. And when I opened it, she said something like: \"See, I'm not all about numbers. I like music, too!\" It had songs like \"One Headlight\" and groups like Third Eye Blind and Matchbox 20. It was a trip! And the tape is pretty cool stuff, too. It took me a minute to realize that she did a number on me--no pun intended! She really turned the tables, you know? We got a big laugh out of that. And her brother...well, he's something else. He said such funny things and so cute, too. Even some of the groupie girls were hanging onto every word he said. I'll bet he could've gotten laid if he wanted to. Who knows? Maybe he did!", "input": "", "output": "Well, it sounds like the party and the holidays have been good for you."}, {"instruction": "You know, I was talking about this very thing with Luke the other night on the way back from Carmel. I met his sister, by the way. But he and I were assessing our holidays, and we both had pretty nice holidays this year. How about you? How were your holidays?", "input": "", "output": "Mine? Oh, just fine. Thanks for asking. So you met Luke's sister?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I went down there with Luke for New Year's, and they had a party at his house. Beylund came down and was firing off his camera everywhere, and some of the people from the agency--you know models and stuff, pretty people--they were all there. It was a veritable fashion show if ever there was one. His sister is absolutely stunning! She could be a super model, if she wanted to be. And she's so nice, so down to Earth just like Luke. She and I had a long talk. We went running on the beach early in the morning and talked about Luke. I didn't realize it before, but he is very closeted. He likes to keep up his butch persona. And it fits him, too. But she knows he's gay, and she also knows he wants to keep it down. Apparently, their dad isn't aware of it, and they don't think he would handle it too well. Now the only thing left is that girl in the picture.", "input": "", "output": "What girl? What picture?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if I mentioned this to you. Luke graduated from high school early so he could go into modeling more seriously. Before he left school, he was into all the sports--baseball, football, and all that. He played on the football team, and there's this picture of him in his uniform and this girl--this cheerleader--looking real chummy. It couldn't have been taken more than even a year ago.", "input": "", "output": "What bothers you about it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it did sort of bother me at first, but now I'm just real curious. When I asked his sister about the girl in the picture--the same girl that popped up in several other pictures as well--she just changed the subject. Without even blinking, she changed the subject. I asked her again, and she told me that the girl was just a friend of the family. Even Luke didn't want to talk about her. They acted all...I don't know, so disinterested. Too disinterested. And then they wouldn't say anymore. It's another one of those gut-feeling things, you know?", "input": "", "output": "It's good to heed those feelings sometimes. Who do you think she is?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. An ex-girlfriend, I guess. It must be, and I bet she broke his heart or something. They both acted almost ominous about it. It was pretty weird. And another weird thing happened. Actually, this was just the night before last. I was asleep in my bed and I heard something and woke up. Well, at least I thought I was awake. I looked up because I heard someone in my room, and when I looked up, I saw Benny. He was standing right over the bed and he was crying, telling me how sorry he was and how much he wants me to forgive him. The next thing I knew, I was awake, the room was empty, and the morning light was just starting to touch things in my room, making everything all glimmer. My window was open, and I looked out and down the trellis thing there and thought for a while. Why would Benny be visiting me in my dreams so vividly? Why now? That gut thing again tells me I'm going to be hearing something about him. But there's nothing yet. Wow! It really stuck with me--this dream--and it was so real. My heart nearly stopped there for a moment. But the most bizarre part of it was that my window was open. And you know how cold it's been here lately--I don't open the window at night.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe Ralph opened it?"}, {"instruction": "He said he didn't. I don't know, I must have had it opened and then didn't lock it right. It's one of those swing out kind. Maybe the wind pulled it open, I don't know. But it was weird timing, with the Benny dream and all.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. Well, Alex, I'm afraid we're just about out of time. I'm going away for a vacation during the next two weeks, so let's schedule the next appointment for January 28th at five p.m. There will be a doctor on call in case any emergencies come up.  And you can still reach me by phone in a crisis."}, {"instruction": "Gee, Doctor, you sure take a lot of vacations: two weeks off, one week on, and then two more weeks off. I wish school worked that way! Well, Happy New Year, Doc! See you in a couple of weeks!", "input": "", "output": "Okay, then. Take care, Alex."}, {"instruction": "It happened again, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's hard to explain everything, but I'll try and see if I can get through the whole story. Remember I told you about that dream I had about Benny? In a dream, he would be standing there in my bedroom. And then when I'd wake up, the window would be open.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I remember."}, {"instruction": "I think it was an omen or something, you know?", "input": "", "output": "How was it an omen?"}, {"instruction": "Well, see...I don't know. It's just that...that I can't...shit! I can't believe it still, I just can't believe it.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me what happened, Alex."}, {"instruction": "It's Roly. He's dead.", "input": "", "output": "Oh no! How did he die?"}, {"instruction": "See, a couple more times I found my bedroom window open and there was no explanation for it. I kept on thinking it was the wind or something. Then on my birthday, a couple of Saturdays ago, after Tony and I got back from LazerStorm with Katherine and Jake, we had a party. I cooked dinner. Ralph was there of course and so was Tony. But Katherine and Jake had spent the afternoon with Tony and me, so they were kind of tired out and went home. That was what Katherine did for me for my birthday--she took Tony and me to play LazerStorm. It was a blast! I'd never gone before, but I think I'll go back. Have you ever done it?", "input": "", "output": "No, I haven't."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's a laser-tag game with teams. You have to have four people, and you usually hook up with some other people there, and then you just aim and fire. It's way cool. And Katherine...well, I never suspected she'd be interested in doing stuff like that, you know? She's just a big kid underneath all that business-like cover she uses. But Jake...now he's something else. He seems to take it all so seriously. You know, I don't think he ever really smiles. Anyway, what was I talking about? I got all sidetracked I think.", "input": "", "output": "You were going to tell me the circumstances surrounding Roly's death."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. Shit! I can't really explain it, but since he died, I've had the worst nightmares. Suddenly, I'm all tensed up again, but only this time, the tension is different I think.", "input": "", "output": "In what way is it different?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it just is. I just can feel it differently. I'm not feeling like walking or anything. I can't paint or even draw right now. And then there's Luke. I don't seem to really want him touching me right now. I feel kind of dirty or something. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Did you see Roly before he died?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes and no. See, that night--the night of my little party at the house--Ralph and I had Tony and Luke over. And Selvin came, too. We had a boys' night at the house. Then my cousin Rosemarie came running up the steps to the kitchen, all freaked or something. She said she saw someone climbing the trellis below my bedroom window. When I went into my room, I saw him. But he was on his way down and had almost reached the ground by then. He ran away! I don't know why he took off like that, but he did. I realized he needed to talk to me. I guess since he's been living out on the street, he didn't really want anyone else to see him that way. And he looked like a mess, too. But he just ran away, like a frightened animal or something.", "input": "", "output": "So Roly was the one who kept opening your window?"}, {"instruction": "It had to be him, it wasn't Benny. Benny's still in the jail's hospital or something, so I knew it wasn't him. Who else could it have been? But I didn't hear from Roly again after that. Did you hear about that guy who jumped in front of a BART train a couple weeks ago?", "input": "", "output": "No, I was on vacation and haven't heard about it. Was it Roly?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. He killed himself, threw himself in the path of a BART train near the Trans-Bay tube. Stopped the system for a couple hours while they scraped him off the electric third rail. He fucking killed himself, Doctor. I...I just can't believe he did it.", "input": "", "output": "How did you find out about it?"}, {"instruction": "His mother came over to my mom's house looking for me, and she told the whole story to my mom. My mom, trying to change her life, was surprisingly all comforting to Roly's mom. She even invited her to stay at the house. She called me to come over, and when I went there, they told me. He didn't leave her a note, but he left a note for me. I found the note in my bedroom the day after they told me. And ever since, I've been having these bizarre and scary dreams.", "input": "", "output": "What are the dreams about, do you remember?"}, {"instruction": "I was afraid you were going to ask me that. They're about Benny and...and...well, that guy before. You know, the one Benny saved me from? I don't want anyone to touch me. I feel disgusting and all and...I don't know, all ruined or something.", "input": "", "output": "Are you dreaming about real events?"}, {"instruction": "Well, sort of. I'm dreaming more about the guy before. His name was Joe. It's like I'm replaying all the times he...he...uh, all the times he...", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. I think I understand what you mean. You and I haven't really talked all that much about this. You said, \"All the times.\" How long did it go on for?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I don't want to really talk too much about this, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Well sure, Alex. We can put this on the back burner for now. But I think it will do you good to get it out and talk about these feelings."}, {"instruction": "But I just don't want to keep on reliving it all over again, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand how you feel. But don't you think that, through these dreams, you are reliving it already?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah...uh, but...I don't know! Goddammit, man, this really sucks, you know? Here I have this great guy who is good to me and knows how to make me feel good, but suddenly I don't want him that way anymore. Or maybe it's true just for right now, I just don't know. I'm so confused, and I can't stop thinking about what Joe did to me. But you know with Roly...well, that Benny's fault. That mother-fucker!", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned that Roly left you a note. What did it say?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he couldn't live with himself anymore. That this whole thing with Benny won't go out of his head. He felt like he was slipping into oblivion and couldn't figure out how to get out of the black-hole thing he was in. He said that he was totally lost and was afraid of the entire world. Everything scared him. He said he couldn't see going on like this. He was sorry for what he did to me--he never intended for Benny to screw me up, too.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I never really thought about it, you know? I just can't believe he didn't try harder to talk to me about this. He knew he could always talk to me when he was down. He knew his secrets were always safe with me. But he said in the letter that he was setting himself free. And the hardest part is that if I had found that letter sooner, I may have been able to go out and find him--to do something to stop him or figure out a way to help him or something like that, you know? It's so fucked that he did this to me and his mom. Benny is going to suffer for a long time for all this. The things Roly said got me to thinking about my own situation and how fucked-over we both were, not to mention anyone else he screwed with.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Benny did a lot of damage."}, {"instruction": "But now, I'm feeling like my skin is all itchy and stuff, like I want to get out of my skin or something. I don't know. I just feel like I can't get myself clean, and the thought of any sex makes me nauseated--like I want to puke. I'm supposed to be enjoying things like that, like most kids do. And here I haven't even been able to be a kid for a long time. When I lived with my mother, I had to pretty much take care of myself. And then there was all that time fooling around with people on the streets and turning tricks for money. And those fucking tapes! My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. Ugh! I just feel like my skin is crawling, and it's bugging the hell out of me.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex, you are here with me in a safe place. Take some slow breaths and try to relax yourself. Stretch out a little, you look so uncomfortable with your knees all crunched up to your chest that way."}, {"instruction": "But see? That's what I'm trying to tell you--I can't get comfortable. If I try to sit like a normal person with my legs out and feet on the floor, I feel like I'm unprotected or something. And on the train going down to school, I get real nervous when someone is sitting behind me. So I go and sit way in the back of the train with no one behind me. Plus there's my hair. The reason I shaved my goatee and cut it all off so short was because I felt like my scalp was going to burst--like I was infested with bugs or something.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, what's that mark on your neck?"}, {"instruction": "I've been scratching. But the weird part is that my throat--see, right along here--feels so sensitive to anything that touches it, that I got this rash thing.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know why it's so sensitive all of a sudden?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, has anyone ever held a knife to your throat?", "input": "", "output": "No, has that ever happened to you?"}, {"instruction": "That's what Joe did to me. He held a knife to my throat while he...uh, while he...um, while he fucking raped me, okay? So that's what he did.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Do you? Do you really see, Doctor? I can't explain it any other way. That's just what he did to me. I can't describe how that feels...the cold sharp blade pressed against my throat while he burned me from the inside out...", "input": "", "output": "Burned?"}, {"instruction": "No, no, that's just what it felt like, like a burning red-hot poker up inside me. But it didn't always feel that way, and he didn't always have to hold a knife to my throat, either.", "input": "", "output": "So he stopped using the knife at some point?"}, {"instruction": "I bet you want to know why he stopped. It's because I gave in to him and didn't fight him anymore. Because I think I actually sort of liked...no, no, no! I didn't like it! Fuck! It's not supposed to be happening to me right now! Everything was going so well here with my mom and with Luke. Why does this have to keep coming up? I feel...I feel like it was yesterday, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, it's normal..."}, {"instruction": "It's not normal! Doctor, I feel guilty. I wasn't supposed to like it! That's sick. I was just a little kid. I shouldn't have liked something like that. I wasn't even supposed to be aware of such things!", "input": "", "output": "It isn't sick, Alex. It's the way you felt about it. There isn't anything wrong with feeling the way you do. You had no control over the situation, over your person. This person overpowered you."}, {"instruction": "No kidding.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I'm going to loan you a book. I want you to take it home and look through it. It wasn't written for men, really, but it has a lot of material relevant to what you've been through and you may find it very helpful. It's called \"The Courage to Heal.\" Here."}, {"instruction": "It's a big book, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "It talks about sexual molestation and gives suggestions on ways of dealing with the emotional aftermath. You were introduced to sex at a very early age, and that damage is quite serious. This book is very well written, and I think it will help you tremendously."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll look through it.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I'm afraid we've run out of time for today. I'll see you next week, but if there is anything that you need between now and then, please don't hesitate to call me. And, Alex, try not to beat yourself up over the way you feel. Feelings aren't right or wrong, they are simply the way you feel. Sometimes, they are good feelings and sometimes bad. But they are never wrong. Understand?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. Well, see you later, Doctor Balis. Thanks for trying to help me.", "input": "", "output": "Anytime, Alex. That's what I'm here for. Goodbye, Alex. Take care, and I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "You can save the bull shit nicey-nice stuff, Doc. Oh, and here's your damn book back! I don't need that shit. What? Why are you looking at me that way? Shit! Okay, okay, sorry. But...", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you're really upset. What is it? Is it the book? What bothers you about it?"}, {"instruction": "I told you before, I don't want to talk about this! Jeez!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. It seems like the book brought up a strong emotional reaction..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well. That book is for someone who didn't deserve what they got.", "input": "", "output": "Do you believe that you deserved having a knife held to your throat?"}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't say that! Shit! Not exactly. I said that it was...it just was something that I did. It was something that sort of happened to me. It's just...it's...well, the people in that book are unable to live their lives or something. I can still do things. I go to school and stuff and...now what?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you were too young to know better, you were too young to understand the consequences of what was happening to you. But you were physically, sexually, and psychologically abused.  What happened to you would be difficult even for an adult to cope with--you were just a child."}, {"instruction": "It's...sometimes, it's so much for me to think about, you know? My throat is still hypersensitive. I still have this rash thing, see? Even the other day, when Luke and I told each other our little secrets, I couldn't tell him about this, you know? I couldn't bring myself to say anything. It's like it's too private, too personal. I don't know. And forget about touching my neck--when he even came near it, I cringed. I just...it's just that...I don't know. I just don't know.", "input": "", "output": "The box of tissue is right here, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I'm such a little pussy, you know? I should be able to just get over it. You know, last week after I left here, everywhere I looked I saw people who looked like him, like Joe. And some of them looked like Benny, but mostly like Joe. And I could see so clearly. I saw everything, everyone, and what it all meant to me. It was like I was hyper-aware of everything, anything. I think that's why all of a sudden over the past few weeks I didn't want to have sex. I went home that day, and ever since I worked out circuit training, rode my bike all over, in the rain even. And a couple of days after riding, I've come home to do the punching bag. And Ralph started to tease me about the kitchen and about my bedroom.", "input": "", "output": "Why? Are they messy?"}, {"instruction": "No, not at all. Not ever! But I must have reorganized this one section of the kitchen cabinets like ten times in the past two weeks, and I didn't even think twice about it until Ralph said something. Then I started thinking about it, and--for like at least maybe eight nights or so--I've waken up and went into Ralph's room just to make sure he was still there, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I see. Alex, how is your sleep? Are you staying up, pulling all-nighters again?"}, {"instruction": "No, I've been sleeping regularly, except for the times I woke up and checked on Ralph. But after I do, I just go back to bed and fall right back to sleep. Oh, yeah. I have this. This is a letter I wrote to Benny. I even sent it, too.", "input": "", "output": "A letter? What did you say?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I kept it to one page, but I think I said a lot. Do you want to hear it? It isn't very long, really.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to hear it."}, {"instruction": "Okay, it starts like this...well, I'll just kind of read bits of it,okay? Here it goes: \"Benny, now that Roly is gone--he killed himself over what you did to him. He jumped in front of a BART train. Well, now that he's gone, I decided that I wasn't going to let myself go the same way. And now I think I understand why you left the way you did, the way you disassociated yourself from me. You knew. You knew it was coming--this thing with that kid. You somehow knew you were going to get popped, and you didn't want me involved. It's the same reason you ransacked my mother's house. Were you somehow trying to protect me? Dora told me about the tape. I saw the evidence, but I didn't turn it over. It was wrong to tape me, to tape us, you and me. It was so wrong when it could have been right. But you had to go and find another younger one. First, Roly. Then, me. And then, that kid. It wasn't me at all, was it? It was youth that mattered to you, it wasn't the person you were with. And I understand everything now. So I write to tell you this--I understand. I'm not saying this to make you think I would do anything to help you, but I'm not going to testify against you in court. I won't help them put you away.  But it's not for you that I'm doing this, so don't get it wrong.  It's for me. I just don't want to live the rest of my life hating you for what you did. So I'll do it for me. And I forgive you. Goodbye and good luck. Alex.\"", "input": "", "output": "That must have been a very hard letter to write, Alex. I'm proud of you for expressing your feeling this way. There is an exercise in this book that includes writing a letter to the person who perpetrated the abuse. Maybe you should keep the book for awhile. How did it feel to write this letter?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't realize that it was an exercise. Let me see. Hmm. It is, isn't it? It's right here, \"Letters to the abuser.\" Hmm. I really didn't notice that before.", "input": "", "output": "So you sent the letter already?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I did.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's an important step, Alex. You said that you do not wish to testify against Benny.  You should do what feels right to you right now.  But be aware that your feeling on this matter may change. You mentioned that you and Luke were exchanging secrets. What did you share with each other?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he told me about Heather. She's the one in the pictures. Heather was his \"coming-out\" girlfriend. I talked about Benny, the real stuff--the tricks and the videos and stuff. But the thing about Joe...well, I didn't say anything about that. You know, besides Benny, you're the only other person I told about that.", "input": "", "output": "I think it's good to be able to talk about all this with people that you care about and that care about you. Ralph, Tony, and maybe even your...uh, Mark."}, {"instruction": "It's okay, you can say it. Mark is my father, no big deal. Hmm, I know that they're there for me, but...well, I don't know. There's Katherine, too. She called last week and said that she was concerned about me--my short cropped hair and just how I looked all out of sorts. She was worried. I really like her a lot. When I saw her today, she suggested that we do something this week.", "input": "", "output": "It's just important, Alex, to realize that you have a nice circle of friends, and they can offer you their support. And I encourage you to accept it. It will make a difference. I know how independent you can be, but opening up and letting people in can be an important part of healing. And you have my support, of course. This is some serious stuff we are dealing with here, Alex. I'm proud of you for talking about it. I know how hard it is to do that, and you should be proud of your work here, too. The letter is a great step in itself."}, {"instruction": "Well, somehow, I don't think I can bring myself to feel proud about it. I'm kind of ashamed of myself, maybe even a little humiliated or something. It's all fucked, you know? Sometimes, I think that I saw it all on TV or something. I feel like it really isn't real. But it did feel good to talk to Luke. It was like a huge weight had been lifted, and I know that he felt the same. You should see how guilty he feels over that girl, Heather. He told me that he was dating her--as I suspected--and at the time he already knew that he was gay, but he didn't want to admit it, to come out to anyone. But his sister knew, and she kept trying to get him to accept it and admit it. Well, the day he finally told Heather, she was driving in a car with him. She got so upset that she stopped the car and threw Luke out and then drove off. Later, she got into a really bad accident. Down in Carmel, there're all these sharp twists and turns and cliffs and ravines and stuff. Well, she drove herself into a wreck and fucked herself up--hit her head and got brain damage. Now, she lives in a nursing care place, and Luke blames himself for it. That is the real reason he graduated early from high school. As for my story, after I told him all about Benny, it sort of meant less to me. It was like Benny didn't matter that much anymore, or maybe more like I came to a different understanding about it, a different feeling. I realized how important it was for me to not be a part of that...that trial thing, and to try to let it go so I could let him go. He's going to get everything he deserves anyway. Plus, Luke didn't seem to judge me or anything. He just listened, and then he put his hand on my shoulder and looked me in the eyes and told me that it didn't matter to him. It didn't matter to him what I had done in the past. That helped me feel better about some of it.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that Luke is being supportive. I want to continue to urge you to look through this book some more. Why don't you try out some of the other exercises?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. And I told Luke that his secret past with Heather didn't change anything between us. We had sex, but my heart was still not into it. He noticed that, too. I felt kind of distant or something, I don't know. I think I love him and want to be with him, but my heart isn't in it like it was. Do you think I'm crazy?", "input": "", "output": "No, not in the least. I think that at your age, and with all that you're dealing with now, it's hard to be in love. It doesn't surprise me that sex is uninteresting to you currently. It may feel this way for a while. Most people who are sexually abused have similar reactions. Some become withdrawn, like you, while others become overly sexual. It can be difficult to assess the damage that was caused. It's important to realize that there isn't any one specific answer and that your reaction will change over time."}, {"instruction": "So the reason I'm so scared about all this is that it's deeper than I want to realize. Does that make any sense?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Being confused is the one thing you can be certain of. Dealing with sexual abuse is very overwhelming. So try to be kind to yourself."}, {"instruction": "See? This is why I didn't want to go into all this. It's too...it's so...I don't know. It's the one thing I don't have control over. And all these thoughts in my mind are just overwhelming. That's why I try not to think too much about it. But when I try not to think about it, I find myself thinking about it even more. I'm afraid that if I let the thoughts go on, I'll lose control or something. I don't know. I think I'm having a hard time putting all this into words. Do I make any sense?", "input": "", "output": "You do. As I said to you before, any feelings you have are okay to have, as conflicting as they may be. Allow yourself to feel what you feel, and if it becomes too much for you, I'm a phone call away. I want to encourage you to continue to write your feelings down--you seem to have a knack for that. And try to accept the support of your friends and loved ones. Try not to shut yourself away from them."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I guess we're running out of time. Gee, time sure flies in here sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "It does, doesn't it? Okay, then. Good work, Alex. I'll see you the same time next week. And remember to call if you need to. I'm here to help."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, dude. See ya!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, here. Don't forget the book."}, {"instruction": "Aw, shit! I guess I was trying to forget about that.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, I understand."}, {"instruction": "All right, man, talk to you later.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex, and take care of yourself."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. You don't have to say it--I know, I know. It's just the way it grows when I don't shave. Tony said I look like a skin-head or something. Ralph thinks it makes me look Middle-Eastern.", "input": "", "output": "You have made a lot of significant changes in your appearance lately, Alex. The goatee looks good. How are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Okay, I guess. You were right about Katherine.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I met her last Saturday over at Pasqua's on Eighteenth Street. She's a good friend, you know? We had some hot chocolate and watched the rain come sheeting down and all the lightning...did you see it? Wow! We hardly ever have storms like that! But Katherine is just cool, that's all I can say. I really like her, she's so smart but not snooty about it. It's like she's naturally cool, I don't know. First, we were both excited that Jake sold my paintings.", "input": "", "output": "He did? That's wonderful news, Alex. Congratulations!"}, {"instruction": "Thanks, man. Yeah, it was so out of the blue, you know? Jake had left a couple messages for me with Ralph. And then when I called him, he said he needed to see me. So I thought that he was going to give me back my paintings--he is always so serious about stuff. But when I got there, he handed me an envelope, kind of smiled--I don't think I ever saw him do that before--and just stood there waiting for my reaction. Well, when I opened up the envelope and saw the check, he said, \"I think the price was more than fair.\" And I was like, \"This is so cool.\" But you know anything would have been great. It was not a lot of money, but it's a start. He said the person who bought my paintings wanted to remain anonymous but also wanted to see more of my work. I was thinking it was all a joke--Jake was just standing there with his arms folded across his chest and that big smile on his face--but he was serious. Now, I'm wondering who it was that bought it. Was it you?", "input": "", "output": "No, Alex, it wasn't me. What made you think that it was me?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I just thought that maybe you were trying to make me feel better--you know, with all the shit I've been telling you lately. I just don't know who it could be. But I wish I knew, though.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "Why do you want to know who it is?"}, {"instruction": "Well...uh, I don't know. I just do, I guess. It's just so not real, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I can imagine it feels like a surprise."}, {"instruction": "Well, it was, and Katherine was overjoyed about it. She was all affectionate. It was like she was lit up inside over my little success. I have never had someone act like that over anything I did. She was so enthusiastic. When I told her that Jake smiled, I was sort of making an observation. But she got this funny look on her face--like she was trying to imagine that or something. I noticed that right away. But she and I had a nice long talk. I told her about Benny and Roly.", "input": "", "output": "What about Joe? Did you tell her about him?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm, no. Why? Why do you want me to tell people about him so bad?", "input": "", "output": "That's not it, Alex. I want for you to accept support, the support you need from others. It will help in the healing process."}, {"instruction": "Well, it did feel good spending the day with Katherine. She listened to the entire story of Benny and didn't act like she judged me or anything. She just seemed like she had this deep intense understanding and...I don't know, respect I guess. Now, she kind of understands why I live with Ralph--I told her about that story, too. And I told her about my mom.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that you were able to open up so much to Katherine.  I do think that can be very beneficial."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, there's been a lot of stuff happening lately--things that I never thought I'd do or see. I saw this man the other day, he reminded me of myself except he was a lot older--your age maybe--and he was ranting and raving and carrying on and pounding his fist on the counter of the pharmacy at the medical center. I don't want to grow up to be like that--at odds with everybody, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand that, and this is why we are working together. Why were you at the pharmacy?"}, {"instruction": "Well, see, that's one of the things I thought I'd never do. Mark was away on a business trip, and my mom is having more trouble with being pregnant. She needed to go to the doctor again, so I took her. They did one of those things with the picture--an ultrasound, I think--and I saw the baby. We were able to see everything. It was weird! I could see it's fingers and toes, and it was all curled up but moving around and stuff. And then I got to thinking that it was me in there before. And then I got grossed-out and stuff; yuck, it's all gross in there or something. It's no wonder I was born six weeks early. I probably couldn't take it any more, you know? But it was so small. They said it was another boy, like me. So I wonder what life will be like for him? Will he have a better chance than me? Will he be like me? Will I like him? Will he like me? It's kind of weird to think about this stuff. But most of all, I wonder if he will be safe.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But my mom is a trip, you know? She can be so nice one minute and the next be a total raving bitch. She's psycho! There we were waiting in the pharmacy, and we were talking about her computer problems. I asked her some questions--you know, \"Did she call technical support?\" things like that--and she just turned on me for a split second. She just turned her head and looked at me with such hatred in her eyes. And I just looked back at her and didn't break the glare, didn't take my eyes off hers. She flinched first, then she just changed back. I tried to show her that she didn't bother me, and I think that's what caused her to calm back down. I think she actually stopped and thought about what she was doing. I think it reminded me of the time I told her, or tried to tell her, about Joe.", "input": "", "output": "When did you try to tell her?"}, {"instruction": "When it happened. But she didn't want to hear it. She said I was just looking for attention and maybe even making the whole thing up. I get so mad when I think back on it. She acted like kids didn't do that sort of thing. And I was like, \"Hello?\" But it made no difference. Well, not until Benny came along.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, how old were you when that happened?"}, {"instruction": "I think I was about ten. Definitely not more than eleven.", "input": "", "output": "And where did Joe come from?"}, {"instruction": "He was this kid who lived in the apartment building across from where my mom lived.", "input": "", "output": "He was a kid? How old was he then?"}, {"instruction": "I think he was five or six years older than me. Why, does that matter?", "input": "", "output": "I was trying to get a better understanding of what happened. So when you told your mom, she wasn't supportive or understanding. Did she try to deny it ever happened? You said that things changed when Benny came into the picture. Now, as I understand it, he put an end to the abuse, is that correct?"}, {"instruction": "He sure did. You better believe it. He stopped it all right.", "input": "", "output": "Benny and Joe were about the same age, right? What did Benny do to stop Joe?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm?", "input": "", "output": "What did Benny do to stop it?"}, {"instruction": "To stop what? Oh, shit! I guess I kind of drifted off or something. What were we just talking about?", "input": "", "output": "How did Benny help to stop Joe from abusing you?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. Well, he caught us, I guess. He walked in and found us together. That's what he did. Plus, he was bigger than Joe, and I guess he kicked Joe's ass. That was more than my mother did, that's for sure. You know, this is going to sound weird, but I kind of miss that part of it--the part where Benny would kind of protect me from things. I know he loved me. I figured it all out, you know.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I follow you."}, {"instruction": "Well, he saved me from Joe, that was the first thing he did. Then later, he did other things to protect me. He was protective of me. He broke up with me when he realized he was going to get in trouble. And he tried to get that tape back--the one I didn't have--but he didn't know that at the time. I think he was trying to protect me somehow.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you've told me that you were grateful to Benny for rescueing you from Joe.  I know that you had a sexual relationship with Benny.  But are you sure that you loved him?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, so? What's wrong with loving him?", "input": "", "output": "Nothing. And you don't have to justify that love to me, I understand."}, {"instruction": "But the thing was...I forgot again. What was I going to say?", "input": "", "output": "We were talking about Benny and your mother."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. See, the thing was...she was sort of right. The thing that I remember is that I liked it sort of, so I probably deserved it, too.", "input": "", "output": "No, you didn't. Not at all. Alex, sexually abused children are not to be blamed for being victimized, even if they have a sexual response. You were a very young child. This guy held a knife to your throat. He threatened you and used his physical strength and size to overpower you. You didn't have the ability to protect yourself from him. Look at your younger sisters. They are both smaller than you now. Think back to when you were that size and realize how vulnerable you really were. Can you remember that?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but...I'm sorry.", "input": "", "output": "Why are you sorry?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I guess...I just sort of spaced again.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, are you taking something?"}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "Are you on drugs?"}, {"instruction": "No!  I'm just spaced, that's all.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, it's important to keep yourself focused on the moment. You need to get in touch with your thoughts and feelings right now. Humor me. Stomp your feet on the floor, like this. Good. What do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Haven't we done this before?", "input": "", "output": "We have, but it doesn't hurt to have a little refresher. What did you feel?"}, {"instruction": "My feet hitting the floor, duh. I know, I know--you want me to do this when I start to space out.", "input": "", "output": "That's right. It's okay if you space out. But do it in a safe place.  Here it's okay, although I'd prefer we stayed focused on our conversation. It's important to stay in the moment and not to shut yourself away.  Spacing out is a coping technique that may have worked in the past. But now, you need to rely on your self-awareness to get through. You are doing great work, and I'm impressed with the way you are handling your problems right now. I know how hard it is, and I don't blame you for trying to escape it. But it's important to try to keep yourself from doing that all the time."}, {"instruction": "I know, but sometimes I can't help it, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I do know. Now, Alex, keep up the good work. And I want to urge you to keep getting the support you need from your friends."}, {"instruction": "We're out of time already?", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid so. Next week then? Same time?"}, {"instruction": "All right. Well, thanks dude.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey.", "input": "", "output": "Come in. You're looking rather..."}, {"instruction": "Goofy. Yeah, I know. I can't seem to get this stupid look off my face.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's not exactly what I meant. You do look much happier today than in recent weeks. What's going on with you?"}, {"instruction": "A lot. So much has happened, it's been a busy week. First of all, my mom had the baby last Sunday. A boy, just like they said. His name is Aaron Justin Jarrod.", "input": "", "output": "That's good news, Alex. And how are the baby and your mother doing?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he's doing great, the little trooper, even though he is almost six weeks early--just like me. But my mom...well, she didn't get through it all that well. She was in the ICU for three days. But right now, they have her in the SCU.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it was real weird. I was right there when it happened. See, she was laying there in her bed after she had the baby. The delivery was pretty rough on her, her blood pressure was way up. And while she was just laying there, I saw her eyes kind of roll up to the back of her head, and then she started jerking and stuff. Well, I didn't know what to do. But I went on auto-pilot or something, because before I knew it, that room was crowded with all these people doing shit to her. And they were pushing me out, but I was going, \"No way.\" So, she had this seizure thing. Toxi something...toxemia, I think. She had very high blood sugar, and she stopped breathing for a couple minutes or something. She had no pulse, and they were doing CPR on her. And then she just kind of came back. They're still keeping her in the special care unit and running all these tests on her.", "input": "", "output": "That's awful, Alex. I'm very sorry about your mom. How are you feeling about all this?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know really. A little guilty, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Guilty?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I kind of wished it on her, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, regardless of what you wished, you were not responsible for what happened. Complications during pregnancy are still relatively common."}, {"instruction": "I know, but I guess I feel weird about it, too. I mean, for a minute there...no, for more like an hour or two, I thought she was going to die on us. It's so like...so not real, you know? Here she has this little tiny baby--and he was born on the anniversary of my grandmother's death even, and he's totally too early, and she goes through hell like she did with me--and I'm worrying that she's going to die. Then I'll be finally alone, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you thought you were watching your mother die.  That's a lot of stress..."}, {"instruction": "But it's all so...so not real. I am like...well, totally stoked about Aaron. And my mom has only been able to see him two times. When they had her in the ICU, they wouldn't bring the baby in to see her, and she was crying and totally freaking about that. But you should have seen Mark after Aaron was born. He came up holding him in his big arms, and Aaron is so totally small, he almost looked fake. Mark was beaming with pride. Later, they let me in, and I got to hold him. I never held a baby before. It was so weird. I thought I was going to break him or something.", "input": "", "output": "Babies are tougher than they seem."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, Aaron's pretty tough, that's for sure! But my mom...well, they checked her for epilepsy and put an oxygen mask on her. She was unconscious for seven minutes, and then she had no pulse. It was all a big trauma for her--giving birth, I mean.", "input": "", "output": "I can understand that."}, {"instruction": "Katherine was real happy to hear about the baby, too. I think she sent a huge basket with flowers and stuff to my mom. I wonder why she doesn't have any kids herself. She'd make a great mom, you know? But I'm still worried about my mom. They just moved her to the special care unit this morning; they're watching her pretty closely. I guess now they can bring Aaron to see her. If they don't soon, she's going to freak on them. And I wouldn't want to be there for that.", "input": "", "output": "Well, if they moved her out of the intensive care, we can assume she must be improving."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. She looks so much better. She's starting to get the color back in her skin. And they need to let her breast-feed Aaron, at least that's what Mark and Rosemarie said. What a trip, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, childbirth is quite a miracle."}, {"instruction": "I know. Everything is a miracle. Oh, I almost forgot. Cecil came by last week. He wants me to get ready because Benny's trial is coming up. And I totally forgot to tell him that I changed my mind and don't want to testify. I wanted to asked him to tell them--you know, the courts or something--that I don't want to do it anymore. I just want it to go away. I mean, why should I help them anyway? They got enough on him already without my help. It's not like I don't have something better to be doing with my time.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "What? Why are you looking at me like that? What is that look on your face for?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I was just thinking about the possibilities. If you refuse to do it voluntarily, it's possible they could subpoena you. Also, what if they don't have enough to put him away without your help?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, shit! You really know how to fuck things up, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "I guess I have to be the Devil's advocate sometimes."}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't think that...you don't think they would, do you? Would they call me up on a subpoena? They've got to have enough evidence against him without my testimony. They have the tapes. That should be enough, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know, Alex. I'm not an attorney."}, {"instruction": "You had to do it, didn't you? Oh well, I guess you're right. Okay, so let's say they subpoena me and make me do it. I could forget everything and answer: \"I don't know,\" \"I can't remember,\" and stuff like that. It's just that I don't...I mean I can't do this right now. I don't want to face him again. It just brings it all right back in my face and shit, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand. The letter you read to me was a good start in putting some closure to all this."}, {"instruction": "A good start? A good start? You think that it was only a start? I thought it was a good finish to it all. I told Luke, and he was so cool about it and made me feel a lot better about this. I was able to put it in a different perspective. It was like...I'm so ready to get over this, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I can understand why you want to move on with your life. But I think testifying is part of it, too.  It would give you some control over what happened to you.  It will help you achieve closure."}, {"instruction": "Gee, thanks! You know, I thought that...I thought...well, I keep telling myself that I'm doing good...better with everything. I'm not staying awake all night long, and I'm not walking all over town like I've been known to do. But still there's something else there, deep inside of me, calling out and making me notice that things aren't all completely right. Luke wants so bad to touch me and I'm like, \"Back off dude.\" He's so confused, but he's trying so hard to be a nice guy about it. I don't know. I wish I could hit my head and forget things--forget about Joe and forget about Benny. I wish that it would all just go away.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps it's unfortunate, Alex, but that's not possible. I think you are doing tremendously good work here. You're making huge strides towards getting better and healing your emotional scars, and I know how difficult it all can be. Not a lot of people have the kind of courage you do."}, {"instruction": "Well, you make it sound like I'm some kind of superhero or something. I just want things to be normal, so that I can be a normal person without all this...uh, this baggage and bullshit.", "input": "", "output": "But, Alex, you really have accomplished a lot already. Think about it for a minute. You've literally taken the bull by the horns and faced the issues that most affect your life. I want to you recognize that and try not to diminish the progress you've made."}, {"instruction": "Well, I think I know what you mean. Tony and I have talked about Joe and what he did to me. We talked about Benny and what he did. Tony sort of went through the same thing with Tim, in a way. He said that eventually he began to enjoy the kinky stuff that made him sick in the beginning. So we both kind of understood that part, and it wasn't embarrassing to admit that to him--that I think I liked it sometimes when Joe...uh, when Joe and I, uh...well, you know. But he is like my best friend, and he seems to understand.", "input": "", "output": "And there is another accomplishment. You brought Tony in on this aspect of your life. You have his support. I'd like you to start keeping track of these accomplishment, Alex.  How about a journal? I think it will be helpful to have a record of your thoughts and feelings. It would be useful to have something to look back on, to have a way to measure what you have accomplished."}, {"instruction": "I don't have to show it you, do I?", "input": "", "output": "Only if you want to. It's mostly for you. It would be for your own reference so you can go back and take stock of where you've been and how far you've come."}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I can do that. I sort of already write stuff down. Sometimes, I mean, not everyday. I doodle a lot. I started to work on some paintings again, too. I even brought some more stuff over to Jake at the gallery to see what he thinks. I brought over all of the panels that go with the series I showed you a few months ago. So that's another accomplishment, my artwork. Maybe I can sell some more of them. I guess I'm not a lost cause after all. I'm not hopeless.", "input": "", "output": "There you go! Try to remember these things when you feel like it is hopeless. Good work, Alex."}, {"instruction": "We're out of time, I know.", "input": "", "output": "Almost."}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I better tell you about one more thing real quick then.", "input": "", "output": "What is it?"}, {"instruction": "You may get a call from Marty, my social worker.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, see, I sort of...well, I kind of like...I cut school for a couple days.", "input": "", "output": "You did? Why did you do that?"}, {"instruction": "I did it for about...uh, I don't know, maybe three to eight days.", "input": "", "output": "How many days was it?"}, {"instruction": "Eight. I think they want to expel me or something. But Marty came over to my mom's house on Friday--he doesn't know I live at Ralph's--and told my mom. And you know the funniest thing was that the school never even called or anything like that. Well, they called, but not my house. They called social services, and then someone found Marty and called him. But I went back to school, and they told me to go home.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Well? What can I say? I just couldn't go to school, my head wasn't there, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I know, but I wish you would have told me about this."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm telling you now!", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Alex. I'll try to run interference for you this time. But I don't want you to make a habit out of this. If you need to be out of school, please call me so we can talk about it, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Fair enough, dude. Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, then. See you next week, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. Sorry I'm late. The bus didn't come on time, as usual.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. It's not a problem; I know how that is. So how are you this week?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess. Well, did Marty ever call you or what?", "input": "", "output": "No, he didn't. Have you been going to school?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I've been going. Not that I want to, but I've been going.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad. Did you get into any more trouble over it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm in detention right now. It's sort of reminding me of when I worked in the park last summer because I do clean-up work with this old dude janitor guy. He's all right, kind of quiet--bored maybe. I know I would be bored with his job. Yeah, they got me as a slave. But Marty and I had a nice long talk about school. I guess I better keep going if I want to graduate next year, or if I decide I want to graduate early. The thing is that I kept up with all my homework. I even got a couple of As, which surprised me, because I didn't really try. See, that's the problem with school, it's so boring. I am bored beyond description there these days. I don't know, I guess I have to live with it.", "input": "", "output": "So you have no future plans for cutting again?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't say that.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Alex, if you start being a truant, then there won't be a lot I can do for you on that issue. You'll have to suffer the consequences."}, {"instruction": "I know. Marty said the same thing. I will try to keep myself entertained with it as much as I can. I don't like it. It's so far. It's like way far to go on the train to get to school. And then there's P.E.", "input": "", "output": "What about P.E.?"}, {"instruction": "I hate it, I totally hate it. I don't like competing with other guys in those stupid games. And I don't like having to change my clothes and shower publicly, it really bugs me. I just want to be able to keep my clothes on. I don't want other guys looking at me or seeing me without my clothes on.", "input": "", "output": "It's not uncommon for people who have gone through what you have to feel this way, Alex."}, {"instruction": "There you go! Why do you keep on bringing that up?", "input": "", "output": "It's not going to go away on it's own, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but...well, I don't really want to go there right now, you know? I have a lot of other things on my mind. There's Roly and Benny. And now, there's Aaron and my mom and Mark. Plus, I brought more art work for Jake to look at, and he was surprised. I showed him some of my stippling work, and he really liked it. But my little brother and my mom are home now--they turned her loose last Sunday, one week after he was born, and she's been a bitch ever since. Oh, and those flowers? You know the ones I thought Katherine sent? Well, she didn't send them, they were from everyone at SII. But I did get to talk to her on the phone, though. She said she sent a card to my mom, which was a nice thing to do considering everything. Katherine told me she had an accident while she was in Texas. I wished I made it here on time today so I could have seen her. Is she going to be okay?", "input": "", "output": "She'll be fine."}, {"instruction": "Well, I was sort of worried about her. She sounded...I don't know, kind of shaky maybe. But check this: my mom is being like a complete total bitch. Since she came home with Aaron, she's been acting like she doesn't want me around, and she was practically ignoring the baby. Mark had to like force her to feed him and stuff. Sounds familiar, huh? She is such a bitch! Racyl told me that my mom wanted them to get me to leave or something, to talk me into just leaving. I was like, \"This is so like her...the real her\", you know? She was doing all right for a while. And now that she went through hell having this kid, she's going to make everyone pay. But you know what it reminds me of? It brings me back to the time I tried to talk to her about Joe. Okay, it's my turn to bring it up.", "input": "", "output": "What happened when you tried to tell her about it?"}, {"instruction": "Hello? Where have you been? Didn't I already tell you? I know I did.", "input": "", "output": "You told me what the end result was, but you haven't described what actually happened."}, {"instruction": "Well, it was not long after my grandmother died when it happened. I remember it was just after I turned eleven. She died the day after Valentine's day and then...remember I told you that's when I moved in with her? Well, right across the street, all up and down that side of the street, there were apartment buildings. That was where both Joe and Benny lived. Not together, but they both lived in the same cluster of buildings. And Tony's family lived just up the block a bit. Anyway, ah...shit! I lost my thoughts again. What were we talking about?", "input": "", "output": "You were going to tell me what happened when you tried to talk to your mother."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, right. Well, see...she was a party girl. She was either having a party at the house with her friends, usually guys, and they would drink and smoke and stuff. Or she was out on the town, partying. Well, it got to be so old so fast for me. I mean here were these indifferent assholes hanging around with my indifferent mother, drinking and acting like a bunch of fucked up screw-ups. I made the mistake of telling her something that sobered her up for more than a minute. That was a time when she would get up off her chair, and you could tell her head was spinning. I can't tell you how many times she fell on her butt then. One time, she fell back on the coffee table, and it broke in half! Sofie came in the next day and saw the table there on the floor in two pieces. And I didn't know what to say. So I told her that I broke it.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you do that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I guess I didn't want her to know the truth about my mom, about her partying. My mom and I never spoke about the coffee table incident again after that. But I was real embarrassed about it--her partying and stuff. Tony even saw it, and so did Joe. That's how he got to me, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he told me that if I told, she wouldn't do anything about it. And he was right. Plus, he said if I didn't go along, he'd kill her. He even broke into our house one time in the middle of the night to prove to me that he could easily get in and do what he said he would do. I was convinced, if you know what I mean and I think you do.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So when I tried to tell her, she just looked at me all cross-eyed and said that...well, she said...uh...um, you know I don't remember what she said. That's funny. I remember that soon after was when all the real trouble between her and me started, at least that's when I think it started. Who knows? She never wanted me, she doesn't want me around now. And now, she's starting off with Aaron by being a bitch. So go figure. But the weird thing is that Roly has been visiting me again.", "input": "", "output": "You mean you're having dreams about him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes and no. It started out as a dream. In the dream, I was there with him, and he was trying to tell me that I needed to fix this...this...um, this thing, and it was all broken and stuff. But it was like my life depended on fixing this thing, whatever it was. Talk about a mixed message.", "input": "", "output": "What message do you get from it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's so obvious, duh. He was trying to console me, to get me through this...this...uh, this crap that I'm going through. But see, he still visits me. In the garden, on Saturday, Ralph and I were out there in the rain, pulling up weeds between the roses. And Roly just appeared out of nowhere, he just sort of popped up and was laughing at me. He told me that he never thought he'd see the day when I became complacent. And I was like, \"Complacent?\" He disappeared. So I was like hallucinating or something, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "Not necessarily. It's something I've heard of before. When someone you love dies, their image will sometimes, for lack of a better phrase, haunt you for a time. It's the unconscious mind working it all out."}, {"instruction": "Well, it seemed pretty real to me. Then, I was riding along on my bike in the rain, and I saw him standing on the corner. And he was smiling and waving at me. So I rode in his direction, and he started to run away. I called out to him, and he stopped. But then a truck rolled past, and he was gone. So, I'm feeling like I'm losing my mind. Oh, and that's the other thing. Saturday was a totally weird day. While we were in the garden, I heard what sounded like a lawn mower, and Ralph heard it, too. Then we realized what was going on. The lady next door, she's kind of strange. No, actually, she's kind of stupid. She was out there in the rain with an electric weed-whacker thing, taking out the overgrowth and stuff along the fence. I was thinking this bitch was going to french-fry herself, you know? Then she got her son--he's about four years younger than me--and handed it to him. And he started doing it! I told Ralph to stay away from the fence because it could conduct the electricity, it's one of those chain-link kind. But then, the woman started yelling at her son, telling him how stupid he was. And I was thinking, \"Did you take lessons from my mom?\" It reminded me of how my mom would sometimes talk to me--like I was stupid or something. But the weird and scary part was what we heard on the answering machine when we went back inside the house. Benny called.", "input": "", "output": "He did?"}, {"instruction": "He did. My heart stopped for a second, and then it felt like someone ripped it out of my chest, stomped on it, and then stuffed it back in real sloppy like.", "input": "", "output": "What did he say?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he said he wanted to talk to me, that he got my letter. He said he was grateful that I forgave him. Then, he started to cry. We played it back a couple times, and it was hard to make out what he said. But it sounded like he was sorry and all this other mumbled bullshit. I don't know if it was a full moon or something, but Saturday was a day to remember, if only for the weirdness.", "input": "", "output": "Well, how do you feel about him calling you?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? I don't know. I think I was surprised. It was the last thing I expected from him, so out of the blue. But it felt strange to hear him, to hear his voice, and have him go off like that all crying and shit. He never did anything like that before. My letter must have got to him, you know? I hope he doesn't call again. Right now, I am so over this, and then he called. Maybe that's what Roly was trying to tell me--that I got to fix this. He was trying to tell me something, that's for sure. He's really haunting me, you know? Oh yes, and the final part of all the weirdness was when Sael showed up. He just rang the doorbell Saturday night. He was in town back from school because his grandfather died. But he said he had to come see me before he went back to the East Coast. He said school is hectic, but he loves that kind of pace. If he had stayed here in the city, I would have been with him right now and not Luke, you know? I probably wouldn't even have met Luke. So I was visited by three men of my past this week, how about that? I hadn't thought about it like that before, you know?", "input": "", "output": "It's been quite a week for you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "It has, I'm still reeling. But right now, I can't even go over to the house and see my little brother. Well, I mean I can, but I don't want to deal with her. It's too much for me right now.", "input": "", "output": "It's probably a good idea to lay low right now. Your mother is still adjusting to everything, I'm sure."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well. Oh yeah, I brought something for you. It's this drawing I did soon after I saw Fleetwood Mac in concert last summer. It's Stevie Nicks, and it's all dots. Kind of cool, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Thanks, Alex. Well, we're just about out of time for today."}, {"instruction": "All right, Doctor. See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. Well, you'll never guess what my mom did.", "input": "", "output": "More trouble, huh?"}, {"instruction": "No, and that's what's so surprising. It's a good thing you're sitting down. She apologized to Katherine. Can you believe it?", "input": "", "output": "She did?"}, {"instruction": "You can get your chin off the floor now. It took me a minute to realize that I wasn't dreaming, too. Oh yeah, Katherine probably already told you about this. Oh, well. Anyway, I found out that she wanted to talk to Katherine from Katherine. Last Thursday, I went over to my mom's office to pick up some gifts and stuff from her co-workers, and I ran into Katherine. That's when I saw how hurt Katherine was in that accident she had in Texas--she was using a cane to get around. She told me she had a concussion, and then in the same breath, she told me my mom contacted her and invited her to come over to the house. I stopped her and asked if her concussion was making her delusional, but she insisted that's what my mom said. And you know those people over at SII? What a bunch of busy-bodies. I mean here I was talking with Katherine and feeling like I was on some kind of display or something.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you feel like that?"}, {"instruction": "I looked around and noticed that a lot of people were staring at Katherine and me, and they were all whispering and stuff. It was too weird. What business was it of theirs? I knew that they were talking about us; it was so obvious, they didn't even try to hide it. They were watching me like I was some kind of boy-toy or something. I felt uncomfortable knowing I was the object of everyone's attention, and I think Katherine noticed it, too. But she was too classy to let something like that get to her, you know? So anyway, yeah, my mom asked Katherine over to the house. But you should have seen the look on Katherine's face after she and my mom had their little visit. She looked lost or stunned or something. It was like she doubted what had just happened. Well, I knew what had happened because the same thing happened between my mom and me just before Katherine came.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my mom decided that being a bitch was too much for her or something. She called me into her room--Aaron was totally passed out--and she wanted to talk to me.", "input": "", "output": "What did she want to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "She wanted to say that change is hard for her. And I was like, \"It's hard for me, too.\" But she said she was trying to make changes in her life and that it wasn't coming easy, but she doesn't want to fight anymore. Plus, she let Rosemarie have Aunt Sofie's house, after all. She moved there this past weekend, and now I have the in-law apartment as an art studio. We moved everything in there on Sunday. Ralph was real happy to finally get the paint and chemicals out of his house. But she just wanted me to understand where she was coming from, I guess. And I think she was feeling a little guilty over what she tried to do to Katherine at work and over fighting with Rosemarie. Maybe she figured out that being nice is easier than being a bitch all the time. But I won't be holding my breath or anything, you know? She is like a rabid dog--one minute she's all happy and nice, and the next, she's a raving lunatic bitch. I know what time it is with her, we've been there before, we don't really ever need to go back there.", "input": "", "output": "I understand your apprehension, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well...I'm more than apprehensive when it comes to my mom. But you should see little Aaron, he has grown already. It looks like he gained a few pounds, and he's so strong! He has an incredible grip for such a little guy. He can squeeze my finger real tight. It's such a trip, you know? Hard to believe I was ever that small. Why can't I remember that far back? It wasn't all that long ago. I told Katherine, when she was on her way out the door, that I wonder why she doesn't have kids. I think she'd make someone a great mother, far better than my mom, not that it would be hard to be better than my mom. Well, you know what I mean. But when I told her that she'd be a good mother, her face changed a little and she laughed sort of. And then I think I saw her blush. But it all happened so quickly that I didn't start to think about it until after she was gone. I hope I didn't embarrass her or something. I guess if that bothered her, she would have said something by now. But she didn't seem bugged or anything when I saw her outside. Oh, well. It just struck me funny, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Oh, and Jake's been acting all...I don't know, different, I guess. I see these little half smiles or something coming out. When I brought over more of my work for him, I asked him again who was the buyer of my work. And all he did is sort of smirk or something. He just answered that the person who bought them wished to remain anonymous. It just...um, sort of bugs me a lot. It bugs me a lot, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Why should it bother you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. You tell me. You're the shrink here, you figure it out.", "input": "", "output": "Let me ask you this way, what bothers you about not knowing?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, really. I don't. It's just that I want to know who it was, why they liked my work, what made them like it, and what have they done with it. It's not like they made a major investment--they paid less than a hundred dollars each for them. And they all go together sort of like a story, because they are all done in the same style and medium. What did they do with them? Where are my paintings now? I was sort of attached to each of them, and all I have left of them is a check and some slides, that's it.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Did you deposit the check in your account?"}, {"instruction": "Nope. I kept it. I haven't needed the money, and it's sort of symbolic for me, I guess. It's kind of like that dollar bill you see pasted to the wall at the store--it's their first one, and it means something special. So I haven't brought myself to cash it yet. Hmm, speaking of unfinished business, Benny's trial has been set. It's on the twelfth of March.", "input": "", "output": "That's quick. Have you made up your mind about testifying?"}, {"instruction": "I told you, I don't want to do it. They can't make me. And he called again.", "input": "", "output": "Benny called?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, again. This time, I wasn't home, but Ralph answered and when he realized it was Benny, he told me that he kind of went off on him, gave him a big piece of his mind. From what Ralph told me, they were yelling at each other over the phone.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'm glad I wasn't there for the call. It could've been me that answered. I don't know what I would have done if I had, you know? But Cecil is still all over me about this, and he said they may...oh, how did he put it? They may compel me to do it. That's the same thing as what you said, but I think you called it subpoena. Isn't that what you said?", "input": "", "output": "That's right. I've heard that it can go that way sometimes."}, {"instruction": "Well, I won't do it. How can I get out of it? I mean I don't want to...uh, to look at him. You know, Roly came to see me again. This time, it was in the middle of the night, and he woke me up. He had this thing again. This...I don't know...this thing.. And it was all broken up and messed up, and he wanted me to fix it. He wasn't even making any sense to me anymore. It was just that I had to fix that thing--whatever it is--and everything depended upon it. It was the same as before; it was like a rerun. But he was trying to tell me to fix this...this thing with Benny. I could see that, it was really obvious that it was what he wanted me to do. But I don't know how to, and that's the problem. I think that Roly is going to visit me until I figure it out. He's going to haunt me until I figure this out, you know?", "input": "", "output": "These dreams are leaving a very strong impression on you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "But see, that's where you're wrong. They aren't dreams. It's really his ghost that's visiting me. I think it's because he killed himself, you know? He took his own life, and now he's somehow stuck between life and death or something. But it's real. And you want to know how I know that it's really a real ghost? Because as he was telling me to fix this object that was broken--a totally fucked up piece of garbage--I saw that he left the window open, and I got up to close it. And then, I saw that the trellis was loose, because the wind was making it move. And then, when I turned around, he was gone. You don't believe me. It's okay, because I think I'm crazy, too. You know? I mean who really talks to ghosts? Besides me, that is. Who really does that?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I don't think you're crazy. Sometimes, the unconscious mind can conjure up some bizarre things. But what do you do with this information? Where do you go from here?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I already know he wants me to fix this shit with Benny. He's just using this broken object as a symbol, I think. Does that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "I think so."}, {"instruction": "So he wants me to fix it, and I don't know how.", "input": "", "output": "But I think you do."}, {"instruction": "What? What do you mean? I do? Hmm, you want me to testify, don't you? You think that's what Roly wants. Oh, no. Wait a minute. I'm being ganged up on here. You really think that this is what he means? Oh, no way. I can't. I don't think that...well? I don't want to. I can't, I just can't.", "input": "", "output": "I know it must be hard for you..."}, {"instruction": "Hard? You think it's hard? I think you haven't been paying attention or something!", "input": "", "output": "That's not..."}, {"instruction": "What? I thought by writing that letter I could finally make it end, finally make myself stop thinking about it...about him. But it really hasn't...you know, it hasn't...it only changed the way I see it now. And it scares me what I did--the things I did--all for him, too. It was all for him, for what he gave to me, and for how he made me feel. But it was all a lie, wasn't it? A big lie.", "input": "", "output": "Here are the tissues."}, {"instruction": "Fuck that! I don't need that shit!", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex, I understand."}, {"instruction": "Look, I know we're out of time or something. And it's okay, because I got to go anyway. See? And I just might think about it some more or something. But I don't want to be getting any pressure about this, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I'm sorry. I don't want you to leave so upset. Now, let me say that whatever you decide to do is up to you and I'll support whatever decision you make."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's okay. Yeah, it's okay, see? I'm thinking that I'll just think about it some more, and maybe Roly will stop bothering me, and I'll get over it. But if they compel me to do it, as they said, it would compel Benny to want to kill me, you know? And I sometimes think just how easy it would be for him, if he got out. He would come after me, and that sort of scares me. You should have heard it those times he called me, and then the stupid messages in the mailbox that he left, and then the message on the machine where he's all crying and shit...it's overwhelming me.", "input": "", "output": "I know it is."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what to do.", "input": "", "output": "We'll work on that here."}, {"instruction": "Well, thanks, I guess. I mean...", "input": "", "output": "I know what you mean. Alex, if you need anything, remember I am a phone call away."}, {"instruction": "Okay, dude, thanks.", "input": "", "output": "See you next week then."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. Sorry about that; I needed to talk to Katherine about something. I'm not too late. So, what's up, Doc? Ha! I always wanted to say that!", "input": "", "output": "I see you're in a good mood."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know how good a mood it is, really. I'm feeling a little weird lately. So, they did it.", "input": "", "output": "Did what?"}, {"instruction": "The summons, or the subpoena, or whatever it is it's called, they did it.", "input": "", "output": "You were served?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, sure was. I didn't take it so well, either. It happened last Saturday. Oh! Do you know tomorrow is the big day?", "input": "", "output": "The big day? Oh yes, the trial. Benny's trial."}, {"instruction": "Sure thing. Tomorrow. Last weekend I was out with Katherine. And when we got back to my mom's house, this guy was waiting outside. And he just came right up to me and asked me if I was Alex Rozzi. I said, \"Yes.\" Then he just handed me an envelope--inside were the summons to appear--and he just slowly walked away.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do then?"}, {"instruction": "Well, like I said, I didn't take it very well. And Katherine was there. If it wasn't for her, I don't know what I would have done. I could just feel the blood pumping up into my face. And my eyes were all like...I was feeling like I was going to cry or something. I just sat down on the porch and looked at the paper and Katherine. Well, she didn't know what to make of it. She just sat right down next to me, and we talked about it for awhile: about what it meant and how important it was for me to not do this...this thing.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like Katherine was a help."}, {"instruction": "She sure didn't hurt, Doctor. Yeah, but having her talk to me...you know. She treats me just as if I were her age or something, like an equal. It really did help, I guess. She kind of helped to put things into perspective. I realize that this thing isn't going away on it's own and I have to get over my own personal feelings in all this. I just need to go and get it over with, once and for all. The thing that worries me about it is the thing that Cecil told me.", "input": "", "output": "What did he say?"}, {"instruction": "For one thing, he told me that I am the key witness for the prosecution, which makes me real uncomfortable. Talk about pressure! I don't want to be the one responsible if they end up putting him away somewhere. And I don't think I could really deal with everything that goes along with all that, you know? Plus, he mentioned something about the evidence. There was a problem with it or something, I don't know. He said that often these kinds of convictions are hard to come by even with all the evidence. So they laid a real big guilt thing on me, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And I haven't been sleeping. I sort of got into a fight with Jake. And tomorrow's the day. The day. You know, he even said there is a chance they may dismiss the whole damn case. Can you believe that? So even if I do help them in this--and not that I really want to--but if I do, everything could be for nothing. It's a no win kind of thing, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand how you feel."}, {"instruction": "Well, I tell you now. When it's all over, I'm going to be one happy guy.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me what happened with Jake."}, {"instruction": "Well, that's something else, I'm telling you. You know what the jerk did? Jake the jerk--that's what I've been calling him. Katherine told me it was him. He was the one who bought my paintings.", "input": "", "output": "That's good then. Jake has an eye for..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, save it, Doc. Katherine tried that, too. It was this twisted thing about him wanting to give a gift to Katherine. He went and donated my work, in her name even, to this Youth Alliance thing. And it's kind of a cool place, but that's a different story. He donated them to this place. But the only reason he did it was because of her, you know? It wasn't because of my work, but because she likes me. It's just so...it's kind of...well, I don't know...contrived, maybe. It's so weird! But I went over there--to the gallery and Jake--and I had it out big time. I told him that it wasn't right for him to do it this way, so sneaky. That he should have talked to me about it. And then, on top of it, he made up that bogus story about an anonymous buyer. I thought it was somebody important, you know? That it was someone legit. It took away all the meaning of it for me.", "input": "", "output": "How did he react?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he wasn't happy about it. Voices were raised, and things were said. Before I knew it, I was walking out of there with all my work packed up and tucked under my arm, and with the check he gave me all torn up into pieces on the floor--he refused to take it back. It was kind of ugly. And Katherine didn't know we had this...this...uh, this confrontation. She was completely in the dark about it. That's partly why I was late today. I was telling her about it. About Jake the jerk.", "input": "", "output": "But you said that he donated your art work to the..."}, {"instruction": "The Youth Alliance. Yeah, well. That's about the only good thing that came out of all this. Those pieces are hanging on their wall right now. And I met a few people that work there, and they seemed impressed with my work. In fact, they asked me if I wanted to do something there with them. You know? Like work there or something. It's this real cool place that they are remodeling, with a theater and art classrooms and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's a very good thing to have come out of all this, if nothing else."}, {"instruction": "Well, I can't help but be sort of happy about it. It's getting harder to stay mad at Jake. I'd bet he never guessed something like this would happen. But Josh, a guy from the Alliance, didn't call me until yesterday, and I already had words with Jake on Monday. And the other thing is that at least now I know what happened to my paintings, so there's no more question there. Plus, those people there liked my work, and that kind of reaffirmed things for me. So, yeah, it gets harder to be mad at Jake and that's what I told Katherine. I told her that I was a lot less pissed about it than when she first told me and that I hope Jake isn't still mad about it. It was like I needed to blow off all that steam. Man, was I mad! So you're right, a very good thing has come out of it. I still don't know what I'm going to be doing at the Alliance or if it's a paid job or anything like that.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm happy for you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, man. Oh, since we're talking about my artwork, here's the draft for the one I did for Katherine. I haven't titled it yet.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you."}, {"instruction": "Cool. I hope you like it. So anyway, where were we? Well, I told you about tomorrow. But I guess you already figured out how nervous I am about it. Hmm. You know, I just don't want to be the one to hurt Benny for some reason. Even after everything, I still don't want to be the one who turns against him in all this, isn't that weird? Before, all I wanted was to see his ass fry. And now, all I want is to show him some mercy. But you know something? Katherine helped me to see things differently. And after I made my decision to do it, to testify, Roly hasn't come to see me. So everything is working itself out.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad, Alex."}, {"instruction": "The thing is I haven't really been sleeping a lot these past few nights. And since Tony and Ralph have become such good buddies, they're staying up late and keeping me up talking about everything. You know what they did? And this bugs the hell out of me, too. They got to talking a few weeks ago about that dude, you know? The one who helps people commit suicide? What's his name? Kevorkian. Yeah, that's it. Well, they got into this long-winded philosophical discussion about assisted suicide, and I was so not into this stuff. But these two...well, they just kept it up. And now, all of a sudden, since they both have HIV, they both decided to join the Hemlock Society.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you know about them. Shit! And I thought they were this place that took care of your ashes after you were already dead. But Tony and Ralph both seem to agree that choosing the time and the place is a personal choice. I don't know what to think. I just see it as more notches in the old belt buckle, you know? I already told Ralph that I don't think I can help him with this. And Tony knew better than to ask me, because I made it pretty clear to both of them. It's not like I'm against it or for it, it's just that it's not for me. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "Tony and Ralph wanted you to help them with their suicides?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  But it's really not for me.  But what do you think about  assisted suicide?  Do you think it's okay?", "input": "", "output": "Well, we're not really here to talk about what I think."}, {"instruction": "Oh, come on, I know you have an opinion about this.", "input": "", "output": "I don't believe in making general pronouncements about this issue."}, {"instruction": "So you think it's okay sometimes?", "input": "", "output": "Our time is up. You are making some good choices for yourself, Alex. I want to encourage you to take your time with things.  That's mostly what you've been doing, although it sounds like you're a little sorry about flying off the handle at Jake. And take your melatonin. It may help you to get some sleep tonight; you need to be at your best tomorrow. I think that's very important.  Call me if you need me."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Good luck, Alex. I'll see you next week?"}, {"instruction": "All right. Later, dude. But next time, I'm going to ask your opinion again.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex. And get some sleep, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Hey.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. How are you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. Pissed. Frustrated. I guess I'm getting fucking tired of this damned waiting game.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I told you that Benny's trial started. That was last Thursday, and I was all ready for them to call me up to the stand and do my thing, you know? But it's not going the way I thought it would.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "What happened was those stupid fucking lawyers were busy arguing everything. Every detail, everything! So they are going on and on. And I'm like so over this already, but still they just go on and on and on. We're still on pretrial motions.  But the worst part was when Benny came out. He came out, all shackled at first, and my heart stopped for like a minute. But then, they undid those cuff things he had on, and he looked straight up at me.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, \"Oh!\" He just lifted his head up--and it was the first time he looked up--and he looked right at me, right into my eyes, like it was natural, like it was meant to happen. And the whole room sort of slanted, and everything went in super slow motion. It was like time just stopped or something. My heart was pounding, and I couldn't take my eyes off him, off his eyes. And he lost a lot of weight, too, probably more than fifty pounds. He's real skinny now, his clothes just clung on him. But we were staring at each other, and my heart was all up in my throat. And then, he sort of frowned and dropped his head down. I knew right then, I knew.", "input": "", "output": "What did you know?"}, {"instruction": "That he never meant things to go this far. That he didn't mean to hurt me. It all came flooding back to me in that instant.", "input": "", "output": "Flooding back?"}, {"instruction": "You know, for an educated guy, you sure have a small vocabulary. Jeez! Yeah, flooding back. I could tell what he was thinking just then, it was just like it used to be between us. I could read him like a book. He didn't mean to hurt me, and he was ashamed of what he did. I could tell.", "input": "", "output": "How could you tell that?"}, {"instruction": "I just could, okay? I just could. He looked so...so...uh, pitiful...so broken when he saw me. That's how I could tell. And it was the first time Luke ever saw Benny. Boy, was he surprised and curious. But those stupid damned lawyers...what good are they anyway? So here we were, listening to the bullshit from these lawyers. Boy, that was the last job I'd ever want. And I was waiting for them to start calling witnesses, but they just kept right on talking. They didn't care that I was all sweaty-palmed and nervous, wanting to get this shit over with, you know? Luke grabbed my knee and held tight to make me stop shaking it, like I just noticed I'm doing right now. See? This is driving me crazy! And, of course, there was Roly.", "input": "", "output": "What about him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, last Wednesday night, the night before the trial started, he paid me another visit. This time, just like all the other times--it's like a broken record or something--he kept repeating himself. First, I woke up, and he was sitting on the edge of my bed and looking at me with a small smile on his face. And I was like, \"What do you want now?\" He said, \"I'm glad you're doing it. This is the right thing to do. But you still got to fix this.\" And he opened up his hand, and in it was that stupid broken thing of his--whatever that damn thing is--and it was all broken. At first, I thought I knew what he wanted, it was so obvious. But now, I'm not so sure I understand what he's trying to tell me. What is he really trying to tell me?", "input": "", "output": "I can see you're feeling very confused. Maybe we could put this aside for the moment so it won't bother you now.  Let's figure out the meaning of all this after the trial.  What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "I don't want you  to get all muddled up in trying to figure out Roly's message. And maybe there is no specific message to be learned here."}, {"instruction": "What do you mean by that?", "input": "", "output": "Well, perhaps these dreams of Roly will go away after the trial is over. I think these dreams are your subconscious working out your anxieties about testifying."}, {"instruction": "That I need to do it? To testify? Well, I'm going to testify, duh. And Roly knows that already. So what's the problem? I think Roly is trying to tell me something else, I just don't know what it is yet. So Roly still hangs, subconscious or not. And the trial still goes on and on, without anything happening. This is working my last nerve, you know? When we walked out of the courthouse, Luke got the car and took me out to dinner. Then, we decided to go down to Carmel. He's been so good to me. We walked all up and down that beach. My legs are still kind of aching, and I thought I was in pretty good shape. You know, if my parents had a house right on Carmel beach, I'd never want to leave there. It is such a great place. Luke's dad has this big old stone house right on the beach, and I mean right on the beach.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds nice."}, {"instruction": "Nice is putting it mildly. It is so awesome! When I'm there, I forget all about my problems. That place is magical or something. It's so refreshing there. The air smells so good, it's like they perfume the air or something. But the thing with Luke is that he hasn't been pressuring me for sex or any other physical contact lately. I never really told him everything--about Joe, that is. But he sensed it, and he accepts it, I think. So I finally told him. I told him everything. And you know what? I felt like that beach out there in front of his dad's house--I was totally wiped out, like twenty feet of sand washed away. But the ocean was calm, like I was, and everything seemed to be okay. We raided his dad's wine cabinet and got out a good bottle of wine, and we drank it together. And then, we messed around for what seemed like hours. I had forgotten what a rush it can be--it had been so long!", "input": "", "output": "Well, you do look surprisingly relaxed, other than that shaking leg. I'm proud of you for talking to Luke about Joe. That was a big step."}, {"instruction": "And Luke acts like it doesn't matter to him. Not that he doesn't care, but that it's not important. He thinks it doesn't change anything...um...well, I don't know how to say it right. It's coming out all wrong.", "input": "", "output": "I think I know what you mean."}, {"instruction": "The next morning, Luke and I went out to the beach again, and I found this stick. There's all this driftwood everywhere that's been washed ashore by the storms. I drew this huge mural in the sand before anyone else got there. It took me hours while Luke just sat and watched and laughed out loud a little. After it was all done, I just sat back in the sun. You know, most people didn't walk on it. But these two women and a little girl stopped and admired it. The girl found it first and insisted that the adults stop and look. I was secretly flattered that they were looking at it. And these women sort of both turned and looked at Luke and me, and they smiled in an appreciative kind of way. It was good.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like Carmel was a great getaway for you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. But then Monday came around, and we were back in court. The lawyers started arguing about some other stuff, and it occurred to me what they are fighting about--it was about the evidence. They fucked up the evidence somehow. And Benny just sat there, every once in awhile turning around to look for me and making my heart pound again. But just like Cecil mentioned, they have a problem with the damned evidence.", "input": "", "output": "What problem?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, they fucked it all up.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "I'm still not sure yet. I don't know, but something is wrong with the evidence. The judge is deciding whether to throw some of it out--he's deciding if he should make it so they can't use it in court or something. And the trial is on hold until they figure it out. And with Benny turning around every so often to look at me, this is all so frustrating. Oh, and do you want to know about frustrating? I went to go see Jake the other day, to fix things with him. Hey! You don't think that Roly is trying to tell me to fix this, too? No, it couldn't be. But anyway, I go over to the gallery because I wanted to set things right with Jake, and his assistant just made up some lame excuse why Jake couldn't see me then. But they can't get rid of me that easy. I'll go back, because I need Jake to know that I'm okay with things now and that it all worked out all right.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad.  But try to be patient with Jake. He might need some time to work things out for himself, too."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I thought of that already. Katherine doesn't have an answer, either. She sort of said the same thing as you. I don't know. The Alliance is cool, though, and I'll be working there this weekend.  To start with, I'm going to help them paint backdrops for their stage. Josh and I talked a lot about the different things I can do there. It's all on a volunteer basis, but I figure it's good experience if nothing else.", "input": "", "output": "I think that's true, Alex."}, {"instruction": "So Jake went about things the wrong way. But then this totally unexpected thing came out of it, and how can I be mad anymore? That's all I want to tell him--that I'm not pissed anymore.", "input": "", "output": "You'll have your chance to tell him, I'm sure."}, {"instruction": "Well, he's going to have to see me one way or another, that's for sure. It's just so frustrating for me--this thing with the trial and then Jake. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "I understand your frustration. Give it time, I think things will work out."}, {"instruction": "I guess so. I hate waiting, that's what so frustrating for me, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I know. But your patience will pay off in the long run. I encourage you to continue to think things through and take your time. And actually, you seem to be handling things quite well."}, {"instruction": "I wish I felt like I was dealing with things well, you know? But at least I've been able to get some sleep again. At night--especially these past few nights since the trial started--I've been so wiped out that I just pass out and sleep through the night without even waking up.", "input": "", "output": "Are you feeling rested?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so. I don't know. I haven't really been paying attention to that. I've just noticed that my sleep is different than usual. I guess it's all this frustration that I'm feeling now. So, I know we're out of time, and I got to go anyway--I need to get caught up on my homework. At least school is working with me. Since the trial started--and no one knows how long it's going to last--I had to miss some school again. But Cecil wrote them a letter explaining about the trial and everything, and they are being pretty cool about it as long as I keep up with my schoolwork.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you're staying on top of that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, me too. I don't want any of it to pile up, you know? Well, see you later, Doctor Balis. Oh, and thanks a lot!", "input": "", "output": "See you next week, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "How are things?"}, {"instruction": "Good. Bad. No good...uh, I mean, bad...um, I don't know what I mean. I'm so confused.", "input": "", "output": "Confused? About what?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I'm frustrated, I guess. It's this whole trial thing. It's got me going, I'm telling you.", "input": "", "output": "What happened? Have you testified yet?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, they had me up on the stand all right, for two days in a row! Shit! By the time the second day came around, I had had just about enough. I almost got in some trouble, too.", "input": "", "output": "Trouble?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you heard me. Trouble, with a capitol \"T.\" See, this lawyer...I mean this bitch...what makes people do the stupid things they do anyway? So this lawyer, the prosecuting attorney, was pounding away at me, at my life, and stuff, and she was like a pitbull. When she got ahold of something and didn't let it go, you know? She was relentless. She had asked me probably seventeen different ways what my relationship with Benny was, and she didn't let up. She wanted details, all of the details.", "input": "", "output": "What did you tell her?"}, {"instruction": "Well, what I said almost got me into trouble. She was asking me about my relationship with him and things--like when did we start having sex, how old I was at the time, and stuff like that. It was totally embarrassing, and I couldn't stop looking at Benny. I never saw him that way before.", "input": "", "output": "What way?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he seemed so small, so skinny. He lost a lot of weight. But he was such a small person, you know? And it was the expression on his face that caught my attention. Each time he looked up at me, he looked so sorry, like a shamed puppy dog or something. But that lawyer wanted to know if I would lie to protect him. And I was like, \"No way.\" Then she wanted to know if I helped him with the videos and whether I knew about them. And still I was like, \"No!\" But then she dropped a bomb on me. She wanted to know what I did with the videos--did I still have them? And I almost forgot about that. It was totally the last thing on my mind. I forgot that I burned them. But how could I forget something like that? The smell was horrible! But when she asked me that, I got mad. I sort of got on autopilot, and my mouth took over.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, no."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes! My mouth. You can always count on something to spill out. It's totally out of my control, you know? I was swearing and yelling at her. And before I knew it, the whole courtroom was making noise, and the judge had to tell me to stop, but not before I told that lawyer, \"You think you're 'all that' and a bag of chips, don't you?\" Well, by then the courtroom was rolling in laughter, and the two lawyers came up to the bench and start talking between themselves. The lawyers and the judge didn't realize I could hear them. The defense attorney, Benny's lawyer, said to the prosecuting lawyer, \"The kid's pretty sharp, and he's got you pegged!\" And then I was laughing. The judge came down hard on me, told me to straighten up, and stop being like that. And I was all, \"I'm pissed off, what can I say?\" So they called for a recess, and the judge pulled me and the two attorneys into his office and told me to stop cross examining the lawyers--that that was their job, not mine--and to be more cooperative. So I agreed and apologized. And then we went back out again. And then there were the same stupid questions all over again. It was so frustrating!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, people get charged with contempt of court for what you just described."}, {"instruction": "That was what the judge threatened me with. Well, I was pissed off, and what else could I do? When I was up there, everything was flooding my memory. Before Benny and I split up, I thought things were going just fine between us. We got along okay. We had fun together. He got weird towards the end there, and he treated me badly. But mostly, I thought we had a good relationship, and I would've done anything for him. Anything. And this I think he knew. But I didn't get all weirded out about things with him until after I found out about the tapes. That's when I added things up and figured out it was Benny who ransacked my mom's house. Only then did I start to really get mad at him for being such a sneak, such a liar. That's when I realized that things weren't so perfect. Here he was, having his cake and eating it too, as they say. He had Dora. And they had their baby, little Rose. And then there was me--the third wheel, sort of. I was on the short end of the stick, not to mention that kid--the one he got popped for. But he really wasn't all there for me, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I remember how you felt."}, {"instruction": "That's funny, because I don't really remember how I felt. I remember watching Roly go downhill after that. But I don't know that I really remember how I was feeling about all this at the time.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about it now?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Numb, maybe. Stunned. I feel like I was in a \"kiss me, kill me\" thing. Kiss me, kill me. Kiss me, kill me. It's an Alfred Hitchcock movie.", "input": "", "output": "That's an interesting expression."}, {"instruction": "I stole it from someone. That guy that used to hang out at the club, at Ralph's club. His name was Steve, and he was this real tall guy with the funniest sense of humor. He always said the most hilarious things. Yeah, \"kiss me, kill me.\" You can't win. Especially when the lawyers are in it, you can't win. So Monday, after I did my time on the stand, I got up to leave, and Benny stood up and almost yelled, \"I didn't mean to hurt you, Alex.\" Well, my heart just nearly jumped up out of my chest. And I stood there, stunned, just looking at him while they all went crazy and pushed him back down in his chair. I hated to see him that way, I just hated it. After I left there, I went home and started to paint. I think I must have painted for hours and hours before Ralph came out and got me to come back up inside the house. Oh! And that's another thing. Ralph decided to lay out his plan for me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, remember I told you about the Hemlock Society? He has all his plans all laid out and stuff. He wants me to help him, if and when the time comes. You know what he wants to do? He wants to take this drug combination thing and have me stand by and watch him die. Then--and this is the kicker--he wants me to put a plastic bag over his head in case he doesn't die, because I guess there's a chance that he won't die from the drugs. Pretty sick, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Well, how do you feel about all this?"}, {"instruction": "It's \"kiss me, kill me\" all over again, you know? I feel like I can't do it. I feel like it's too gross or something. Just thinking about it makes me all crazy. That's probably the wrong way to say it, I know.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell Ralph how you felt about it?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well...I tried to tell him, but he wouldn't listen. He heard me and all, but he wouldn't take no for an answer. I am all he's got, and he's pretty much all I've got, you know? I don't want to see him die. And I don't want to see him sick or suffering. But putting a plastic bag over his head...well, that's murder or something. I could go to jail for that.", "input": "", "output": "You could."}, {"instruction": "It would be difficult to explain. More like impossible. It's not like he'd be able to pull the bag over his head himself after taking all those pills. Isn't there a law against this? How can the Hemlock Society give instructions on how to kill yourself?", "input": "", "output": "Giving instructions is not against the law. There are even books about it."}, {"instruction": "Anyway. That night, after court and all that painting, I went straight to bed and slept through to the next morning. And now I realize that no matter how much sleep I get, it's never enough. I always feel tired now. I keep having these dreams, these weird dreams that go in slow motion. They are more like nightmares and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Can you describe them to me?"}, {"instruction": "I don't even think I can describe them to myself. They're just weird and wild. But I do thank Ralph everyday for that punching bag, though. You know, if I didn't have that, I think I'd lose it completely. I'd go natural blotto. And Luke has been on the East Coast since last Wednesday, and he won't be back for another week. But I'm okay with that, I guess. It's not like I'm dependent on him, but I wish he was here, with me, reminding me to stop shaking my leg--he grabs my knee--I miss stuff like that. I hear they recessed the court again and will wrap it up pretty soon. But I don't need to go back for anything really, except maybe to see how it all comes out. But they all have to go back next week sometime, so I have time to think about what I want to do.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel right now?"}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "What do you feel about this?"}, {"instruction": "I feel real calm, almost like the calm before the storm. It's kind of scary, you know? All this has been going on for so long. It's almost like it isn't really happening. But it is, and I'm real afraid of what will happen next, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What are you afraid of?"}, {"instruction": "Not knowing, mostly. Not knowing what will happen. What if he gets off? Will he try to kill me? \"Kiss me, kill me\" all over again. Will he go to jail for a long time, or will it be short? So many questions are flying around in my head, I can't even keep track of them all. I am worried about it. I almost don't want it to come to an end. But I got to move on, so it's got to end. I guess I have a lot of tension built up because, as you can see, I haven't stopped shaking my leg or shifting in my seat. I can't relax and get comfortable. But when I do relax, for bed that is, I'm out in no time at all. If Ralph lets me, I sleep for twelve hours or more, like I did on Sunday. But last Saturday, I made a real good first impression--I showed up at the Alliance almost an hour late. I overslept.", "input": "", "output": "How did it go there?"}, {"instruction": "Other than being late on my first day there, it went good. I had a good time. I actually forgot about the trial for a few hours. I painted these great clouds, real big, on a deep blue sky. They are really plain, but they look like real clouds, and they can use them on stage. That's what they are for, I mean. I had a good time. I met some other kids, mostly younger than me. But some real cool people were there. Josh seems to be pretty cool. He didn't seem upset that I was late. He actually seemed relieved to see me. But I won't be late next Saturday. Oh, and another thing which is pretty cool, my mom and Mark are getting married.", "input": "", "output": "They are? That's good."}, {"instruction": "You know, I said exactly the same thing. Yeah, they told me Friday night when I went over there for dinner. Mark was hinting that he would like me back at the house with them. Oh, yeah! And he wants me to be his best man, isn't that cool?", "input": "", "output": "That's great, Alex. This is good news."}, {"instruction": "It's something that I always dreamed of. And now, it's almost like it's too late for me.", "input": "", "output": "Why would it be too late?"}, {"instruction": "Well, now they got Aaron, and he's quite a handful, too. But now that they got him and I'm almost an adult--well, I am an adult now, practically--it's just not the same as I thought it would be. But it's a good thing that finally my mom is getting married. Her name won't be Rozzi anymore. It'll be my middle name--Jarrod. Rozzi sounds better, though. Oh, well. So, pretty cool, huh?", "input": "", "output": "It is, Alex. Well, we've run out of time for now. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, thanks, dude.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "You should've been there, Doctor. You should've been there!", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. What are you talking about?"}, {"instruction": "The trial, it was a huge shock. They brought in a surprise witness and Cecil was so funny about it, it was the only day that he showed up and they bring out a fucking surprise witness! Cecil was beside himself, even though he tried not to show it.", "input": "", "output": "Who was it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, let me backtrack for a minute. Guess who else was there? My mother.", "input": "", "output": "She testified?"}, {"instruction": "No, no, I'm sorry. Ha! I didn't mean for it to come out that way! You should've seen the look on your face! No, my mom went to the trial. She was in the courtroom when I did my second day on the stand--when I got pissed off at the lawyer--only I didn't have any idea she was out there. I mean, there were so many faces all looking at me, their eyes were piercing right through me, it felt like. So, anyway, she was there! And I'm like, great! Now she knows a lot more than I ever would have told her, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Why did she go, did she say? Uh, Alex...what is that odor? Are you smoking again?"}, {"instruction": "What? No! No, I'm not...uh, smoking, no. I've just been around people who, uh, do I guess. You can smell it on me, eh?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do smell...something. Sorry. Well, what did she tell you?"}, {"instruction": "My mom? Oh yeah. She said she went there out of curiosity, I guess. I didn't see her there, otherwise I think I would have kept my mouth shut. She got a kick out of my exchange with that woman lawyer though! She said it was vintage me, it was almost like she was congratulating me for it or something. But now I'm like so embarrassed or something, you know? She heard a lot of shit, stuff she can use against me. She heard about the crank Benny and Roly were doing. I remember that so vividly. That's when Roly started having these paranoid delusions and shit. He was freaking about every little thing. He even took the electrical outlets apart one time because he thought they were bugged. I never understood that bit of paranoia until I thought again about the secret videotapes Benny made, then his paranoia made sense to me. But anyway...uh, where were we?", "input": "", "output": "Are you feeling okay, Alex? You look sleepy. You seem kind of scattered."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm fine! Jeez! What's wrong with you? You keep asking me all these questions.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I noticed the smell of smoke on you as soon as you came in and I distinctly remembered you telling me you quit. I also noticed that you have dark circles under your eyes and you seem kind of tired. How much sleep are you getting?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I've been sleeping a lot lately. At least more than normal for me. I don't feel like walking or even riding, even though I rode three times this week. But it seems like no matter how much sleep I get, it's never enough or something, I don't know. Why?", "input": "", "output": "I'm just concerned about you, Alex. That's all."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm okay, all right? I'm just fine, I'll get over this sleep deprivation thing I'm going through...always do. So, yeah, now my mom probably thinks I did crank, too. I mean, I never did or anything. I hated the fact they were doing it. But now she probably thinks I did, even though she hasn't said anything yet. But she will eventually, I'm certain she will ask me about it, once it clicks in her head as ammunition.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, aren't you and you mother getting along still?"}, {"instruction": "We are, I guess, but...you never know with her, you know? Where she's concerned, I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming. But, oh yeah! The surprise witness was this guy...his name is Mike McCann. They were kids together. The story that he told was...um, I don't know. It was bizarre, actually.", "input": "", "output": "What did he say?"}, {"instruction": "He said that they were childhood friends and that Benny introduced him to sex when they were both like six years old. I guess Benny got this guy to do all kinds of different things with him and they had gotten in trouble for it. Benny got in trouble for it mainly because there was some threat involved. Like if that kid wouldn't do it, then Benny would do something to him, like Joe told me he would do, but Joe was a lot older than me. It also reminded me of Jimmy, for some reason.", "input": "", "output": "Who's Jimmy?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't mentioned him before? He was my best friend in the whole world when I was little. He lived five houses down the street from me and we did everything together. I never told you about him? That's funny, he was a big part of my life since we were small. My grandmother and his mother were good friends and they used to take us everywhere, to all these different places. I even have this picture of him and me, framed. We were about six or maybe seven and we were at the beach, holding hands, running away from the water towards the camera. It's a great shot and I remember the day it was taken. But the reason it reminded me of Jimmy was because he was the first person I saw who had the same, uh, equipment as me, you know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "I think so."}, {"instruction": "Good, cause I don't really feel like explaining it to you. Anyway he was the first one, I guess. It was all innocent, really. There were no threats involved, just curiosity I guess.", "input": "", "output": "What happened to him?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm?", "input": "", "output": "Where is he now? Alex, did you hear me?"}, {"instruction": "What? Uh...oh! I was just thinking, sorry about that. I drift sometimes. What did you ask me?", "input": "", "output": "Where is Jimmy now?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I don't. Really. See, one day I went up to his house after school. We went to grammar school over at Eureka Valley together and he didn't show up for school that day. Usually we walked together, but for some reason we didn't that day and I don't remember why. But he was out from school a lot, so I would just go over to his house after school and we'd play and stuff. But this one day, well, I went over there and knocked on the door but no one answered. When I went around to the side window, I could see into the house and it was empty.", "input": "", "output": "You mean no one was home?"}, {"instruction": "No, I mean the house was empty. Nothing. No furniture. Nothing. They were gone. They moved away and no one said a word to me about it. They were just gone!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, that's must have been traumatic for you."}, {"instruction": "Well, my grandmother was no help. She wouldn't say anything about it. She just said, \"I don't know.\" Never explained anything to me. Didn't try to make me feel better that they disappeared like that.Weird, huh?", "input": "", "output": "That is rather strange, Alex. How did it make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I was perplexed. It made me feel so unimportant, like it wouldn't matter to me that they were leaving. To this day, I have absolutely no idea what happened to him. That guy up on the stand even looked like Jimmy in a way. It was too weird. So anyway, this guy tells his story about how Benny fucked him over big time and how it still affects him now and everything. It was really a sad story and the whole courtroom was, like, waiting for a pin drop or something. So anyway, to make a long story short, they found him guilty.", "input": "", "output": "They did?"}, {"instruction": "You don't have to ask, cause I know you're going to anyway. I feel funny about it. I think I knew that they would find him guilty, but I didn't expect it so fast. They wrapped everything up real smooth and fast and it kind of knocked my head to spinning. The penalty phase is postponed for a few weeks, so I still have to wait some more for it to be over. I think I'll write a book about all this, you know? I feel bad and all, but somehow I feel less guilty about it too.", "input": "", "output": "Why would you feel guilty?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. I just do, in a way. Like I am partially responsible for what happened to Benny.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, based on what I know and what you've told me, I think Benny did all this to himself. Your testimony may have helped justice along a little, but I believe he would have ended up in prison one way or another."}, {"instruction": "I know. It's just...well, uh...I don't know. I'm mixed up about this somehow. I guess it'll register in my head after I process it all some more and then I'll be okay about it. I'm worried about his sentencing, but I know there's nothing I can do about it. That doesn't stop me from worrying about it though. Oh, and that's another thing--Jake.", "input": "", "output": "Did you get a chance to talk to him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes and no. I mean, I went over there to talk to him, to tell him everything is okay for me, but somehow I got all stuck on the fact that he made up this story about the bogus buyer of my work. We started out okay, but then something happened, something was said and I just...I just sort of lost it again.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know what came over me. Other than the fact that I just don't understand where he came up with that story and why he just didn't tell me the truth about it. I mean, he had me all built up there for awhile and then, bang! It was all just a silly little game. But that's what I'm worried about, that things between Jake and me aren't getting any better and I worry that this might affect my relationship with Katherine. You know, I don't even see what she sees in him. She can do, like, so much better. But that's what it was all about this time. It's like, don't lie to me about anything because eventually I'm going to figure it out. I always do.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe now is not the time to try and fix things with Jake. I'd let it rest for awhile. You still have issues about it and I'm sure Jake does too, so let it cool down a bit. You'll be able to work it out with him, I'm certain."}, {"instruction": "We'll see, I guess. Well I should be going now. I've got tons of homework to do and most of it is due Friday.", "input": "", "output": "We are about out of time, Alex. So I'll see you next week. Oh, and Alex? Good work."}, {"instruction": "Good work? For what?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I was just thinking back to when I first met you.  In the past--not so long ago, really--you had a tendency to deal with difficult situations with violence.  Now, you're trying to do without the violence.  I'm proud of you for that."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, I guess. I haven't been feeling like I need to go that far. I don't know, maybe I'm thinking more, pounding less. Hard to say what has changed, if anything, you know? It's not like I didn't think about popping Jake in the mouth, but we're too evenly matched I think. Oh well.", "input": "", "output": "Good work, Alex. Take care and I'll see you next time."}, {"instruction": "Hey, dude! How's it hanging?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex."}, {"instruction": "You don't have to say anything. I already feel bad enough. So just don't, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Alex?"}, {"instruction": "Well, you did talk to Marty, didn't you?", "input": "", "output": "No, I didn't speak to him. What's going on, Alex?"}, {"instruction": "You're kidding? You didn't talked to him? Really?", "input": "", "output": "No, really, I didn't. What's up?"}, {"instruction": "Oh. I...uh, shit! Me and my big mouth. Can we just forget I brought this up or something?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I really would like to know what happened."}, {"instruction": "I don't really want to talk about it, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, if Martin is going to contact me, I'd like to know about it. Tell me what's going on."}, {"instruction": "Well...um, I don't know how to start, really. It's just...well, I kind of...I sort of got into some trouble last weekend.", "input": "", "output": "What sort of trouble?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I...um, I ended up at Juvenile Hall.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do to land yourself there?"}, {"instruction": "At first, it was a joke. Really. It was a dare. See, I was out with Regina and Camille, and we were at this electronics store. And I don't know what came over me, but I...uh, I got popped for shoplifting.", "input": "", "output": "Really? Alex! What made you do that?"}, {"instruction": "I told you already, it was a dare. I guess. I don't know. It just sort of happened. I was there and the radio was there--all unprotected and stuff. And Regina said to me that I didn't have the guts to do this. And I was like, \"I've done shit like this before, it's no big deal.\" So she just dared me to do it, and...well, the next thing I knew, I was walking out of there with cuffs on. And Regina and Camille were trying to act cool about it. I don't know why I did it, I just did it. And I don't need any more shit about it, so just don't.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I'm very surprised."}, {"instruction": "I said don't! Just don't. I already feel bad enough, okay? My mom is furious. Ralph is totally freaking. And Luke is in the dark about all this, but he's mad at me for something else altogether--that's a different story. But I really don't need any more shit about it, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, aren't you still on probation?"}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor! Gee, tell me something I don't already know. Shit! Yes, I am on probation. Satisfied?", "input": "", "output": "What's going to happen now?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean what's going to happen? I already told you what happened. It's not like I'm proud of myself or anything.", "input": "", "output": "And who are these girls you mentioned?"}, {"instruction": "Regina and Camille? They're a couple of lipstick lesbiterians I met at the Alliance. We paint together, and we party together and...oh shit! My fucking stupid mouth again.", "input": "", "output": "A lesbiterian?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you know? A lesbian. They're a couple of real cool lipstick lezzies. Katherine didn't seem very impressed with them when she saw them last Saturday, though. She sort of just looked at them in a weird way. But what can you expect when Regina has everything above her neck pierced? Katherine got the eye from both of them, I noticed that right away. They really liked her. They're funny, though.", "input": "", "output": "And you party with them?"}, {"instruction": "I knew you would grab hold of that. Yeah, we party together. They're a kick in the pants!", "input": "", "output": "What exactly do you mean by \"partying?\" Are you taking drugs, Alex?"}, {"instruction": "No! No way! Shit! No, I'm not on drugs. I mean not really. We just partake in the gonja sometimes. That's okay, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "You're smoking pot?"}, {"instruction": "Well, sometimes. We like to do it before we paint, it makes it flow so much better. My creative juices just start totally flowing, you know? It's kind of cool.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I don't advocate the use of recreational drugs for any reason whatsoever."}, {"instruction": "Gee! Do you really think that I care what you advocate? I mean, really! It's just a little dope, it's no big deal. It's not like I'm out stealing for drug money or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you are just out stealing."}, {"instruction": "Oh, touch\u00e9, Doctor, touch\u00e9! That hurt.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex, but you don't seem to realize the gravity of the situation you are in. You come here and tell me that you got arrested for shoplifting. Then you tell me that you're using drugs to enhance your artistic endeavors. The warning signs..."}, {"instruction": "But it's not a problem. Man, you really get worked up about things easy, don't you? I realized the shoplifting thing was a problem the moment I did it. Gosh! Your face got pretty red there. You should prescribe yourself a chill pill or something, you know? So, the second I did it, I knew it was the wrong thing to do. But by then, the wheels were in motion, and I was just doing it. It was as if the entire place started spinning, and my head was rushing. And I was like...I don't know, getting off on it or something.", "input": "", "output": "Were you under the influence when you did it?"}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "Were you high when you did it?"}, {"instruction": "No! I don't think so. Um, I don't think I was. I can't remember. That's funny.", "input": "", "output": "Not really."}, {"instruction": "Man! You're really some kind of old dude sometimes, you know that? It's not like I'm smoking it every minute of every day. I told you, we smoke before we start to paint, and then the whole thing just comes together beautifully.", "input": "", "output": "What will be the result of violating your parole?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure yet, and I'm kind of worried about that, too. The store decided not to press charges against me, but that didn't get me off the hook. The only reason the store didn't press charges was because I used my wiles on the woman who runs that place.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I sort of charmed her. I caught her staring at my crotch a couple times, and then I just turned on the old charm and moved around just so. And the next thing I knew, Marty told me they aren't pressing charges. And I knew it was because I flirted with the old lady, you know? But that still doesn't get me out of the mess I'm in. Marty said the court may decide that I'm an incorrigible and that my mother doesn't have control over me--little do they know that she never did have control over me.", "input": "", "output": "What will happen then?"}, {"instruction": "Well, they could decide to make me a ward of the court or something. But...I mean look at me. Do you think that they would take someone who is almost eighteen and make them a ward of the court?", "input": "", "output": "It's hard to say what they may do, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Well, there's no way I'm going into some foster home thing. I won't go, and they can't make me. I bet they'll throw it out anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, the court will see that you are intelligent enough to understand the consequences of your actions and decisions."}, {"instruction": "So what's your point?", "input": "", "output": "My point is that you know better, Alex. I know that..."}, {"instruction": "Look, let's not go there, okay? I really do feel bad about this. I've got to take what's coming to me, I know that. But I'm getting tired of courtrooms, though. So let's talk about something else now, okay? You know that I'll tell you everything when it comes down, so let's drop it for now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. But, Alex, I'm really surprised by you."}, {"instruction": "You know, sometimes, I even totally surprise myself. So let's talk about Luke. He's pissed off at me now.", "input": "", "output": "Why? Because of the shoplifting?"}, {"instruction": "No! He doesn't know about that, and I don't plan to tell him. The other night, he and I were getting ready to fool around, and he saw these welt marks on my thighs. First, he was concerned. But then he was pissed and turned totally jealous, especially after he saw the marks on my butt. He thought I was fooling around behind his back or something.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Where did the welt marks on your legs come from?"}, {"instruction": "I thought I explained that already. Camille did it.", "input": "", "output": "Huh?"}, {"instruction": "Camille. She did it to me. Those crazy lesbiterians are into a little S&M, and they sort of used me as their whipping boy. It was fun!", "input": "", "output": "Their whipping boy? Are you practicing S&M?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'm not practicing S&M, I just dabbled in it a little. It kind of hurts a little, but it was a real rush, too. The next day, after I played with the girls, I hurt so bad. My butt was raw. But all I could think about was Camille's flogger and what those two did to me. It was like I wanted to go back for more. Those girls are crazy as hell.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And you met them at the Alliance?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, they volunteer there too. They like to paint, and they like to party. They're a lot of fun.", "input": "", "output": "Does it bother you that Luke is upset about this?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know why he needs to be, it's nothing really. It's not like I am having sex with them or anything. I was just having some plain old fun. Somehow, I think I got him to understand that. And maybe next time, he'll come along. But I don't dare tell him about the shoplifting thing, or he'll go off on me big time.", "input": "", "output": "You think it's a good idea to keep this secret from him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's better than dealing with his wrath over it. I know he'll never understand this one. It's not like I don't have the money to buy what I stole, so I can't use that excuse, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What about the truth?"}, {"instruction": "He won't understand. You know, this is getting so old so fast. You're really bugging me today, you know that?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex. I'm not here to sugar coat things for you."}, {"instruction": "Very good, Doctor. I think some of my sharp tongue is wearing off on you. Very good! I know you're not here to sugar coat things for me, I'm not stupid. Jeez! I don't think that Luke would take it well, and I'm just not ready to go there with him. Sue me.", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think he'll figure it out when the court doles out your punishment?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm going to wait and see on that. I'll decide what to tell Luke when the time comes. Oh, by the way, guess what I got in the mail the other day? A check. It was from Jake. I guess he realized that having his arm in a sling doesn't give him a license to be a jerk. He wrote another check and mailed it to me. I think he's trying to tell me he's cool with things now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Are you going to cash it this time?"}, {"instruction": "I already did. Actually, I deposited it in my bank account.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. It was a nice thing for him to do, Alex. Are you going to go back and talk to him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. With everything that's going on between him and Katherine right now, I think he has a lot of shit to deal with. So I don't want to bother him. Maybe I'll call him or something. I got to go now. I'm meeting Mark. We are going to get measured for our tuxedos for the wedding. We are out of time, aren't we?", "input": "", "output": "We are. I'll see you next week, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Okay, man, later on!", "input": "", "output": "And please, Alex, stay out of trouble."}, {"instruction": "What's so good about it? I mean, jeez!", "input": "", "output": "What's the matter?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Marty called me today to tell me that they've scheduled a parole hearing or something like that. He said that it doesn't matter that the store isn't pressing charges. I still got arrested and went down to juvie. And now, I may have to spend some time with one of those ankle bracelet things strapped on, and stay at my mom's house on the weekends while I'm doing it. So why don't you tell me again what a good afternoon this really is.", "input": "", "output": "You might be under house arrest?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe. And at my mom's house, too. Can you believe it? I asked Marty how he knows that this is what they'll do to me. He said that he spent some time talking with the...whomever it is that makes these decisions about my life. Anyway, Marty told them that I am not really all that bad and all. Oh, and he said that it helps that I'm still seeing you. Marty thinks they'll do as he recommends: house arrest and more community service work. But this time, I'll probably be picking up trash on the Great Highway or something.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it's certainly better than going to jail or being made a ward of the court."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but the worst part is that I have to stay at my mom's. It will probably drive me crazy or something. She's so pissed at me that she isn't even talking to me right now. She doesn't want me to be around her or Aaron. She just slams things around when I'm in sight, and she's using the baby as a tool to punish me. And Ralph is in on the act, too.", "input": "", "output": "What's going on with him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he's pissed at me, too. I got everybody pissed at me right now, even Luke. I mean...whatever. It seems like the only person who doesn't hate me right now is Katherine, but give her time. So Ralph is mad at me over the whole shoplifting thing. Then he found out that I went inside his bar again. And not to mention what happened with his car...", "input": "", "output": "What were you doing at Ralph's bar? And what about the car?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the car is one of the stupidest thing I've done lately. I was borrowing it last weekend while he was out, and I sort of drove it into a ditch.", "input": "", "output": "Sort of?"}, {"instruction": "Here we were--Tony, Regina, and Camille--just driving along. And Camille was talking to Regina about this stupid soap, and I was listening to them not realizing they were talking about soap. I thought they were talking about real people. And I was looking in my rearview mirror at her and listening, when all of a sudden there was a car right there in front of me. I swerved to try and miss it. And the next thing I knew was wham, bang, crunch! The stupid car was in the ditch. And it was stuck for three hours. A bunch of people tried to help, but we couldn't get it out. Then, finally, the tow truck showed up. He pulled it out, and there was not even a scratch on it. I was so embarrassed and boiling mad, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But while I was waiting there, all this stuff just sort of came to me: Benny, and Roly, and even Jimmy. You know, since I told you about him, I've been having these dreams and memories of him. I wish I knew where he was, you know? And Benny...well, they are sentencing him on the same day that I am having my own day in court, so I won't get to see what happens to him. And Roly keeps visiting me in my dreams, too. I wish he didn't kill himself. I wish he was still here; I really miss him a lot.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So all this shit was flying around in my head. And I was sitting there with this car stuck in the stupid ditch, all ashamed of myself--I should have known better, you know? How did I do that? How did I get the damn car in the ditch in the first place? It was a good thing no one called the police, because I don't have a driver's license.", "input": "", "output": "You don't?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and that's the main reason Ralph is so pissed off at me.", "input": "", "output": "You were driving a vehicle without a driver's license?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. So? I mean...And?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I know the trial was a very stressful and these memories you are experiencing can be overwhelming. But don't you think that these chances you are taking--shoplifting, marijuana smoking, driving without a license--well, you get the picture. This doesn't add up to anything positive. I am very concerned about you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, so don't be, okay? It's not like I'm out murdering people or hurting somebody.", "input": "", "output": "Other than yourself, you mean."}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, these things you are doing are only hurting you. Violating probation hurts you. Using illegal substances is harmful to you. Driving without a license...Alex, I don't mean to be constantly lecturing you, but this is too much even for you. And I think you know that."}, {"instruction": "Well, what can I say? I've been driving since I was fourteen and I never had a problem before. The shoplifting thing was just...I don't know, it was nothing, a one time thing, believe me. And smoking dope never hurt anybody. Even Katherine didn't seem as concerned about it as you are. She asked me about it, and it's not like I was going to lie to her about it--about anything, for that matter. She's my only real friend right now, you know? She's the only one who is there for me, not judging me.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I am here for you, and I am not trying to judge you."}, {"instruction": "Well, you're not trying hard enough!", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps. But you know when you are doing something wrong, something that can get you into trouble. So then I have to ask you this: Why do you put yourself at risk?"}, {"instruction": "How do I answer that? I don't know. Some things are worth the risk. Some risks give me a major rush. And then other things, things like what happened with the stupid car, totally blow. So I don't know why I do it sometimes. I just don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, let's move on for now. What about Ralph's bar?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, I was hoping you were going to forget about that. Well, Saturday night, I was out with Regina and Camille and Tony again. We were walking down Polk Street, and Regina was acting very bizarre. She always pops off with the funniest thing. You know what she said?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "We were walking along, noticing all the straight couples walking around, hand in hand, publicly displaying their heterosexuality, kissing and stuff--totally gross. And we were talking about that guy, you know the one who got gay-bashed a few weeks ago and died? Well, she just blurted out, \"Hey! Why don't we find a straight couple and beat the shit out of them?\" I wasn't sure she was joking, but I wasn't about to go there. So we went by Ralph's club instead. I got the bright idea that Saturday night was an amateur strip night, and I thought it would be fun to go inside and watch.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, before I knew it, the girls had me talked into doing it again--getting up there and showing off my business. I thought no one knew me there, you know? Ralph told me that he hired a bunch of new people. And I didn't think that the bartender I knew, Kiwi, was going to be there--he never worked Saturday nights before. But Kiwi was there, and he recognized me, even with this short-cropped hair. And so he called Ralph. Well, Ralph came down to the club himself and threw a fit. He's very mad at me for that. I just can't win.", "input": "", "output": "You can win, Alex. You can stop all this nonsense if you put your mind to it. I know you can do that. You've done it before, you can do it again. Remember the mindfulness exercises we did?"}, {"instruction": "The knee-slapping, floor tapping stuff?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I remember. But these days, I get my knee-slapping from Camille--she knows how to do me right. And that's why Luke is still pissed at me--he doesn't understand. He doesn't even want to try to understand. He thinks S&M is something that sick people do. But I think that this is what keeps some people from going totally blotto, becoming real sickos. A little S&M every now and then never hurt anybody. Well, I mean it does hurt, but that's what so good about it. It's an exercise in extremes, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, we were talking about mindfulness. You know, the marijuana smoking will inhibit your mind from working to its fullest capacity. It can hinder your ability to be mindful and to make good choices. You seem to be lacking in good choices these days."}, {"instruction": "Oh, thank you very very much! And I suppose you always make the best choices.", "input": "", "output": "No, not always. No one does. But most people try to have a clear head when they're making choices."}, {"instruction": "Here we go! So now you're going to cite the evils of weed! Well, I saw the movies \"Refer Madness\" and \"Assassin of Youth,\" and it's all a bunch of lies. Have you ever smoked pot, Doctor? Wait! You're going to tell me you never inhaled, right?", "input": "", "output": "No, I'm not going answer that question. Alex, we aren't here to talk about my virtues or failings. We're here to help you get things going right in your life. You seem to be on a collision course of self sabotage. What are we going to do about that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Let it run its course?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you have control. When you're doing something that can get you into trouble, you can ask yourself why you're doing it. What is your motivation? Just stop and think for a moment."}, {"instruction": "Stop and think?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. It's not that hard, and you can do it to humor me, okay?"}, {"instruction": "I always do.", "input": "", "output": "I'm serious, Alex."}, {"instruction": "So am I. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. Look, I know you're trying to help me and all, but maybe this is just a phase I'm going through. Maybe I just need to go through it so I can get over it.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I really don't. Katherine was more concerned about my new friends, the girls. She didn't realize they were lesbians, she even thought I was having sex with them or something. She didn't come right out and say it, but she seemed to hint at it a little.", "input": "", "output": "Well, this new friendship has struck me rather strangely, too. It seems somewhat out of character for you to be hanging around with girls like that."}, {"instruction": "Like what? Lesbians? There's nothing wrong with having a couple of lesbiterians as friends.", "input": "", "output": "That's not what I meant. These two girls seem a little wild, and you've been involved in some questionable activities when you're with them."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, so? I have a lot of fun with them. Tony likes them, too. No one else seems to like them--not Ralph, not Luke, especially not my mother. And like I said, I could tell Katherine seemed a little funny about them, too. Oh well, you can't please everybody.", "input": "", "output": "That's true. Now, we're out of time. I'd like to ask you once again to please take time to think things through before jumping into them. You'll find yourself getting in less trouble as a result. Trust me in this?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, right. I'll think about thinking about things, okay?", "input": "", "output": "That's all I ask. Next week then. See you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. How are you doing this week?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm the one that's going to say, \"I told you so.\"", "input": "", "output": "About what?"}, {"instruction": "My mom, the bitch. I knew it wouldn't last with her, I just knew it. She's back to her old self again, but this time it's probably more my fault than I want to admit, you know? It's like, \"Bite me, spank me, whatever!\"", "input": "", "output": "You're having problems with your mother again?"}, {"instruction": "Duh, that's what I'm trying to tell you. Yes, I'm having problems with her. \"Problems\" is a generous word, as far as she's concerned. She really knows when to stir up the shit pan, too. The other night, Friday night, I brought Luke over there. It was only his second time there and probably his last, but I'm getting sidetracked. What was I telling you about? Oh yeah, my mom. So anyway, we were having this nice dinner. She was being too quiet. I noticed that Mark and I were doing most of the talking. After dinner, I decided to help with the dishes and stuff. She was in the kitchen, pounding and slamming things down. Her jaw was all clenched tight, but she wasn't saying a word to me. Well, I knew the time had come, finally--she was ready to blow any minute. So I just said, \"Out with it, mom.\"", "input": "", "output": "What did she do?"}, {"instruction": "What didn't she do or say? She said, \"I'm damn mad at you!\" And she was going off loud enough for everyone in the other room to hear. She told me she was angry about the shoplifting. It turned out that she knew the lady at that particular shop, so I embarrassed her. And she was pissed because she was certain that I'm doing drugs, remember?  At the trial? Well, she remembered. Yeah, you remember and so did she. Everything I said on the stand at Benny's trial came back to haunt me, thanks to my mother. She accused me of doing speed. And I was like, \"No way!\" But of course, as usual, she didn't believe me. Then she went on to tell me that she wasn't about to sign any papers that will allow me to graduate from school early--it turned out that I have enough credits to graduate right now. And even though Mark wanted me to live there with them, that wasn't necessarily what she wanted.", "input": "", "output": "How did you respond?"}, {"instruction": "Not good. I raised my voice back at her. And before I knew it, she brought her hand up to slap me in the face. Can you believe that? She was going to slap me! But I put my hand up and caught hers in time. And that's when Mark came in, just at the right moment to see me with her wrist in my hand.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was wonderful, just wonderful! I was all like totally out of there, you know? Luke and I just got up and left. But that wasn't even the best part of all this. There was a whole lot more.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "So here were Luke and my sisters and Mark all out in the dining room, listening to every word, because we were yelling. And so now, Luke knows about the shoplifting, I didn't mention that to him before then. He was all cool, kind of quiet, but I thought that he was maybe stunned or something--he never saw my mom and me fight before, I don't think. So he told me that he was thinking that maybe we ought to have a trial separation. And I was like, \"What?\" He said that he needs some space right now. I was all, \"Okay, but where did this come from all of a sudden?\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You know, I was wondering what was wrong. But we hadn't even had a fight or anything. So he asked me when I was planning to tell him about the shoplifting. And I was like, \"What can I say,\" you know? What could I say to him? Then he went on about the S&M and all that. Oh, and I forgot. While my mom and I were fighting, the baby started screaming. He wanted to join in I guess. And my mom was like, \"Look what you've done now! You made him cry!\" That bitch really hates me, you know? Well, sometimes I just hate her, too.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, take a moment now and breathe in deep and slow. Yes, like that. There, much better. Good. You were going pretty fast there for a minute, I was afraid you might hyperventilate."}, {"instruction": "I think I did hyperventilate the other day. We were in Santa Cruz, Tony and I, and Regina and Cami came along, too. Luke was going to go, but he dumped me or something.  Anyway, we got stoned before climbing aboard the Giant Dipper, and we rode that damned thing seventeen times or something like that. That thing was spinning my brains all around. And I was all in my head about all this shit. And when we got off, all of a sudden, everything was going dark on me and I couldn't breathe. Tony said I started to turn blue before he punched a quick and hard blow to my chest, and then I came out of it. I was pretty shaky for a while after that. Later, we headed down the pier and ate at this fish place. And then we watched the sunset with all those high dusty clouds turning all purple and pink and orange. It was so cool! But, dude, when I blacked out...I was so scared.", "input": "", "output": "Have you had anything like that happen to you before?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think so. Once or twice maybe. Why?", "input": "", "output": "When was the last time before the Santa Cruz incident?"}, {"instruction": "You know, I do remember the last time very vividly. It was the first night after I did my testimony at Benny's trial. I was standing there painting--and it was the same thing except I was alone--and the next thing I knew, I was eating the linoleum. It was too weird. And I was real shaky after that, too. So anyway, yeah...Luke broke up with me. And the funny thing is maybe it hasn't really hit me yet. I don't think I'm feeling the way I'm suppose to feel about it. Does that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "Maybe the reality of the break up hasn't hit you yet. Did you say he only wanted a trial separation? Have you really broken up?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't get that far yet. He was telling me all these things--especially things about the S&M--that he doesn't like. And he refused completely to even try to understand. He thought it was a sick thing to do, and he didn't understand how I could let someone do that to me, let alone a girl, a lesbian. Well, that didn't hit me quite the way he intended it to. I was pretty damn offended by it, you know? I was like, \"Okay, so now we're getting down to the bottom of all this.\" He's homophobic, is that the right word for it? He doesn't like lesbiterians. And you know what else? I don't think he really accepts his own homosexual nature. You know that?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So here we were standing out in front of my mom's house, and I was all freaking and getting more and more upset. And he just stormed off. Just like that, he walked away. And that was last Friday night, and I haven't heard from him since. I don't plan to call him. Fuck him! I really...I don't need his shit anyway. He can...well, it's...uh, it's his loss, you know?", "input": "", "output": "You are feeling really bad about this."}, {"instruction": "Huh? Isn't that what I've been telling you all along? Earth to Doctor Balis! Earth to Doctor Balis! It's not like I'm all out there, busting out, running wild and free in the sunshine, all happy. It's fucked up, you know? It totally blows. What a mess all of a sudden. It's like...it's, uh...well, I don't know. I just don't know anymore. I haven't been sleeping well at all, and I'm not very hungry.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "I'm not done with the story. Yes, there's more. After all that with Luke, I was so upset that I walked over to Regina's house. I knew she'd be home because she lives with her dad and he's kind of old and needs someone there at night in case he falls or something. He's sick and stuff. So I went over there, and I was trying not to cry in front of her. I hate crying. And she saw all over my face that something was wrong. Her dad was all passed out, so we went down to the garage to burn some.", "input": "", "output": "To smoke marijuana?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, to burn a little. We were down there talking and smoking, and all of a sudden, the door slammed open and her father was standing there pointing his finger at me and yelling, \"I can smell that shit you're giving to my daughter! I don't want this boy in my house ever again! Get him out of here!\" And he tried to come down the stairs. And Regina ran up to stop him. And I was all...I was just standing there frozen, not knowing what I should do. And he kept yelling, \"Goddamn little son-of-a-bitch, corrupting my daughter!\" And she was pushing him back into the house. And I was thinking if he only knew. It wasn't even my dope, it was hers! I can't win. I was corrupting her! Can you really believe that?", "input": "", "output": "You had a rough week."}, {"instruction": "To put it mildly. Very mildly! Now I am faced with this old fart hating me for nothing, but hating me just the same. Then, late that night, like at two in the morning, Regina came knocking on my bedroom window. She decided to run out of there.", "input": "", "output": "She ran away from home?"}, {"instruction": "You can say that. She just took off. I guess she had had enough already. So now, she is sleeping in the studio at night.", "input": "", "output": "Does Ralph know that?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Alex?"}, {"instruction": "He knows now, he didn't the first night. But I knew I couldn't keep something like that from him. He'd shit in his pants--which is nearly what I did when her father came careening down into the garage. So Ralph's cool with it so long as it's a temporary thing. She is making arrangements to go with Cami. But Cami is staying with some other people...oh, it's all so complicated. My life is such a mess.", "input": "", "output": "I know it seems that way now, but things will settle down. Alex, how much marijuana are you smoking these days?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? Why? I mean, I'm not a pot head.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm sure you don't think so. But you told me that you smoke regularly before you paint, you smoked in Regina's father's garage, and you were smoking before the roller coaster ride. I'm concerned that your smoking is getting out of hand, Alex. With everything else going on in your life, the marijuana only inhibits your ability to cope. Have you realized that your life seems to be out of hand lately?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, so?", "input": "", "output": "I worry when you tell me that you are hyperventilating. It sounds like classic symptoms of severe anxiety. Now, if the anxiety was something occurring of its own accord and if you weren't smoking marijuana, I would be able to treat it. But smoking dope only exacerbates the situation. It breaks down your judgment, directly inhibiting your coping ability."}, {"instruction": "Uh huh, right. You just want me to stop smoking it.", "input": "", "output": "Of course I do.  But I think the reasons are obvious and I just laid them out for you."}, {"instruction": "Are you saying that pot is the cause of all my problems? You have got to be kidding!", "input": "", "output": "No, it's not the trigger, but it is making things worse. You seem really on edge these past few weeks, and I don't need to point out the trouble you have been in lately. Alex, your judgment is off. I think that this has something to do with your unresolved feelings about Benny, the trial, and Joe.  You're trying to numb yourself into not feeling any pain, but that's a dangerous alternative to doing what we do here together.  I know that talking it out is hard, but it works.  Covering up your pain with drugs never works."}, {"instruction": "It's...uh...it's...why do you do that? So what if Benny is on my mind sometimes...no, all the time. So fucking what? And who cares if Joe is still in the back of my mind? The past is the past, and I don't ever want to dwell on it, see?", "input": "", "output": "I understand that, Alex. But this is what we are here for. We are here to work through your problems. And you are using marijuana to escape from them."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, I don't appreciate you bringing up...oh well, you kind of hit the nail square on, you know that? I don't know how you do that, you must be psychic or something. That stuff is always there in my head. I don't know. What do I do?", "input": "", "output": "Take some time to think about things."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess I can do that.", "input": "", "output": "Now, we've run out of time, Alex. Take care, and I'll see you next week. And if you need to talk to me sooner, just give me a call and we can work it out, okay?"}, {"instruction": "All right. Well, thanks, dude.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. Well, it's official!", "input": "", "output": "Pardon me?"}, {"instruction": "It's Luke, he's missing.", "input": "", "output": "Missing?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you heard me. And it's all my fault, too.", "input": "", "output": "Why would you be responsible for his disappearance?"}, {"instruction": "Well...uh, after he broke up with me and walked away like he did, I felt...uh,I felt like shit, I guess. I felt like total shit. And all I could say was: \"His loss!\" It was like it didn't really matter. But it did, you know? It mattered a lot, more than I let him know. But it was a matter of principle, you know? It was because of his closed-mindedness about what I was doing with Cami and stuff. And he was so pissed after hearing about the shoplifting--my mother's yelling and all. But...I don't know. He was all totally freaked, and I wasn't going to put up with it anymore. I'd just had enough. But now...what were we supposed to be talking about?", "input": "", "output": "Luke. You said he was missing. What's going on?"}, {"instruction": "That's right, I was just leading up to that. So anyway, I was pretty upset about it--the way he just ran off like that. I didn't believe he would stay gone. I figured that I would hear from him, at least over the phone, you know? But he didn't call; he didn't come by. Nothing. The next couple of nights, I couldn't really sleep or even think straight, all I could think about was Luke. So finally, he phoned. But I--being the stubborn ass that I am--didn't take his calls. Jeez, what's up with that? I didn't know what to say or how to handle things. I just knew that I would go off or something. Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah. Anyway, Monday came and went. Then Tuesday and Wednesday, and still there were no more calls and no Luke. I was certain that it was over with him by then, I even told you so last week. But now, and especially then, I was feeling confused and rejected, like I was to blame. And, of course, I am to blame. But I didn't see things that way until...uh, until he disappeared.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think he has disappeared?"}, {"instruction": "Because he has...Jeez! It's all my fault, too. I caused him to go off like that. I...uh, I mean...finally, I did it. I really did it this time! I totally fucked things up.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, look at me. Now, take a deep breath and focus on the moment. Good. Better. Okay, so why are you blaming yourself? Take it slow, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. It's just...uh, it's fucked me all up, you know? Oh shit, here I go again.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. Here. Here are the tissues. Do you want some water?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that would be good. Thanks. But...where were we? Sorry, I keep doing that.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, are you under the influence right now?"}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "Did you smoke marijuana before you came here?"}, {"instruction": "Uh? No! Shit. Why do you always think the worst of me? Jeez! I'm really having a rough time here, okay? I'm trying to tell you what happened, and you think I'm stoned? No, I am not stoned, dude. Okay?", "input": "", "output": "All right, I'm sorry, Alex. Please, go on."}, {"instruction": "So last Thursday afternoon after school, Cami came over and played model for me while I tried to paint her. She and I get along great, we really like each other. It's like we have this great chemistry or something. So, she and I were getting all playful with each other, and before I know it, we were on the floor of the studio wrestling. Well, I don't know what came over me, or her, but...well, we started to get undressed. And I think if Luke hadn't come in at that moment, we might have...uh, we would have...uh, done it, you know?", "input": "", "output": "You would have had sex with Cami?"}, {"instruction": "You know, one thing I have always said about you is that you're about as sharp as a meatball sometimes. Duh, yes. We would have had sex, is that so weird? I thought so, because it was weird for me. Here I was thinking that I was going to do it with Cami. And she wanted to do it with me, too, I could see that much. At that moment, it wasn't at all like the same confusion it turned into afterward.", "input": "", "output": "But Luke walked in on you."}, {"instruction": "Shit, yes. He did. It was so ugly, too. He came in on us, unannounced of course, and he just grabbed the easel and threw it over. And then he swiped his arm across my paints, causing them to fall all over the floor--what a mess! He started screaming at me: \"Fuck you! Fuck you! I hate you! I hate you!\" And he ran out of there like a storm just hit. And I was pulling my pants on trying to catch up with him, but he got to his car and sped off like a bat out of hell before I even had a chance.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Cami and I were just blown away by this. We were kind of in a state of shock. At least I was in a state of shock, she was thunderstruck speechless. I don't know if we were more shocked over what was coming down between her and me, or if we were blown away by Luke's little display. It was all so weird. We looked at each other square in the eyes for ten minutes probably, and we didn't say a word. We didn't know what to do, so we got into her car and drove over to Luke's condo. He wasn't there. Then we went back to the house and called a few places he likes to go, but no one had seen him. There was no word until Saturday; that's when I got a call from Beylund. Remember him? He's the photographer.", "input": "", "output": "I think I remember."}, {"instruction": "Luke was supposed to start this big job on Saturday, but he didn't show up. He never misses an appointment and is hardly ever late. So that was pretty weird. Beylund was asking me where Luke was and I didn't know. I went over to Luke's again. This time, his mail piled up and his cat was in the window going crazy, pacing back and forth and meowing because he could see me outside. My heart was totally up in my throat. I knew something wasn't right, this was so not like him.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Did anyone file a police report?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's why Saturday was so important. Saturday afternoon they found his car parked and locked over at Baker Beach.", "input": "", "output": "Who found the car? How did you find out about it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I went back and called Beylund and told him what I saw at the condo. He told me that while I was there, the police called him and told him about the car. I guess they found Beylund's number in the car or something, I don't really know how he got involved. But anyway, I was thinking all this bizarre shit--about ax murderers, and chainsaws, and shit like that, you know? I was really scared. I still am. And now five days later, and still no word. I called his dad's house, there was no one there. I went back to Luke's place every day and there was no sign of him. At least the property manager got into his unit and was taking care of Luke's cat. And then I got the bright idea of opening his mail.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, I did it. And I'd open your mail, too, if something like this happened with you. There is a lot of important information on credit card bills and phone bills. That's how I got his sister's number in LA, but she wasn't home either. I couldn't get a hold of anyone who knew anything.", "input": "", "output": "I have to say that Luke's disappearance does concern me."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, Luke is gone and it really is all my fault. If I hadn't been playing around with Cami in the first place, this never would have happened. This is the worst thing that could possibly happen. There's got to be a reasonable explanation. There just has to be. I don't know what I'd do if something bad happened to him. If he were here right now, I'd know what to do to make everything all right again. I'd...well, I'd just...uh, this is all just too much to deal with.", "input": "", "output": "I understand how you must feel, Alex. Here, drink some more water. I don't know what happened to Luke. You said that he drove away from your studio angry. What happened between then and the time his car was found was beyond your control..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but if I hadn't been there naked with Cami close to having sex with her when he walked in, he wouldn't have gotten so freaked and ran off like that.", "input": "", "output": "I agree. You were caught by your boyfriend trying to initiate sex with a woman. That's not good. Luke had every reason to be upset. But if he went off and tried to do something that would put him in danger or if he tried to..."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't have any time now to be thinking about what happened to him. I'm going to start doing my community labor now. Last Friday, we had the hearing and I was ordered to do eleven hundred and twenty hours of community labor. This works out to be one hundred and twenty hours for every dollar that stupid radio was worth. Can you believe it? That's about a penny an hour.  Pretty stupid, huh? And all this came down before I knew Luke was gone. So anyway, they ordered me to work with SLUG, have you heard of them?", "input": "", "output": "SLUG? Can't say I have. What is it?"}, {"instruction": "San Francisco League of Urban Gardeners. They have these little plots all over the city. You must have seen them. There are little undeveloped lots in the middle of a neighborhood, and they are being rented out to people who want to garden in them. Usually, the lots are subdivided into small parcels, so several people can use the space at once. My job has something to do with that, I'm not sure what exactly. So that's what I'm supposed to be doing on Saturdays now for eight hours a day. The only bright spot in all this is that my time at the Alliance will count towards the total--which is very cool--but the only time I'll have for the Alliance from now on will be on weeknights. Oh, and they got rid of the ankle bracelet thing, too. See?", "input": "", "output": "I think this is all very reasonable considering your crime."}, {"instruction": "Well, we'll see how reasonable it is. I have to be at the job site no later than eight in the morning. Next Saturday, I have to go over to Bernal Hill. That's like all the way across town. I'm going to have to leave the house by seven in the morning or something. Now, if I can get to sleep and not wake up from a nightmare the night before, I might be able to get a lot done. But...", "input": "", "output": "Are you still having trouble sleeping?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, I have no trouble falling to sleep.

Big, and deep, and scary nightmares.", "input": "", "output": "Do you remember what they are about?"}, {"instruction": "Well, these past few nights, it has been a mixture of Luke and Benny and shit--Luke sometimes morphs into Benny, and then Benny into Joe. And once, I even remember Jimmy in there somewhere. Oh! And there has also been some stuff about Cami, too. None of it makes any sense. Well, the faces all make sense, and we both know why they're there. I'm so weirded out about what happened between Cami and me, Doc. And I bet she is too. And we've been avoiding each other as much as possible. I don't know. So much shit has come down since those two--Regina and Cami--came into my life. I'm not sure which one is worse: Regina, the dope fiend, or Cami, the whip-carrying sex kitten. Fuck! I'm so damned confused, and I wish to God that I knew where Luke was. He's got to be okay. He's just got to.", "input": "", "output": "We can only hope for the best, Alex."}, {"instruction": "We're out of time, aren't we?", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid we are. I'll see you again next week."}, {"instruction": "All right. Well, later, dude.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex. And please let me know if you hear something about Luke."}, {"instruction": "I'll try. Shit, I'm going over to church, and I'll light a candle for him. See you, man.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Alex. Call me if you need to. I'm here for you."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Well, we found him.", "input": "", "output": "Luke?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but that hasn't really changed a lot between us.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. He doesn't seem to understand anything that went on between me and Cami. He won't even try to understand. And I'm not sure even I understand what was happening between her and me. I'm kind of feeling really embarrassed by the whole thing, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What is it that you are embarrassed by?"}, {"instruction": "It's hard to explain. Luke was in Carmel. His dad had a heart attack and ended up in the hospital. That's why I couldn't find him. He turned up last week. Last Thursday, I called his dad's house, and Luke picked up the phone. I was speechless when I heard his voice, and I asked him what he was doing there. Well, he didn't even realize that the San Francisco police department thought he was a missing person--he didn't show up for his job, and his car was abandoned and then towed from such a remote place. I mean you don't just leave your car like that, you know? You call people to let them know, so they don't worry about you.", "input": "", "output": "What was Luke's explanation?"}, {"instruction": "I told you already, his dad had a heart attack. Before Luke knew about his dad and after he walked in on Cami and me, he went over to Baker Beach and his car broke down. He got a ride back from someone--a stranger, I guess. When he got back to his condo, he got the call for his dad and then took a bus down to Carmel. I was mad that he didn't call anybody to tell them where he was. But he said he wasn't thinking about anything else but his father, not to mention that he was mad at me anyway. So almost an entire week passed before anyone heard anything about him, and he couldn't understand what the big deal was. And I was bent over all of this; it was making me crazy. I was calling his dad's house every day; I knew someone would answer at some point. But still, things are different between us now.  Forever maybe. They're definitely different and strange.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, they just are, believe me. This thing with Cami and me has really twisted me all up, you know? What was I thinking? It's like...does this mean I'm not gay? Am I straight or what? What's up with all that? It's been real confusing for me. It's like on one hand, Cami and I have this certain chemistry thing going on and all that, you know? Then my relationship with Luke is pretty much over because of my stupidity and because I didn't pay attention to what I was doing. So much for self-anesthetizing with pot--I became so stupid with that shit, you know? I totally blow it with Luke and with Cami, too. And it was all such perfect timing, too. First, my mom spills the beans about the shoplifting. And then...", "input": "", "output": "Actually, Luke's issues with S&M dated quite far back."}, {"instruction": "Oh, thank you very much, dude! Okay, so you're right. First, I was stupid because I was doing S&M and Cami, even though I really had a lot of fun with that. I think that's the main thing that Luke was jealous about. Then, he didn't like the fact that I was smoking dope so much--and we were smoking a lot, if I do say so myself, but I already knew that and you did, too. But what really changed things for him was when he walked in on her and me doing...that's what I think has permanently damaged things for us. And I don't understand that part myself. I thought I was pretty secure in the idea that I was gay. Now, how do I know if I'm not straight or something?", "input": "", "output": "I can understand your doubts and confusion about your sexual preference right now. But some people are attracted to both sexes."}, {"instruction": "Oh, no. That's even more confusing! You mean I'm bi? Well, I don't know. It's not like I'm suddenly attracted to all women or anything like that. I told Katherine about it, and she seemed to know just what to say. She told me that she knew some guy in high school who dated and had sex with girls and then later turned out to be gay. This really isn't the same thing, but it's close. And other people who have been with both men and women, at the same time even...I hadn't even thought about this before. How totally naive can I be? I'm sure people have three-way sex all the time, but that's not anything I am into. I am so grossed out by what we did. And I can't even think about what's going through Cami's mind. And why am I tripping about this so much? I'm never going back to that again, no way!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, it is important to understand that people can become sexually aroused by a wide variety of things. Some people are constantly attracted to both sexes, some people alternate, going back and forth, while others stick to one. There's a wide diversity in the things that turn people on. There's as much variety in sexual attraction as there are in people generally. I know how confusing it all seems right now. You need more time to go over this in your mind, don't try to figure it all out at once. And you have other issues to deal with as well."}, {"instruction": "Well, since Luke is not going to be around for a while, I'm going to stay away from sex with anyone for now, too. I don't need to be all confused like this; I have enough else going on these days.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I think abstinence might be a good idea. Alex, you have major issues surrounding Benny and Joe that haven't been resolved yet. These issues effect every aspect of your day to day life. I really think it would do you a lot of good to work those things out here, with me."}, {"instruction": "But I told you already. I don't want to keep reliving the past! Shit! Oh, great! Here it comes. Thanks a lot, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Here, Alex, here's a tissue."}, {"instruction": "Fuck! See what you made me do? See? It's not like I really need this shit right now.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. These are very strong emotions, and they have been bubbling under the surface for quite some time now."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know. It's just...it's...damn it! It's real hard to think about this, okay? It's...well, it's...uh, with Benny...well, the fucker just used me, you know? He just took what he needed and left me hanging. The Joe thing wasn't something that I always put a lot of importance on. I don't know why, but even so...when something...anything comes near my throat, I just turn to stone. It's only when I think about the knife, that I feel something deep inside of me. Other than holding the knife to my throat, what he did to me was very little. But the idea of any sex, any at all, makes me want to hurl my guts out right here.", "input": "", "output": "I'd appreciate if you didn't."}, {"instruction": "I know, it wouldn't be pretty! So, uh...what do I have to do, Doctor? What do I do to exorcise these demons inside me?", "input": "", "output": "Keep talking about it. Keep letting your real feelings out. Every little bit will help release some of the pressure you may feel. Get support--good, healthy support. You mentioned Katherine, she's always been a good friend."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. But...", "input": "", "output": "But what?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she's always pretty busy these days. She's into everything. There was that big thing that was going on over at SII. And now, there's the Arts Alliance. And she's up to some other things, too. It's been hard to pin her down lately, you know?", "input": "", "output": "But when you do catch up to her, she's a good supportive friend. I encourage you to get the support you need. How about writing your thoughts down?"}, {"instruction": "Oh no, here we go again. Do you know how many times you have asked me to do that?", "input": "", "output": "And I'm asking you again. It doesn't have to be perfect or follow any guidelines. You don't even have to show it to anyone. Just write things down as they come up, to get them out of your system. Writing can be very cathartic. It's surprising sometimes."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. I do write sometimes, I always have. It's just that I don't do it regularly. I guess I could try. In the meantime, I guess I'm going to have to face Camille. I don't know what to say to her. I saw Regina already, and I know by the way she acted that she didn't know what had happened.", "input": "", "output": "How could you tell?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she would have ripped my eyeballs out or something. She's totally in love with Cami. I hope she doesn't find out about it.", "input": "", "output": "So Regina isn't staying at Ralph's anymore?"}, {"instruction": "At Ralph's? Oh, yeah. That was just for a couple of days. She's back with her dad now. I almost forgot about that. No, that didn't last long. And if she had been staying there, the thing between Cami and me wouldn't have ever happened. Anyway, I'm not smoking any dope right now, maybe never again, I don't know. I thought you'd be happy to hear that.", "input": "", "output": "I think it's a positive step, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Regina couldn't believe that I said no to pot, but I did. Somehow, I got to figure out a way to make up with Luke, maybe not necessarily get back together, just make things right between us. I don't want either of us to have any bad feelings towards each other. It's real important to me that he doesn't hold onto any bad feelings. I don't want to be the reason he becomes jaded or anything.", "input": "", "output": "That's good, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah? We'll see if I can make that happen. Oh, by the way, I started my labor work bullshit last weekend.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it was hard work. Look at my hands. I even got some calluses. They had me and these other two jerks clearing out weeds and brush, and building little retaining walls, and shit like that. And on Saturday, the weather was psychotic--hot and sunny and cool and cloudy, back and forth. I was sweating like a pig out there. I was wiped out. But later that evening, I finally saw Katherine, and we were able to talk. I don't know how she does it. She made me see things--the shit I was doing and stuff like that--in a different way. She talks to me like no other adult does, that's why I like her so much. She has a way with words and ideas. And you're right, she really is a good friend. She could be a good role model for someone like my mother, you know? Oh yeah, speaking of her, the wedding is coming up at the end of the month. You should come. It's guaranteed to be the event of the year, I'm sure. If nothing else, she and I might be getting along by then, and that would be an event in itself!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, we're almost out of time. I'd like you to think about writing some of your thoughts down. And, Alex, I'm proud of you for seeing what chronic pot smoking was doing to you."}, {"instruction": "Never say never, Doc! I didn't say that I didn't like it. I just said I wasn't doing it right now.", "input": "", "output": "That's a step in the right direction. Take care, Alex. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Later on, dude.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Good, I guess. I don't know. I have a lot on my mind.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it seems that the girls are drifting out of my life. I'm not sure, but it seems that way now. I did see Regina the other day, and she's onto us. She doesn't know what she's onto, but she knows something came down between Camille and me. She didn't come right out and say so, but I could tell that she was wondering what it was. I felt like she was going to blurt out a question or something. I told her that I had found Luke. You know I haven't even seen Cami, and she doesn't know that Luke's okay. She is totally avoiding me. And I guess I'm avoiding her too, still.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So while I was doing my slug-work on Saturday, Cami was at the Alliance. This means we miss each other there now. And I just know that as soon as Regina figures things out, that she'll try to maim or kill me.", "input": "", "output": "You don't really think..."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, I do think she will! Definitely, she will. She's the crazy one, remember? She's the one who wanted to go out and find a straight couple and beat the shit out of them. And I think she would do something like that, I really do. But, like...I'm going to be okay, because she's going to have to catch me off guard.", "input": "", "output": "Like climb through your bedroom window?"}, {"instruction": "Dude! I completely forgot about that. She did that one time, didn't she? Hmm...", "input": "", "output": "You can get that lock fixed."}, {"instruction": "Or maybe I'll just lock the damned thing. Thanks, dude. I don't know what I would've done without you.", "input": "", "output": "Well, you seem to be feeling better. You look rested."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess I feel pretty well rested. I've really been thinking about stuff, about everything. And I've realized how out of control it must have seemed I was getting.", "input": "", "output": "I think you were really pushing the envelope there, even for you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess I was. Do you know what got me to thinking? Did you hear about that car accident up in Santa Rosa last week? Two kids--my age or maybe older, I don't know--were driving while under the influence of pot, and the car went out of control. They ended up in more than serious condition. One of them lost an arm. It really made me think. I was doing that, too. But I wasn't speeding. I don't know anybody who would be able to speed after burning one, you know? And then, there was another accident on Friday night, I think, here in The City. Two or three teenagers crushed, one of them is dead. Now that's even more serious. It really made me sit up and pay attention, I'm telling you.", "input": "", "output": "I can see how sobering these incidents are for you."}, {"instruction": "Sobering, yeah, really. I don't know. It's just...it's kind of like it was supposed to happen this way for me. I don't know. I'm not making any sense, am I?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you are. Go on."}, {"instruction": "Well, I had this long talk with Tony. He was supposed to be staying sober, too. He goes to some rehab meeting thing twice a week, and he's supposed to be sober. That was the whole point. But he thinks pot isn't a drug or something. Anyway, we talked about what happened between Cami and me, and he totally laughed about it. He said this kind of thing is more common than I might think--this crossing over thing. Especially in S&M, people trade off from one sex to the other. Well, I told him that it's all too confusing for me. I don't need the bull that comes with crossing over. And do you know what he said then? He said my problem is that I'm all wrapped up in this need to be the tough guy or something and that I wasn't paying attention to what really matters.", "input": "", "output": "And what does Tony think really matters?"}, {"instruction": "Well that's the interesting part. Tony couldn't say what really matters, but I got an answer anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It came from Roly, of all people.", "input": "", "output": "Roly? You haven't mentioned him in a while."}, {"instruction": "I know. But he hasn't visited me lately. Well, last weekend, he did, and I think he has made his point now.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "I dreamt that he and I were walking in this thick, dark forest. It was very primeval with all these thick, twisted trees with dark limbs and bark. It was like the Wizard of Oz or something. There was a paved road, and for some reason I thought it was yellow or gold. I had watched the Wizard of Oz on TV with Racyl and Rhea over at my mom's on Friday night. She and Mark went out and even left Aaron with the three of us. Anyway, where was I?", "input": "", "output": "In the forest with Roly."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, thanks. So we were walking, and it really was like the movie. We had all these things happen, bad things, things we had to fight to get out of. It really felt like I was there, doing all that stuff with him. It felt like it lasted for days and days, you know? Oh yeah, and there was a wicked witch, too. Guess who that was?", "input": "", "output": "Must I?"}, {"instruction": "You don't even have to guess for that one. My mom, of course. Ha! Ha! Can you believe it? So perfect! But anyway, we came to this point--it was just before I woke up--and he told me, totally serious and deep-like while looking me straight in the eye: \"Don't let yourself be controlled by other people, follow your own heart.\" It was something like that. But it really hit me, you know? It was like he made me wake up, literally.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about it?"}, {"instruction": "Like I said, it made me wake up. At first, I thought he was talking about S&M. But then I realized that S&M is about being in control and about trusting enough in the other person to also be able to give your control away. But now more than ever, I think that what he really meant was that I need to be less swayed by other people, be less reactive to them, or be less influenced by others. Does that make any sense?", "input": "", "output": "It makes sense, Alex. And I agree."}, {"instruction": "It won't be all that long before I turn eighteen, and then I can do anything I want. But...", "input": "", "output": "But what?"}, {"instruction": "But by then, I will be legally responsible for all of it, too. It's not that I'm not responsible for my actions now, but it will be different. The courts treat you different when you're eighteen. So, whatever. All this has really got me thinking about things, about what I want to do with my life and my times.", "input": "", "output": "And what conclusions have you come to?"}, {"instruction": "It's hard to say exactly what conclusions I've come to, if any, really. I realize that now is the time for me to begin to concentrate on my life, on what I want to do when I grow up.", "input": "", "output": "What do you want to do?"}, {"instruction": "I want to paint. I want to design and create things. Do you know what I really truly want? I want to be a part of the theater or something like that. I went to see \"The Phantom of the Opera\" a few months ago and \"Swan Lake\" the other night. And I've seen a couple of other things, too--\"My Castle's Rockin' \" at Theater Rhinoceros. I'm entranced by the whole production part of it: the stage sets, the way the sheer drapes hang over the ballroom in \"Swan Lake,\" the way the chandelier comes crashing down in \"The Phantom.\" I'm interested in how it all works. I was even fascinated by the whole production of the Macy's Passport show last year, where I met Luke. Oh great! I had to go and say his name, great! It kind of spoiled the moment.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I've been talking to him, or more accurately, he's been talking to me, but we're not back together yet. And I'm not real happy about the way things are going between us. It's not all bad, I guess, but...", "input": "", "output": "What's happening?"}, {"instruction": "He and I spent the day together on Sunday. We really needed to talk, and I persuaded him to come out with me. We went down the coast to the Moss Beach. Have you ever been to the tide pools there? They are so frigging cool! You've got to go if you haven't been there. There are all these huge tide-pools, and all this sea life in them, shells and starfish in every color imaginable, and all different kind of birds, and...where were we? Oh yeah, Luke. Well, we walked all up and down that beach along the tide pools, and we talked and talked. It seemed like we were getting nowhere mostly. The one thing that stood out the most was his comment about Cami.", "input": "", "output": "What did he say about her?"}, {"instruction": "He said that I was totally under her spell. And I was like, \"Who wouldn't be?\" She is beautiful, like Cindy Crawford beautiful, and approachable like that...you know? I bet even you would do anything for someone like Cami. Even I think she's pretty hot, and I'm gay. I mean what do I know? But he was like, \"You're totally under her magic.\" And I was all, \"Yes, I am under her spell.\" But I told him that was too simple. It felt almost like we were blaming her for everything that happened, but I was as much a part of it as she was, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Very insightful. Since you've stopped smoking marijuana, there has been more clarity in your thoughts. Am I right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I mean, no. I mean...uh, I mean, yes. And since I've stopped, my dreams have been incredibly vivid, like the one I just told you about in full color, the works, you know? This is almost more of a trip than being stoned. But with Luke, I just don't know where any of it is leading. It doesn't seem like we are getting back together, it's just a bunch of talking, around and around, same old, same old.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it sounds better than nothing at all. At least you are communicating. If nothing else, you'll be able to put a more positive closure on your relationship. That's better than what many people get."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. I guess I should be grateful or something, grateful that at least he's talking to me. He could be an ass about things and totally shut me out, but he's not. So, you're right, it's better than nothing. Luke really is a good guy. I hope we can work things out.", "input": "", "output": "I hope so, too, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Well, I hope for the best, but expect the worst. If I try to look at it any other way, I think I may go crazy...again. I know, I know. You head doctors don't like to use that term, uh?", "input": "", "output": "No, there's nothing wrong with anything you've said; I understand your context. Well, I'm afraid we've run out of time. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, all right. I'll catch you then, dude.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex, and take care."}, {"instruction": "Dude!", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. You look well. How are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's been one of those weeks. I have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming.", "input": "", "output": "What's been going on?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm...where do I start? A lot has been going on. First, let's start with Regina. She screwed me, big time. Yeah, she figured it all out. I guess she must have gotten Cami to talk, I don't know. But she ended up screwing herself, too. So it was worth the trouble she caused me.", "input": "", "output": "What did she do?"}, {"instruction": "It all started as an outing, I guess. We were going out; she wanted to talk. Well, before I knew it, we had been driving for a while. I didn't know where she was taking me, but all of a sudden she started screaming at me: \"You are not my friend anymore, how could you do this to me, to Cami, to us.\" It was all things like that. She knew what happened between Cami and me. So I figured she got Cami to spill, you know? Before I could even try to defend myself, she pulled the car over and said, \"Get out.\" I was all, \"Wait. No. I don't have any way to get back to the City.\" And she went, \"That's your problem. You're not my friend, you're not Cami's friend, either. You aren't welcome in my house or in my life. Out!\" Then she reached over to me--I thought she was going to hit me--opened my door, and sort of pushed me to get out.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I got out. I just climbed out of the car and stood there while she peeled off, leaving me to breathe the dust cloud she left behind. So I was standing there, thinking: \"Now what?\" And then I realized that I was holding onto her little pouch thing--that's where she keeps her money, her dope, and her driver's license. Anyway, I had it in my hand, and she just left me there in the dirt. I had to laugh out loud; it was just too funny!", "input": "", "output": "How did you get home?"}, {"instruction": "She left me on one of those turnouts along Devil's Slide. Have you ever been there?", "input": "", "output": "I've gone that route when I drove to Half Moon Bay. That's a long walk home."}, {"instruction": "That's where she left me, the little bitch. But I had the last laugh, though. She didn't even think, she just acted. Sounds familiar? It's just like something I would do. Stupid, huh? So I dumped it all. I dumped everything but the cash, the cash I gave to this nice couple I met on the beach. I stood there paralyzed for a few minutes, and then I climbed down the rocks. I saw some people down there throwing a Frisbee. They were nude, and I wanted to get a closer look. I met these two guys--one young and one old, about your age I guess. They were lying in the sun and playing Frisbee and stuff. And that old dude just talked and talked, but it was interesting stuff. He just went on and on. They gave me a ride home. The old guy kept trying to hit on me. They were both gay, so we had a lot in common there. Yeah, that old dude was such a trip! The old pervert.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was an interesting experience, to put it mildly! Regina called me later to ask for her stuff back--that bitch has balls, you know? She tossed me out like that and then expected that I would keep her shit and give it back to her. Ha! I told her that, too. She got just what she dished.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm glad you were able to get a ride home safely."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. That was pretty nice of them. I stayed on the beach with them for a couple of hours; they even shared their food with me. I gave the younger guy my number, he gave me his business card. He owns some sort of candy shop on the Peninsula. Maybe we'll talk again, I don't know. Anyway, enough of that. So Luke did a complete turn around with me again, I can hardly believe it still.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if I want to overanalyze it, but basically he decided to forgive me. He came over to the house one night last week and told me that he was impressed by the concern I showed for him, by the way I got his landlord to get in and take care of his cat--he forgot about the cat. And he said he was surprised by my nerve to open his phone bill and get his sister's number and by all that stuff that went on after we thought he had disappeared. He said all this left an impression on him. He said it made him think about how much I cared about him. I told him about my horror show fantasies--the chain saws and switchblade fingernails I envisioned. He laughed so much. He said that he hadn't felt like laughing for some time, you know with his dad and all. But we sort of made up, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Congratulations. I think it's a good thing."}, {"instruction": "Well, for the most part, we are back together. We went out on Thursday night to The Box, and we danced until they closed it at six in the morning.

Did I mention that we didn't have sex?", "input": "", "output": "Are you trying to say that you had no sex?"}, {"instruction": "You're a funny guy! Yeah, we had no sex. Hey! That sounded like that stupid song, \"Yes, we have no bananas.\"", "input": "", "output": "Did you want to have sex?"}, {"instruction": "No! No! No! Remember?

I think you made a good choice for now, while you're sorting things out. I was thinking about your progress thus far. This is an important step for you, Alex. This is a very mature decision on your part."}, {"instruction": "Well...uh, hmm...yeah, you kind of left me with nothing to say. I'm sort of lost for words or something, I guess. Well, I did explain to Luke what was up with all that, and he wasn't into it either, right now. So it worked out for both of us just fine. But it wasn't like I didn't get turned on when he touched me, but...well, I don't need the...I don't know. I just don't need the bullshit that comes along with sex right now. Beyond and before Cami, the issue was Benny and Joe, but mostly Benny. You know, after I wrote him that letter a few months ago, I thought that I would see things differently, and I did. But it still haunts me, sort of.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about it."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It's just that I've been thinking about all the lies--lies that were made to Dora about what we were about, Benny and me. I get it all mixed up with the good stuff, the times we shared that were tender and the little day trips we used to take. I remember feeling mixed up most of the time.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me more about what it was that made you feel mixed up?"}, {"instruction": "Well, if he really truly cared about me, then why was he with her, having a baby? And why did he run me around like that, tricking me out? And I did it, too! How could he do those things? How could I have gone along with it all?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, this is going to sound a little harsh, perhaps, but I believe that Benny was a sociopath. He was a man who had the ability to live several lives. He was a skilled liar. He was married and apparently committed to his wife, Dora. But he also had a relationship of sorts with you and, perhaps, with a number of other children. I don't need to remind you of the young boy he abused. You were a child, Alex. You didn't know any better. Try to remember that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I know, but I don't know. And it bugs me, more often than not. It's always back there whispering in my ear or playing a little picture thing in my mind. Oh yeah! I told you he got sentenced, right?", "input": "", "output": "No, I don't think so. I'd been wondering what the outcome was."}, {"instruction": "Well, he didn't get very much time, as far as I'm concerned. He got only seven years. Can you believe that? And that's minus the time he spent in jail waiting for the trial to start. Plus, he could be out in three, maybe four years, if he lives that long. They don't like child molesters in prisons you know. I think he was sent to San Luis Obispo. So now, I'm over it--been there and done that, thank you very much! Fuck me! But when he gets out, no matter where he goes, he'll be a registered sex offender or a registered child molester, whatever. Either way, he'll get a scarlet letter pinned to his chest.", "input": "", "output": "Well, maybe this can be the beginning of the end of that chapter in your life."}, {"instruction": "I did feel sort of relieved when I heard he was sentenced. Oh well, it's time to move on. Have you ever heard of this thing? It's like a twelve-step program called Rational Recovery, I think?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, why do you ask?"}, {"instruction": "Are they legitimate?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, they are. Why are you asking about them?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's Tony. He goes to those meetings they have. I've been kind of worried about him. I think he might have a relapse. He's been smoking pot again--that's sort of my fault, you know. But since I've stopped smoking, he's been trying hard to convince me that smoking isn't using. He's supposed to be clean and sober. So I was thinking this Rational Recovery thing is bullshit. Is that what they do, rationalize smoking dope as opposed to snorting crank or something?", "input": "", "output": "I can assure you that Rational Recovery doesn't rationalize smoking marijuana as being somehow not drug use, Alex. It sounds to me like Tony might be in denial about his drug use. He's trying to trivialize it."}, {"instruction": "I'll say. He wants me to go to a meeting with him so I can see for myself what it's all about. I told him that he better stay away from that shit or I'd be out of there, you know? But maybe I'll join him for a meeting, what do you think?", "input": "", "output": "I think it's a good idea. That way you can see for yourself, and you may find it very interesting, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. We'll see. Oh, by the way, this Saturday is my mom's wedding. They're getting married at Saint Mary's on Cathedral Hill. The reception is at the California Culinary Academy. It's going to be quite a party--big and real fancy with relatives from all over. There'll be people I haven't ever met or knew existed. There'll be Mark's relatives, my cousins, and some older people, aunts and uncles, everyone. You ought to crash it, dude.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's not my style, Alex. It wouldn't be professional of me to be involved with my patients on that level."}, {"instruction": "You old stick! Oh well, you know where the action is going to be. Hey! My cousin Rosemarie will be there. I'd bet you and her would get along great. And she's pretty damn fine, too. It sort of runs in the family, you know.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Thanks, but I really must decline, Alex. Now, we're over our time. I'll see you again next week."}, {"instruction": "All right, dude. Talk to you later!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, man. My hand? Oh, it's only my thumb, really. I did it the night before the wedding. It hurts like a...I don't know, it just hurts! It seems to be throbbing all the time.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the night before the wedding, we had the rehearsal dinner for the wedding party...well for everyone, family too. Wow! There are people I'm related to that I've never even imagined existed: cousins, an uncle, a grandmother. I was totally blown away, I'm telling you. So, my hand...well, that was after the dinner. We took Mark out. Actually, we just had a party at the house of one of his friends. Mark and I were roughhousing--wrestling and stuff--and my thumb just kind of got crunched. We ended up in the emergency room for three hours that night, and we all had to get up early the next morning. My mom would have murdered every one of us if anything went wrong, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So anyway, what was I saying? We waited for three hours for the doctors to fix me up. It was a clean break, they said, and Mark's brother...uh, my uncle, his name is Cal, was telling me to hold on, trying to encourage me to keep my chin up, even though I was in total agony. So yeah. Well, what a trip, you know? I've never even thought about it--Mark has this whole family I've never met. I told you about his brother, Cal. And then there was their mother--my...uh, my grandmother, I guess. And there were all these cousins and stuff. I actually really truly have a family, a real family, can you believe it? Oh! But the big deal was what happened to my mom after the wedding, at the reception.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, even Katherine saw it, she mentioned something about it. I can't remember how she put it, but in a way that told me she saw it, too. She thought it was sweet or something, I don't know. My mom looked stunning, like she had never had a baby. She was so petite and all done up in that gown--my grandmother's antique Victorian thing, real pretty. Anyway, she really looked fantastic. Mark and she had been dancing for awhile, and then he came over and got me to get up and slow dance with my mother. And she clang to me tight and sort of hugged me. And when I looked down at her, she looked up and she was all crying. I don't know what hit her, but something in her eyes struck me. Normally, I wouldn't get all teary-eyed at something like that, but I did. Then, without saying a word, she grabbed my chin and planted a big wet one on my cheek. She hadn't done anything like that before. And I guess I turned bright red. I could feel the flush come over my face, you know? It was so weird. Nothing like that has ever happened between us, ever.", "input": "", "output": "What did you feel like when it happened?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I'm not sure. Weird. It was like I was having a dream or something. I mean there we were in public. Was that an act or what? She got all emotional on me and everything, it just completely blew me away. It was so not like her. Then Katherine said something to me as she was leaving. She said, \"That was pure and sweet, Alex.\" And she sort of smiled--you know, like she does--as if she was certain of what was going on in my head. And you know what else? You should have seen her jaw fall open when she met Luke. He's so handsome; everyone thinks he's gorgeous. But she couldn't hide her expression from me, I know her too well. I thought I had introduced them before, but they both said I hadn't. She was funny when she saw him. I told her, \"Number one, he's too young for you. And number two, he's already taken. So don't get any ideas, you hear?\" We got a good laugh out of that! Katherine looked fabulous, too, like right out of a page from Vogue. She gave my mom an interesting gift: season tickets to the opera. My mom was really taken by that. But I think Katherine was impressed with how nice everything was. She was probably expecting something different, something more like my mom--trashy--but my mom pulled it off wonderfully.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like the wedding went well."}, {"instruction": "For the most part it did. It's so cool--my parents are married! And everything went great, I guess...I mean other than my thumb. And Mark felt so bad about it, too, like it was all his fault or something. But it wasn't like he attacked me. We were fooling around a little too rough, that's all. Shit happens. But it totally hurts, dude.", "input": "", "output": "I can imagine. So things are going well with Luke?"}, {"instruction": "You know, they are. Almost too well. It's weird, too. The other day, someone trashed the studio at Ralph's place, made a big mess. Well, I'm not stupid, it was probably Regina, you know? And she probably thought we wouldn't figured it out. Well, Ralph extended the alarm system to cover the studio as well, and he put in these heavyduty locks, too. But Luke...well, he was sweet about it. Reminding me and making a joke out of it, he said that he knows exactly how she feels, referring to himself plowing over my paints that day--that infamous day--when he walked in on Camille and me. I'll never live it down.", "input": "", "output": "I don't know about that. I think you're already \"living it down,\" as you put it."}, {"instruction": "Well, we're able to joke about it now. That must mean everything is cool with him.", "input": "", "output": "A sense of humor always helps."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Oh yeah! I went to one of Tony's meetings at Rational Recovery. He said the main difference between this and a twelve-step program is that he finds the people not to be all sanctimonious about their recovery like those religious fanatics--the twelve-steppers. But he doesn't talk about pot smoking there. And he has a fan there, or a friend, I'm not sure which.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I met her. She was using crutches, and I was thinking, \"Oh no, a bleeder!\"", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "You know a bleeder--someone who bleeds for sympathy or milks a situation for all it's worth. But I think I was wrong about her. It's just that there's something about her I can't quite figure out. She sat right next to Tony and looked at him all googly-eyed. I don't know, he was oblivious, but I saw it right away, the moment she looked at him. She has this dark side, I think. We walked her back to her car. It was starting to get dark out, and I was thinking that she just wanted to dart out of there, both while we were in the meeting and when we were walking with her. She was kind of shy, but definitely complicated. She kind of intrigued me. And I know that Tony really likes her a lot, he said they sort of clicked when they first met. Sherry...no, Sharon, that's it, Sharon. So anyway, I went to this meeting and saw what it was about I guess. But still the fact remains that he is smoking like a fiend and thinks that just because he's not doing crystal-meth anymore, he's not using drugs. It's pointless to even try to argue with him about it.", "input": "", "output": "I agree with you, it's probably not in his best interest to be smoking marijuana given his past history of drug abuse, but it is up to him to decide if and when to quit. Perhaps you should congratulate him on stopping his crystal-meth use. Maybe it'll encourage him to go further."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know, but...shit! I'm just worried about him, about what he'll do next. He even let that girl stay at his house last weekend, and he doesn't even really know her. She could be a psychopath. And then what if he hooks up with her? You know like Cami and I did? He's been known to \"cross-over,\" as he puts it. Shit! She may even still be staying there.", "input": "", "output": "These are things you have no control over, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Well, I feel like if I somehow imagine the worst, it won't happen, and I'll be happily surprised. But if the worst does happen, I won't be stunned. Oh well. I know you're right. I've got to let it go or something.", "input": "", "output": "That's right, you do."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know. Oh yeah, the other day, I went over to my mom's and met the guys who moved this huge metal sculpture thing that someone from SII sent to the wedding reception. I think it was her boss or something. We didn't have a clue as to what to do with it, so we put it in the backyard. You can see it through the dining room window, twisting and turning. It's kind of cool, but really big. I mean huge! It's over ten feet tall, way over, with moving parts that move in the wind. And everyone was totally surprised when it arrived. You should have seen the looks on people's faces. Anyway, I picked up the mail and watered the backyard and stuff, since they're away on their honeymoon. While I was sitting at her desk, I found this pamphlet for Toughlove. Have you heard of them?", "input": "", "output": "Toughlove? Yes, I've heard about them."}, {"instruction": "I guess they think I'm out of control still. Some of those places set you up, get you kidnapped, and then send you away to Tahiti or something--someplace where no one knows to find you or even to look for you. And then they beat you, and make you do hard labor, and try to break your spirit and stuff. I'm glad I live with Ralph, he wouldn't let them take me like that.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you think they are planning? Did you find something that made you think this was their plan?"}, {"instruction": "No, it was just the Toughlove brochure. But it got me thinking about this shit, you know? I'm doing good now, better than before. Just the other day, I met with a counselor at school--it was one of those exit interviews for the year--and he told me that by the end of the first semester next year, I'll have enough credits to graduate early. I already knew that. But when I told my mom about it--it was around the time she got pissed at me that last time--she knew I would need her signature and she said she wouldn't do it. She thinks she's got me by the balls. But by the end of the first term next school year, I'll be eighteen and I won't need her signature. Cool, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I'm going to do the same thing with my driver's license. I'll wait until I'm eighteen for that, too. I won't need her approval for that either...just in case she's a psycho-bitch again, you never know. They make everything so complicated for kids these days, you know? If I want a driver's license, I have to have a permit first. And there's an age restriction on my passengers for like ever. And another signature is needed. It's all bullshit, and I don't need any of that right now, not ever! Going back to the wedding for a minute, you asked me what I felt like when she got all emotional. Well, I think that it hit her, finally. She was abandoned by Mark when she was pregnant with me, and she never got to realize her dream--she wanted to be married to him. And now...well, now she has finally got him, and I'm here, too. I don't know, maybe there's a chance for this family after all, you know? Maybe we can figure out a way to get over ourselves for a while and get along. When they get back from their honeymoon, Mark said he wants to have a talk with me about something, I don't know what--he was cryptic. But he wants to discuss something with me. Maybe it's about that Toughlove shit. So, it's pretty cool. Now I got what I always dreamed of: a father that is married to my mom, and a family. This all sounds weird coming out of my mouth.", "input": "", "output": "Weddings sometimes bring out the best in people. Who knows? Perhaps your family can move beyond its differences and get along. But I would caution you to take the same attitude with your hopes for your family as you are taking with Tony..."}, {"instruction": "Hope for the best and expect the worst?", "input": "", "output": "Precisely."}, {"instruction": "I know. You're probably right. It's all that I can do, I guess. But you know, if they plan to have me kidnapped, they have better be prepared for a huge fight. But I'm going to do them one better. I'm going to make sure that no more trouble comes my way, so they won't have an excuse to try to send me away. I'll be good from now on. Besides, I have some plans for myself and...well, I don't want anything interfering with that.", "input": "", "output": "Plans?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I've told you about that. You know, the theater? There, you do remember. You do pay attention to me after all! Ha! Ha! Just giving you a bad time, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Alex, keep up with the good work. I'll look forward to seeing you next week."}, {"instruction": "All right, man, see you later.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "These are nothing; you should see my arm. See? Worse, a lot worse. I had to protect myself, otherwise she would have torn my face off. The bitch!", "input": "", "output": "Regina?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah! She finally attacked me. It's sort of a long story, so I'll try to condense it for you. It didn't occur to me that Cami and Regina would be at the Alliance because of the time of day. But they are already out of school, and their time is their own. I had a half-day at school myself and decided to put in some more hours. I realized the other day that it's going to take forever to get my community work done. I only have between sixty and seventy hours right now, and I need over a thousand more. It's going to take me years to get it all done!", "input": "", "output": "It was a stern punishment."}, {"instruction": "You thought so, too? I thought at first, \"Oh, a thousand and twenty five hours, that's nothing.\" Well, even if I worked at it full time, it would probably take more than a year. They caught me off guard, I guess. I forgot what we were talking about.", "input": "", "output": "We were talking about how you got scratched up."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, right. Regina, the psycho-bitch...I should introduce her to my mother. Ha! Ha! So anyway, I had a half-day at school last week and thought I'd get in more hours at the Alliance. So I went over there not thinking that Cami and Regina could be there. And I...oh yeah, I almost forgot. Over the past couple of weeks, someone had been using my work area and leaving it a mess. They...she even broke one of the molds I was making for the sconces Josh and I designed. But I didn't put two and two together. I didn't even think that she was responsible for the damage, but she was. So when I got there, I went to talk to Josh about the molds and stuff. And then I looked over toward my storage locker and Regina was standing right in front of it. She didn't realize I was there, and she was doing something...I don't know what, but she was messing with my locker. Well, I went off.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I walked right over to her, and she was real surprised to see me there. She just froze for a minute, and I asked her what the hell she thought she was doing. Then she started swiping at me with her fingernails, and she was all swearing and calling me names: \"Faggot! Queer!\" And I was all: \"Thank you, tell me something I didn't already know, bitch!\" Then, when she actually got me a couple of times--she was going totally crazy, like a rabid animal or something, swinging and clawing at me--I got pissed off and pushed her real hard against the lockers. I pinned her there with all my weight.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you didn't..."}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't hit her, but I should have. The bitch was calling me names. I wouldn't go that far--I wouldn't use her sexuality against her like that, you know? Plus, she scratched me up pretty good, there was a lot of blood. And then she spit in my face and hissed at me that it was all my fault that Cami doesn't want her anymore, that she's no longer interested. I was all: \"It wasn't my fault.\" They were the ones who were pursuing me! By then, Josh and Cami got between us and split us apart. But Regina was still struggling to get at me, so I laughed at her and made things worse. So, anyway, that was when I finally came face to face with Cami.", "input": "", "output": "How did you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that was the best part. I asked her what was up with that. What did Regina mean that she didn't want her anymore? She said, \"That's right, I don't want to be with Regina anymore.\" But I told her that it wasn't my fault, that was her choice. That's when she dropped her bomb on me.", "input": "", "output": "Bomb?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. You'll never guess. She told me that since the incident between her and me, and even before that, that she had started to feel differently about me. Her thoughts were always of me, she couldn't stop thinking about me, stuff like that. Well, she wants to be with me! With me! I mean picture that--her and me. I was like, \"No way.\" Tony would have been rolling on the floor laughing over that. I was standing there looking at her and saying, \"You can't really mean that, you aren't serious.\" She looked me square in the eye and said it again, \"I want to be with you.\" I told her that it would never work. I'm gay, at least I'm supposed to be gay. And what about her? Isn't she a lesbian? I asked her that.", "input": "", "output": "How did she respond?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she didn't respond because she had to go see about Regina. So she just left me there to absorb this piece of news. I mean...um...how could she do this? How could she put me in the middle like that? I felt like this was her plan all along. What was she thinking? Did she think I would convert to heterosexuality? Gross! Things don't work that way. Plus, those two have already complicated my life enough, don't you think? I don't need this shit. So after they left--I mean like a split second after they were gone--Luke walked in. I was all, \"Whew! Perfect timing.\" It was just what I needed--to have him see those two with me. What a pretty little picture that would have been.", "input": "", "output": "Is Luke involved with the Arts Alliance, too?"}, {"instruction": "No, not at all. He's too busy with his work. He just came there to meet me and see what I was working on. I'm always talking about my work at the Alliance. So I showed him everything, my paintings and the embellishments I did to the edges of the stage. I made it look like some old artisans carved these curly leafy things all around it. Josh taught me how to make a mold and then pour the plaster. Luke was very impressed. But then he asked me where the scratches came from.", "input": "", "output": "What did you tell him?"}, {"instruction": "The truth, for once. I figured that if he could forgive me the way he has, then he could handle the truth.", "input": "", "output": "And did he?"}, {"instruction": "Handle it? Yeah, for the most part. But he was pissed at Regina, I saw his face turn kind of red. You can tell when he is pissed because he quiets down, like the calm before the storm. But I knew he wasn't pissed at me. I think he was pissed at the situation. Josh said that if this sort of thing continues, someone is going to have to go, and he didn't mean me. So, I don't know...she's going to have to get over it herself or get de-clawed!", "input": "", "output": "It's probably a good idea to keep your distance from her for now."}, {"instruction": "You're telling me. I know! But what really burned me up was Regina's sexist remarks to me designed to make me mad. I just thought she was so...I don't know, so childish. Sometimes, I think she's the female version of me. The stupid things she does...oh well. So, Tony has been busy this week, too busy for me even.", "input": "", "output": "What is he busy doing?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want to know, you know? He does his meetings, sometimes two or three a week. But I think he's spending a lot of time with that chick. What's her name? Sharon. Yeah, he's probably \"doing\" her. I don't know. Whatever. They're up to no good, I'm sure. He has been avoiding my calls, not returning them. I just hope he's not doing any speed again. I was thinking about calling his sister, Marney, to tell her about what's going on. I'm so worried. That girl is bad news. I just know she is.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, what are you doing there?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, sorry. It's just that my thumb itches something fierce. And no matter how much I scratch it, it doesn't help because the itch is deep inside. So I found that if I rub it like this, the itching feeling gets better, for a while at least.", "input": "", "output": "The itching is a good sign. It means it's healing."}, {"instruction": "I know, that's what Mark told me. They cut their honeymoon short because both Mark and Aaron came down with the flu. It's been going around again. I never catch shit that goes around. But if it weren't for \"Hell Nino,\" we wouldn't have to be putting up with all these bugs going around.

He basically told me, \"No more shit.\" He expects me to behave myself--no drugs, no stealing, no driving. He told me that they are allowing me to stay with Ralph because it's easier on the family that way. But if it was up to him, he would have me staying at the house with them. I was like, \"You're allowing me?\" Huh! My mom doesn't want me around anyway. He said that they were considering having me go to a more local school for my senior year, and I said, \"No way, dude!\" I told him that I would pay for it myself--my tuition, I mean--before I'd go to a public school here in the city.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like he is trying to show you how much he cares about you."}, {"instruction": "Uh huh, right! He just wants to control me or something. He even said that they were considering sending me away to some camp thing. Yeah! Can you believe that? It's just like I suspected.

If they try to send me away, I'd be in even more trouble because then, I would be violating my probation.", "input": "", "output": "Good point."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, one they hadn't thought of. So things are the same, but different. I knew he would come back changed now that my mom has that ring on her finger. It's like she's got him wrapped, totally.

The pictures were taken at the Dore Alley Street fair, and we were all done up in our leather and everything.", "input": "", "output": "Dore Alley?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. You haven't heard of it before? Wow! What rock have you been living under, Doc? Dore Alley. You really don't know what it is? Ha! Well, let me be the first to tell you about it. But when you realize that you're jaded, don't blame me.", "input": "", "output": "I won't."}, {"instruction": "It's the big event of the leather and S&M community here in The City. It's the precursor to the Folsom Street fair, but it's not so tourist-oriented. It's for the hardcore people--people in leather and latex, naked people, people getting golden showers, and people getting flogged. It's a real mind blowing experience. Tony and I were talking about going this year, but...well, now that he's all occupied with that Sharon person...well, I don't know if he'll ever have any time for me.", "input": "", "output": "So Tony is spending a lot of time with this woman?"}, {"instruction": "A lot of time? No, all of his time. He doesn't return my calls. And when I finally reach him, he's always busy doing something with her. Somehow, she is taking my place, and I'm not sure what to do about it...or if there is anything I can do about it. Plus, with all the pot smoking he's doing...well, I don't know that I want to be around that. I'm already down enough. I don't need that shit to drag me even further down.", "input": "", "output": "That's a wise choice, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah? So where were we?", "input": "", "output": "Benny, I believe."}, {"instruction": "Right. So anyway, I suddenly had these pictures in front of me, and I was thinking about him--about the things I did with him. What a liar, what a heal! I went for it, too. He had me wrapped so tightly around his little world that I never thought to really look at what was really happening, you know? I wasn't paying attention to what was going on. I'm so mixed up about him. I wish I hadn't seen those pictures. I wish I had thrown them away, but I forgot they even existed. Shit! I...uh, it's just that...uh...um...", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. Here are some tissues."}, {"instruction": "Fuck! I'm such a little pussy sweater boy sometimes, you know? Why can't I get over this already? Why does he have to keep popping up? And do you know what else happened? I was with Ralph, he had to get some papers at his club. I was waiting in the car outside, when this guy, Ryan, walked up. Ryan was one of Benny's friends, sort of. They did their \"business\" shit together. Anyway, he saw me, came over to the car, and asked me what I was up to. Well, I knew he was trying to do--like always, he just came right out and told me that he had a \"job\" for me if I was interested. Well, I knew what that meant, and I wasn't about to go there. So I climbed out of the car and stood up to him. He stepped back a little--it's been a while since he saw me. And I just said, \"You got a job for me, huh? Well, chew on this, dude!\" And I grabbed myself like this, and he just sort of stood there like he thought I was joking with him or something. And I was all, \"Fuck you, dude. I'm not into that shit anymore!\" Just then, Ralph came out of the club and got into the car. So, I climbed back into the car, and that guy was sort of standing there, stunned, not knowing what to do or say. He didn't expect me to be like that I guess. We just drove away after that.", "input": "", "output": "How did that made you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Like shit. Like total fucking trash, you know? It reminded me of the things I used to do--tricking out and shit. And I liked it, too. At least I thought I was having fun with it, but I wasn't really. Inside, I felt like I was being used, which I was. But all the attention I got was better than what I was getting at home, I guess. I don't know. I'm not making any sense, I know.", "input": "", "output": "You're making sense, Alex. It makes sense that you enjoyed the attention. As wrong as it was, you were getting some attention. Every child needs and craves attention. Your mother wasn't there for you."}, {"instruction": "I'll second that. Shit! I'll third that, too! The other night, I was over at the house, and Mark was showing his pictures to Racyl and Rhea and me. He was telling stories about the first time each of them walked and talked, shit like that. Well, I remember the things my...uh, my grandmother used to tell me. I remember...ah, shit! Here we go again. Dammit!", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. Just take a moment."}, {"instruction": "Well, I looked up and away from Mark. I was thinking about my grandmother, and for a second, my eyes locked onto my mother's eyes--she was looking at me with this vacant stare. Well, it struck me right there--there is no one left who remembers when I took my first step or said my first word. She doesn't remember, she wasn't even there. And the look on her face told me that she was thinking the very same thing I was thinking. She wasn't there to remember stuff like that. How am I supposed to feel about that?", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I feel alone, so totally fucking alone. The people that cared enough about me to raise me...well, they all abandoned me. They're gone. And I'm stuck with her--the woman with no memory of me. She better not fuck things up with little Aaron, you know? She just didn't care enough about me to be there, to be my mother. And now...well, it's too late now. I don't know how I feel about this. I'm mad. I'm pissed that my grandmother is gone. Sometimes, I still dream about her, about how she treated me, and about the things we used to do together, stuff like that. Usually, when I wake up from having a dream about her, I wake up crying. But I get through it, you know? Still, it bothers me. Sometimes, I think it always will bother me. I miss her. Every day, I still miss her.", "input": "", "output": "It's normal to miss someone you loved. And you may be right; you may find that you will always miss her. That pain will vary, sometimes less depending upon the memory and your state of mind at the time. But the thing to remember is that you will always have her with you. As long as you have your memories, she will always be alive."}, {"instruction": "Just like Benny.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Just like Benny. I miss him too, sometimes. I'm ashamed to admit it, but it's true. Sometimes, I miss him. And sometimes, I hate him. And sometimes, I want to hit my head and forget about him. But it will never be that easy. With my luck, I'd hit my head and forget everything but him! The bastard! And if Luke knew how I felt about this, I don't know how he'd react, you know? It would probably mess his shit up. Do you think I should tell him?", "input": "", "output": "What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm not comfortable telling him about everything yet, not so soon after we got back together.", "input": "", "output": "You don't have to share everything with Luke, at least not yet.

I already have a big secret to hide from him.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "You know about it. The triangle: Regina, Cami, and I. Cami's been on my mind a lot lately, too. Since school let out, I had more time to spend at the Alliance and, naturally, I get to see her there all the time now. Luckily, Regina isn't coming back. She had it out with Josh, and I guess he told her not to come back anymore. So Cami is heavy on my mind lately, especially after what she told me: she wants to be with me. Well, that affected me so much that I even dreamt about her a few times. In one of the dreams, she told me she was pregnant with my child. I was totally freaking out. And if Luke knew the truth, he'd have a coronary like his dad.", "input": "", "output": "But you told me that he knows what happened."}, {"instruction": "To a point, yes. He saw the scratches.", "input": "", "output": "They're healing up nicely, by the way."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, they are. And my thumb is much better, too. It's not as itchy as it was. Luke knows that Regina attacked me, that much I told him. But I sort of let him believe that she did it out of anger over what came down between Cami and I at my studio. I haven't told him that Cami said she wants to be with me or that she has broken up with Regina.", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think he's going to figure it out? Maybe it's better if you told him yourself?"}, {"instruction": "I know. It's just that I don't know how to tell him.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you haven't done anything wrong. Cami simply made her feelings known to you. You aren't at fault."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but if Luke finds out, he won't want me to go to the Alliance anymore. He'll get worried that something may happen again. I don't know how secure he really is with any of that, even though he made some jokes about it.", "input": "", "output": "I would encourage you to tell him. It will ease that burden for you, and you'll be surprised how he might respond. Just be certain to assure him that you have this under control and that nothing can or will happen at the Alliance."}, {"instruction": "But can I really do that? Can I really control it? She's been going out of her way to be nice to me--she's all smiles. It's not flirting so much as it is being a little friendlier than normal people are to me. Oh, I don't know. I'll think on this some more. How do I get myself into these messes? I'm so confused about her...about him...I mean about Benny. Ever since that thing that I told you about with my mom and me and the eye thing, I'm constantly thinking about my mom, and my family, and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "We need to spend more time talking about these feelings. It's good to say it out loud, Alex, to let some of the build-up emotions out. And again, I would encourage you to talk about this not only with me, but with others who care about you like Ralph and Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. But Katherine is going away. I'm kind of bummed because I haven't been seeing her as much these days. She's working on so many projects. The Arts Alliance is only one of them. And now she's talking about going on a trip to Alaska. Who wants to go there? It's cold like all the time there. Burr! Ralph is okay to talk to, but he's got his own shit, too. So we trade shit stories sometimes. Oh, well, I guess we're running over time again.", "input": "", "output": "We are a little, but it's okay sometimes. You are my last appointment for the day. Well, I'll see you next week. And please call me, if you need anything, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thanks, dude. I do kind of feel better now than when I first came in.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that."}, {"instruction": "Thanks again, man.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "It's...it's...uh, it's Darla, my rat. I took...uh, I just left her at the veterinarian. She's been real sick lately, and the doctor thinks...uh, he thinks that she might have been...she might have been poisoned.", "input": "", "output": "Oh Alex. I'm sorry that she's sick. Why does the doctor think she was poisoned?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's what I'd like to know. She hasn't been right for the past week or two. And then all of a sudden, she swelled up like a balloon, and she was all foaming and...uh, you should have seen how pathetic she looked. She might die, and I can't believe it! I don't know but it might be...I think that Regina did it. I think she may have fed her something when she tore up my art studio. But that was a few weeks back, and it's hard for me to believe that it would've taken so long for Darla to get sick like that. I don't know. But if it turns out that she's poisoned her, I'm going to kill Regina, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Well, try not to jump to any conclusions, Alex. Like you said, the break-in was several weeks ago..."}, {"instruction": "So? She could have done something to her then, she could've!", "input": "", "output": "I think you need to wait until the doctor looks Darla over. Wait until you hear what he has to say before you convict Regina."}, {"instruction": "If it turns out that she did...oh fuck! I can't believe this, you know? I just can't fucking believe this. Darla is still young for a rat, and now she's acting like she's got Mad Cow Disease or something...no, Mad Rat Disease. Dammit! I'm going back over to the vet's tonight to see how she's doing.", "input": "", "output": "I hope she'll be okay, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Me too. And Regina better hope the same thing, too. I swear, I'll kill her if anything happens to my little Darla.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I'd like to be certain that you're not really going to do anything to Regina..."}, {"instruction": "Do you mean like kill her?", "input": "", "output": "Would you really hurt Regina?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'm just going to make her suffer, like Darla is suffering now.", "input": "", "output": "Can I remind you that you don't even know for a fact that Regina had anything to do with Darla's illness?"}, {"instruction": "She is responsible. I know she is. And I'll make her pay, the little bitch, I swear I will. Women are really starting to bug me! Here I have Regina--hell's daughter. And then there's Sharon--little miss move in and take over--and she's is...how do I put it? Odd. Yeah, that's it, Sharon's odd.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, like I've told you before, she sort of has taken my place with Tony. He seems to spend every waking moment with her. He doesn't return phone calls and then...well, fuck! I can't stand it anymore! Oh! It just burns me up, what she's doing...what she's done to Tony, to me. The other day, I was tired of not being able to reach him. I always get his machine. So I decided to just go over there. Well, big mistake!", "input": "", "output": "What happened when you went there?"}, {"instruction": "Oh nothing, really. I just went up to the door, and I could smell the smoke outside. If the cops ever walked up there, Tony would be busted without a chance. It totally reeked! I went to knock on the door, and I heard these noises--giggling and snorting or something--coming from inside. Anyway, I walked around and looked inside. And guess what I found? Go ahead, guess.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "You can't figure it out? Well, think \"Alex and Cami.\" Bingo! Your face tells all. Well, imagine what I thought. Jeez! There they were, the two of them, wrapped around each other, sucking their tongues out, totally going for it, licking each other's tonsils and shit. I mean gross! Now I know what Luke felt like.", "input": "", "output": "But you're not Tony's boyfriend."}, {"instruction": "Good point. I was thinking of how I can get rid of that bitch. What can I do to make her just go away? And do you know what came to my mind, to my pointy little head? I thought I should just throw myself at him, make him want me. And then I can seduce him and get him away from her. That would make him get rid of her. Bitch, be gone! What a warped fucker I am, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Somehow, I can't see you doing something like that."}, {"instruction": "You can't? Well aren't you the innocent one. You forget what I used to do for a living. Tricking was no problem for me.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe it wasn't then..."}, {"instruction": "Oh! I get it. You think I've lost my nerve? Think again. I can do it again..well, I can! Why are you looking at me like that?", "input": "", "output": "Because I distinctly remember a conversation we just recently had about this very topic."}, {"instruction": "And?", "input": "", "output": "You described to me how you told Benny's friend that you weren't into doing tricks anymore. I believe you described yourself as making an obscene gesture and swearing at him for suggesting a possible job for you. And you told me that while at the time you thought you were having fun with it, you really felt used by the men you worked for."}, {"instruction": "Pretty screwed up, aren't I? It's just...it's...uh...", "input": "", "output": "Here, Alex, here's a tissue. I'm sorry to put it so bluntly, I know how difficult it is for you. But I had to remind you..."}, {"instruction": "What? Remind me what?", "input": "", "output": "It wasn't your fault."}, {"instruction": "That's easy for you to say.", "input": "", "output": "It wasn't your fault, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Benny really warped the fuck out of me, huh? The other day, the day before Luke left for New York, we were getting all heavy and hot, but...but now...it felt all wrong. It was like I wasn't interested in sex. It was like I was almost repulsed by it or something, but at the same time I craved it. I craved Luke, but couldn't do it with him. Does that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "These feelings are common among survivors of sexual abuse and people who were sexualized at an early age. Benny betrayed your trust and took advantage of you. You were craving attention, and your body responded to him. It wasn't your fault, Alex. Benny taught you to express your need for human attention and love through sex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well...Luke and I did it anyway.", "input": "", "output": "And how did you feel after that?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm? I don't know. Now that I think about it, it felt good, I guess. But it felt like I was seeing it from above, like I wasn't really there with him. It was kind of weird, huh?", "input": "", "output": "You detached yourself from the situation."}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "Detaching oneself from action is a way of escaping the situation. By trying not to be there, you were protecting yourself. You probably did the same thing while you were tricking."}, {"instruction": "I think you might be right. It always felt so...I don't know, not real. I'm not the kind of person who just likes to have sex with everybody, like most guys do. Guys I know--straight or gay, it doesn't matter--have sex with anyone who is willing just for the sake of getting off. And to me that's totally sick. It always was, I guess. It always was...", "input": "", "output": "Alex?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm? Oh! I was just thinking. I wonder if girls are like that, too? Take this Sharon person. I wonder if she is just trying to prove she can seduce a gay guy. Some women are like that you know--they like the challenge. Take Cami, for instance.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that's what she is trying to do?"}, {"instruction": "Probably. I don't know. Shit! She's so nice to me now, all the time. She even finagled her way into my project at the Alliance. That was supposed to be my project. Mine. And she went and wiled her way in. And then she was all nice and sweet. And it wasn't like it was an act or something. Oh, I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore. But it's not like I can send her away or anything. She's just there now, all the fucking time. Why are women like that? Why are they so manipulative? Guys don't play games and shit like that, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, not all women are like that, and not all men are out to simply get off, as you say. Most people are good and honest. And most are not out to take advantage of you either. Most people want the same things--to be loved, to be respected, to have peace..."}, {"instruction": "So what are you trying to say? Hmm?", "input": "", "output": "The world isn't so black and white. Even though some people have hurt you in the past, most people aren't really bad and I think you know that. Think about Ralph, for example. He took you in and he cares about you. But originally, he was one of your tricks. And Katherine and Luke..."}, {"instruction": "Okay, all right. You're making me ill with all this niceness. I get your point, but it's hard to see it sometimes...no, most of the time, lately...", "input": "", "output": "I understand. But I think you've done remarkably well. Take notice of your accomplishments. When you start to get yourself all worked up, just stop and look at where you are now as opposed to where you were just a year ago."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know, but it's hard. I guess I need you to remind me sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "I just did."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you did, didn't you? I don't know. What do I do now?", "input": "", "output": "Are you asking me how you should deal with these conflicting feelings?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's it. That's what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "I think you should keep talking about it. Let it out. Do you remember the \"overflowing bucket\" analogy?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I do. And mine has been overflowing for a while now! Why can't I get amnesia or something? I know--that would be too easy.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Alex, it looks like we're out of time. I hope Darla gets better."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Me too. I am going to go back over to the vet's right now. See you later, man.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex. See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Later. And Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Thanks a lot, dude!", "input": "", "output": "All right, Alex, take care. And call if you need to, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. I'm okay.", "input": "", "output": "What is it? What's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess it shows, huh? It's Darla, she died.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Alex, I'm very sorry. I know how much she meant to you."}, {"instruction": "I guess I'm kind of over it now...well, almost...I don't know. The doctor couldn't do anything for her. He couldn't even make her more comfortable. So she just died, and I felt...uh, I feel so damn guilty.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you feel guilty?"}, {"instruction": "Well, at first, I wanted to blame Regina. Thankfully, she wasn't home when I went over to her house to murder her. She's in Lebanon.", "input": "", "output": "The Middle East?"}, {"instruction": "No, in Tennessee. I think it's called Lebanon or something, I don't know. Who cares, really. The bitch may as well be in the Mediterranean, for all I care. The further away she is, the better. No, so she wasn't there, and I was ready to rip her black little heart out, too.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "The doctor took some blood samples and analyzed them, but he didn't get the results right away. Darla may have had some kind of bug thing, but the doctor thought with all the exposure to the paints and solvents in my studio, over time, she was overwhelmed and her little body couldn't take it anymore. That was probably what killed her. It was me. I did it! It's just...uh, it's what I thought was best, you know? I thought it would be good to keep her in the studio. Ralph didn't like having her in the house. And with his cats...well, I didn't want to keep her in the house. So that's the reason I feel so guilty over it. And I was so quick to blame Regina for it, too. Lucky for me, she was away when I went over there. Lucky for her, too.", "input": "", "output": "That could've been a very nasty situation. I'm sorry about Darla. But you couldn't have known that the paints in your studio would kill her. And you said she may have been ill..."}, {"instruction": "I am, but I'm not, you know? I'm to blame, and yet...I mean there's nothing I can do about it now anyway. I buried her in the Aids Grove in Golden Gate Park. It's real pretty there. Have you ever been there?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I have been there. It's a beautiful spot."}, {"instruction": "It's probably the most beautiful place in the entire park. It's the only place--and I mean the only place--that gets so much love and attention. So she's not suffering anymore, and I buried her in a beautiful place, in nature, where she belongs. So, let's change the subject, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What would you like to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "Benny. I know you're probably getting sick of hearing about him.", "input": "", "output": "No, Alex, I'm not. Please, go on."}, {"instruction": "I got a call from Dora this week. She told me that Benny is in the prison hospital. He got beat up by some of the other inmates. It's just like I told you--they don't like child molesters in prison. I mean you can't go much lower than that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. So he got his butt kicked real good, and I told her he deserves it...that and much much more, too, the piece of garbage that he is. Well, it got me to thinking even more about him and about some of the things he did.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of things?"}, {"instruction": "Mainly, I was thinking about the day their daughter was born. That morning, they went to the hospital because Dora was having those contractions you get just as you're about to have a baby. He called to tell me the baby was coming. He was real excited about it. But I don't know how much was real and how much was an act, you know? He was such a good actor. He should win an Academy Award, you know? So I went over there to be there with him, with them. You should have seen his face when he brought her out for me to see. She was so little in his arms, and he was beaming with pride. I can see it all in my mind like it was yesterday...that proud look he had. Anyway, later that evening, Benny and I went home to his house and we ended up in bed...in their bed...in his and Dora's bed and we had sex. All night long, we had sex. What kind of person does that? How could he be fooling around with me while his wife was lying there in the hospital all ripped to shreds after giving birth to their baby? Why would someone do something like that? What a sick mother-fucker! It was like he didn't even care about them, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, Benny is a sick individual."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  He was sick.  Not only was he two faced, but he was a user.  He didn't care about anyone's feelings. He messed with my head. He destroyed his own life and tried to destroy mine. What was the word you used: a sociopath?  Think what he did to Dora and his daughter.  There isn't anything redeeming about him or his character. I'm much better now without him.  So given all that, why do I still feel so much about him? Why do I sometimes think that I miss him? Oh shit! Don't answer that. I know, I know. It's like those kidnap victims, like that Patty Hearst chick. After awhile, you start to identify with your abuser and you start to think that it's a good thing or something.", "input": "", "output": "That's possible. Where did you hear about that?"}, {"instruction": "Patty Hearst? We studied her in class last term. And now she's a movie star doing John Waters movies, can you believe it? One minute, she's this rich girl. Then, she's out robbing banks. And now, she's a damned movie star. What a country we live in, huh?", "input": "", "output": "This is quite a place, isn't it? I'm impressed with your insight, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah? Well, I got another one--Tony. It's been bugging the hell out of me. This Sharon person is hanging out with him all the time. And I just know they are doing drugs together, besides just pot, I mean. So I was thinking, how do I get rid of her? Well, I was talking to him about her, and I asked him if he told her that he is HIV positive yet.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He said he hasn't. She hadn't asked him, so why should he bring it up? He claims they're not doing anything that would put her at risk anyway, which I find totally hard to believe. But then, later, I thought, \"What if she found out that he is HIV positive?\" She'd be out of there in a flash, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "Now, don't go and try to persuade me not to do it.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, Tony's going to be very angry at you if you interfere.  But it's your call."}, {"instruction": "Well, if I don't do something, he may end up in the hospital again or worse. I have got to do something to get her away from him. What else can I do? It's not like he's going to send her away himself.", "input": "", "output": "You can tell Tony how you feel about him taking drugs again. Tell him that you are worried about him. Offer him your support."}, {"instruction": "Uh...I don't know, man, I just don't know. It's not like he's there for me right now. I don't know what I'm going to do. I was hoping that he and I could go to the Gay Pride Parade next Sunday together, but he's busy with her. Then there's Dore Alley next month. And after that, I got tickets to see Stevie Nicks in concert. But he's going to be with Sharon. Sharon, Sharon, Sharon! That's all he ever wants to talk about. Well, fuck her! It's not like I'm going to be able to bring Ralph to any of that, now that he's sick again. And of course Cami has offered to go with me, but...", "input": "", "output": "Ralph is ill again?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I thought I told you.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I knew that he has AIDS, but you hadn't mentioned that he's sick again. What's going on with him?"}, {"instruction": "This time it's colon cancer. Can you believe that? On top of AIDS, he's got a bum colon. A bad bum! Ha! Ha! Ha! Get it? A bad bum!", "input": "", "output": "I got it."}, {"instruction": "Well, you're supposed to laugh. And I just made that up, too! Lately, I've been coming up with the funniest things. The other day, when Luke came back from working in New York, we went to the beach together. Remember those real hot days we had?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do. I noticed you got some nice color."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I tan well. Anyway, he and I were walking along the shore and we come upon this couple, a straight couple. They were all wrapped around one another, doing the Tony and Sharon thing--tongues all twisting and everything. I said to Luke, \"Would you just look at that?\" If he and I were doing that, we'd probably get gay-bashed or something. But it's okay for straight people to do it in public, you know? So anyway, I said, \"Hey! You, over there! Yeah, you two. Don't you know there are homosexuals on this beach who find your public display of heterosexual affections disgusting and appalling?\"", "input": "", "output": "Alex!"}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't, really. They knew we were looking at them, though. And Luke was practically on the ground roaring with laughter. It just sort of spilled out of my mouth, without any second thoughts, you know? I didn't realize how funny it was until after I saw his reaction. But I mean really, like I said, if he and I were doing that there in public...well, you get the picture. It's okay if the straights do it, but not the gays.", "input": "", "output": "I understand what you mean, and I can't say that I disagree."}, {"instruction": "Okay? Thank you. What were we talking about before I went off on that little tangent?", "input": "", "output": "You were telling me about Ralph's illness."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah. That. Well, it seems that he has colon cancer now. And he has to go in the hospital to have surgery or something. I'm really trying not to get myself all worked up over it. But I don't know what I would do if he were to die on me. I don't even want to think about that. He said the doctor told him he has a good chance of getting through this because of his age and his overall good health...well, except for the AIDS thing that is. How did we get on this subject anyway? Oh yeah. We were talking about the parade next weekend and all the other events on my social calendar for the summer. Luke may be able to go to the parade with me, but he definitely won't do Dore Alley--you know how he feels about the S&M stuff. But if he's not working, he said he'd go and see Stevie Nicks with me, even though he thinks she's old and he's not really into her music. I'm like, \"She's not old, okay? She's timeless, ageless.\" So, anyway, we're almost out of time, aren't we?", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid so, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Jeez! Time really rolls right along in here sometimes, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I know what you mean."}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I better be on my way. I've got to get over to the Arts Alliance to finish up some backdrops Cami and I are painting. We're putting on a play there in August. It's a modern version of \"A Midsummer's Night\" thing. You ought to come and see it. It would do you good to get out some.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'll consider it. I'll see you next week. Take care, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, man, you too. Catch you later, dude!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, dude!", "input": "", "output": "Who's that out there?"}, {"instruction": "Oh. That's only Cami. She's going to wait for me out there. Is that okay?", "input": "", "output": "Well, yes, it's fine. Why is she with you today?"}, {"instruction": "It's a long story. We have to get over to the Alliance right after I'm done here--we need to put some finishing touches on the stuff we're painting for the play. She's kind of hooked on my hip lately. She even went to the parade with me last Sunday. Actually, she's turning out to be a real good friend. Really.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "What? What do you mean? Are you implying that I'm boinking her? What? Why do you look at me like that?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex. I didn't mean to imply anything. I'm just surprised. You clearly stated your desire to stay away from Cami."}, {"instruction": "Well, duh! Can't a guy and a girl be friends? What's so wrong with that?", "input": "", "output": "Nothing is wrong with that, Alex. I'm concerned that she might be feeling more than just friendship for you. You recently told me that she said she wanted to have a romantic relationship with you. I wonder how she was able to work out those feelings for you to be just a good friend."}, {"instruction": "Well, I think she has...uh, maybe...I guess...I don't know. Why is that such a big deal?", "input": "", "output": "Mainly because if she hasn't worked out these feelings for you and if she is still pining away for you, then she has ulterior motives for being with you."}, {"instruction": "We're friends, okay? Just friends. I like her and she likes me. Just because we hug each other and give little peck kisses, doesn't mean we are heading for the bedroom. At least I don't have to hide it from Luke anymore. He seems to understand, surprisingly. With his past--the brain-dead ex-girlfriend--he doesn't have much room to talk. But he saw us working together at the Alliance, and he sort of warmed up to her, too. I told you she's infectious. You'd fall for her, too. And she did the sweetest thing. The other day, I went over to the AIDS Grove in Golden Gate Park, where I buried Darla, and someone had put a small bouquet of flowers right on the spot where I buried her. No one could've known where that spot was exactly except me. Well, I knew it couldn't be Ralph--he's been too sick to do something like that. And I knew it wasn't Tony--he's too stoned. And it couldn't have been Luke--he's too busy working. Well, it was Cami. She followed me the day I buried Darla and decided that flowers would be a good way to honor her or something. I thought it was the sweetest thing, and I told her so. I don't know, Doc, if I wasn't gay and if things were a little different, I might have gone for it with her. But don't worry, I do have my feelings under control here. So don't get your shorts all twisted up, okay?", "input": "", "output": "As long as you're comfortable with it."}, {"instruction": "There! So we're cool with it? Okay! So anyway, Ralph had his surgery the other day, and it didn't go as planned.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, let me back up a minute. Saturday night, he had to drink this stuff. I don't know what it was called, but it was gross! It made his body cleanse itself--totally bonafide gross-out! He was practically glued to the toilet all night long. And then on Sunday morning, I had just about enough of him and his bodily noises and stuff--I mean, gross! Thankfully, the parade was that day, so I didn't have to sit through any more of that. I got punished, though, for thinking how really gross it was and for showing him my displeasure with it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "My payback came after the parade. The parade was cool, except for those religious fanatics I love so much. It started with a plane flying over with a banner: \"Repent. Jesus loves you.\" And then I almost got into it again with one of them. This time, this guy had a button that read: \"Your condition is curable, ask God.\" It was something like that. So I went up to him and asked him what the hell that meant. He started to quote to me what that guy in Congress or wherever said--you know the one who said that shit about kleptomaniacs and gays? So he said that if you want to be cured, all you have to do is seek out God. I started to tell him that maybe he could get a cure for that ugly-ass face he had. And Cami got between us and worked her magic on me. She calmed me down and got me away from that dude. Don't those people have anything better to do with their time? You should have seen him! He was so ugly, even a blind and desperate homosexual wouldn't want him! And we can change being gay about as easy as he can change being a butt-ugly bastard. That's what I wanted to tell him. Asking someone who's gay to change would be like asking someone to change their genetics, their eye color, or something like that, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "I agree."}, {"instruction": "Lucky for me, Cami was the voice of reason there--lucky for that dude, too. \"Those who live in glass houses\" and all that bullshit...anyway, where were we? Oh yeah, payback.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, please tell me what happened."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's right. Oh my, talk about gross! So after the parade, I decided to go see Tony and tell him about the parade and the things we did and saw, stuff like that. I stopped at China Palace to pick up some Chinese take-out and brought it over to Tony's. Don't ever go there for Chinese--it was a big mistake. Tony didn't eat any of the sweet and sour shrimp--I kind of kept it for myself and we're talking a huge mistake! I don't know if it was payback for pointing out to that dude his putrid ugliness, or if it was for complaining about Ralph and all the pretty noises he was making, but I got paid back in spades. It was like monkeys were flying out of my ass! I was praying to the porcelain god, and poor Tony got the pleasure of my presence. Man! It was coming out of both ends. I had to stay the night there at his house, because I couldn't even stand up. It was totally gross!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex. It sounds like you had an awful case of food poisoning."}, {"instruction": "To put it mildly! So, there I was, lying on the sofa at Tony's, and that girl, Sharon, showed up. Well, I could hear them talking and laughing and shit. And I could smell the smoke. I knew that before long, they would be trying to give each other a tonsillectomy with their tongues. So I tried to get up to leave, but I didn't get far before I had to go back to the porcelain worship hole. So Sharon decided to help me, as if she were my friend or something.", "input": "", "output": "What did she do?"}, {"instruction": "She hobbled over to me--she had an accident or something and now she uses a wheelchair or crutches sometimes--and she sort of hovered and made sure I got back onto the couch. And that was when the idea hit me, and my wheels started to turn.", "input": "", "output": "I don't like the sound of this..."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry, I got paid back for that right away, too. I just sort of accidentally on-purpose let it slip about Tony's HIV status.", "input": "", "output": "As sick as you were, you thought of that?"}, {"instruction": "It really just presented itself to me...on a silver platter, or so I thought. So anyway, how did I put it? I said something like: \"Lucky, Tony didn't eat any of the sweet and sour. He's just not up to it like I am, you know?\" And do you know what? It didn't even faze the bitch. I know she heard me, and I'm sure she got my meaning. I know she did. But it was like she already knew and was agreeing with me. I don't know, it was weird. Well, her reaction sort of shut me up, it was like maybe I'd said too much already. It was hard to tell what she was thinking. But I got the sense that she already knew Tony's HIV status and what I had sort of mentioned was not important to her. I guess I was expecting the shock to alter her expression, but there was no shock at all. So my plan...", "input": "", "output": "Backfired."}, {"instruction": "Well, the thing is I now wonder if Tony actually lied to me about this. He told me that he hadn't mentioned it to her and that they hadn't talked about it at all. But why would he lie to me about that? What's up with that?", "input": "", "output": "Why is it important to you?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? I guess you're right. It really isn't, I guess. Hmm, I just wonder, that's all. What would make him think that he needs to lie to me? Oh well. We were talking about something else before all this about Tony...", "input": "", "output": "I think you were telling me about Ralph."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah! The surgery thing. Oh man, it's fucked up. I don't know what it all means just yet, but it's not what they expected. So it's bad. They operated on him for like five hours, and it was only supposed to take two or something. They looked around and decided they couldn't get to the area that had the growth. It was something about some scar tissue being in the way. So now it means he has to wait for his stomach to heal up, and then he'll  need chemo and radiation treatments. It doesn't sound so good, you know?", "input": "", "output": "It does sound serious, Alex. I do wish him the best."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Me too. I wish this wasn't happening. It's like he can die from this, and that scares me. We were just getting used to each other and becoming more like friends. But you know what he said to me after he was coming out of the drug-induced haze? He said something like, \"Are you going to start doing my dishes in your underwear for me?\" I'm like, \"Uh huh. Yeah. Right, dude. Anything you say, hmm...\"", "input": "", "output": "The anesthesia will make you say funny things."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, right. Funny. I can let it slip for now, but I hope it was only the drugs and not what he really wants me to do. Some people say that the drugs just lift your inhibitions and reveal the true self.", "input": "", "output": "It's hard to say, Alex. I would imagine it would affect some people one way, while affecting others differently. It was a strange request."}, {"instruction": "Maybe. Maybe not. You have to think about where I've been with him.", "input": "", "output": "That's true."}, {"instruction": "Oh well, I can't even think about the possibility of him dying, you know? I just don't want to think about that. He means so much to me, and he has done a lot for me. Shit! I didn't want to get started on this. I just know that he's going to be okay. I just know it, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Keep thinking positively, Alex. My best wishes are with him."}, {"instruction": "The chemo and radiation are going to be rough, too. It's not going to be easy on him...on us, I guess. Wow! I hadn't even thought of that before. I've got to go. Cami's out there waiting for me, and we have to get over to the Alliance to finish up some things. Thanks for listening to me ramble on today.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't ramble, Alex. Take care and I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, dude. I...uh, I got to go. Later!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Never mind, it's been a rough week. So don't start, okay? What? What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to tell me what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Sorry, dude. It's just...it's...well, it's been a real shitty week, you know? Ralph is home now, and it's not pretty, I'm telling you. And my little slip with Sharon backfired on me for the second time, but no thanks to her. Regina tried to crash a party on the Fourth of July but failed; failed; failed! About the only good thing that has happened lately is that I got to spend some time with Katherine before she left for Alaska. So where do you want me to start?", "input": "", "output": "You spent some time with Katherine?"}, {"instruction": "Well, a few days before the party she threw at the Alliance on the Fourth, she and I went for a cool boat ride with Professor Cullem and his wife on their sailboat. It was so totally cool! The boat isn't very big, but we went out on the Bay, and up through the Golden Gate, and out into the open ocean for awhile. After we got off the boat, my legs felt like rubber for the rest of the night. It was a trip! The professor is cool for an old dude. He's into anthropology or something like that. His wife was nice, too. She wore all this jewelry, like an old Indian woman would wear, and she was kind of...I don't know, she was sort of mystical or something. But anyway, the boat was fun. They let me steer for awhile. They had everything which had to do with sailing that thing down to a science, so I just watched in awe. I was hoping and praying that a huge whale would jump clean out of the water near us. Everyone would have shitted in their pants if it happened. I know I would have!", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a nice day."}, {"instruction": "It was. After that, Katherine and I went back to my place. Ralph wasn't home from the hospital yet, and I hadn't cooked all week--no real need to. And you know what she wanted? Fondue.", "input": "", "output": "Fondue?"}, {"instruction": "You heard me right. I thought that stuff was a thing of the past, the seventies, at least that's what I've heard. But I searched until I found a recipe and I made it from scratch. It was so Velveeta! And I baked some sourdough from scratch and some vegetables. And man--I gorged myself silly. Katherine really liked it, it was what she said she wanted. She brought over something, but I couldn't eat any of it--that fondue shit fills you up! I let out a huge burp, and Katherine just laughed. She looked good. By now, she's probably in Alaska, I guess. We talked and talked for hours. We talked about anything and everything: her trip, and what she hopes to find; and me, and my current little psychodrama. It was just as if no time had passed since we last spent any time together.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. I thought she had already left.  I'm glad you were able to get together with Katherine before her trip, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, me too. I hope when I'm her age, I'll be like her. Successful, that's what she is. Successful--that's when you can just get up and go somewhere--wherever you want, whenever you want--and have no responsibilities. Well, it's not that she doesn't have any responsibilities, but you know what I mean. Well, it was fun and the party...you should have seen it. All kinds of people showed up, including Regina. It was such a great mix of people. I think some of the people there were from SII, but mostly they were art people. I saw Selvyn there; I haven't seen him in a long time. I told him about Ralph, he didn't know. I saw a lot of people I recognized. I was expecting Jake to show up. It was sort of a going away party for Katherine, the way it turned out, but he never...oh well.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And that foolish little bitch Regina tried to crash the party. Before I knew what was happening, there was some ruckus going on. And then I saw her--it was as if the entire crowd turned their eyes towards her. She practically crawled away in shame. Later, a rumor came around that she had a gun--she bought it at a gun shop. But yeah, right. I don't believe she could buy a gun if she wanted to. She's not even eighteen, and they don't sell to kids.", "input": "", "output": "I hope she doesn't have a gun..."}, {"instruction": "She doesn't. She couldn't. No way. Do you think? No, she wouldn't have the balls to. Well, I'm not going to concern myself with that trash. She got just what she deserved--trash should be escorted to the curb!", "input": "", "output": "Well, maybe it would be wise to be a little extra cautious, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I guess. Damn! She really bugs the hell out of me sometimes. Shit! I can't think about her right now, you know?", "input": "", "output": "All right. Tell me where you got the fat lip."}, {"instruction": "Huh? Oh that! Well, we can thank that nut case Sharon for that.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon hit you?"}, {"instruction": "No. Ha! Ha! You act like you know her or something. Jeez, dude, get a hold of yourself. No, Tony gave me the fat lip. But it was because of Sharon and her big fat loose-lipped mouth. And don't say: \"I told you so.\"", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it seems she told Tony what I said, and he got mad just like you warned me he would. He called and asked me to come over, he said he wanted to talk. When I got there, he didn't just come right out and say what was on his mind. He was really pissing me off--he was acting like a total jerk. But then he went, \"Why did you tell her I have HIV? What are you so fucking jealous of her for?\" And I was like, \"I'm not jealous!\" And before I knew it, I was on my back on the floor, and he was on top of me. We were rolling around and knocking the furniture around. It all happened so fast. It was like lightning. So anyway, a few things were broken, and the place was a total mess. We ended up just sitting there on the floor and out of breath, looking at each other. And then all of a sudden, something clicked and we both busted out laughing. There I was with a bitten tongue and lip, and I was bleeding. Tony had chipped a tooth and got pretty banged up, too. He even had a couple of bloody scrapes on him. But we were both laughing our heads off. You're looking at me in that way you do...", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Come on, Doc, you know. It's like you want to say, \"I told you so.\" Don't you? Okay, just say it then.", "input": "", "output": "I did try to warn you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know, but I didn't listen--typical me. Sometimes I get an idea, and I just have to go with it for some reason regardless of whether it's right or wrong. I just can't help myself sometimes. But at least now everything is out in the open, and Tony knows where I stand, and I know where he stands. The bitch isn't going anywhere. If anything, this has probably brought them closer together. So it really backfired on me three times: once, when I told her; then when Tony and I had our little knock-down-drag-out fight; and now they're closer together than ever. Payback's a real motherfucker. And okay, you did try to warn me. I accept my defeat like a man. I just can't help but blame Sharon for the stupid fight, though. If she hadn't opened her big mouth...I guess I'm going to see her again sometime, and I hope I can maintain my cool when I do and not go off on her. I've got to be cool for Tony, that's what Cami said.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Cami. She said that I've got to be cool for Tony. It doesn't matter if I like Sharon or not; I've got to make it seem like I like her for Tony's benefit.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps that's not a bad idea."}, {"instruction": "I'll try to hold it back when I see her next time. Can we change the subject or something? I'm not really into talking about this anymore, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Earlier, you mentioned that Ralph is home from the hospital. How is he?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, they let him come home a few days ago. We have this nurse coming over to the house a few times a week so Ralph can get used to his...uh, his bag.", "input": "", "output": "Oh. He has a colostomy bag?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. That's bad, but they said it's only temporary. So anyway, Helga, the head nurse, came and steam-rolled the house. And then Edward showed up at the front door.", "input": "", "output": "Who's Edward?"}, {"instruction": "Ralph's ex. He's really his only ex. They were together a long time ago, and Ralph has always had this thing for him, even though they aren't together any more. Ralph must have called him while he was still in the hospital. But between Helga the head nurse and Edward the hurricane, I was thinking I may have to move into the art studio. Edward is such an old queen, and I hate old queens! He is a nurse, too. So he just comes in like a hurricane and takes over. He even tried to take over for Helga. He's like Mary the control freak or something. He's so frou-frou, too, such a sis, it's totally gross. So he wants to run everything, and he just brushes past me like I'm some street person...like I don't even exist. I mean, fuck me! I don't know how long I'll be able to last. And Ralph is such a big whiny-butt, he's totally milking it, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, try to step back for a moment and look at this in a different way. With the nurse coming over and Edward running things, it's not all in your lap. You said before just how difficult it was on you. So their help is a good thing."}, {"instruction": "I hadn't thought of it like that. It's not as if I can't or wouldn't do it, it's just...I don't know. It's like I still can't believe this. In a few weeks, when Ralph heals up some, they're going to start radiation and chemotherapy. How do I help with that? I'm totally useless in this.", "input": "", "output": "Not really. Take your time. Edward seems to want the responsibilities, so let him have them. You can help Ralph by being his friend and being there for him. There will come a time when he needs you or wants you to do something for him. But mainly, just treat him like you usually do. I think he'll appreciate that more than anything else. Try to avoid treating him like he's sick and needy. Help him out if he needs it."}, {"instruction": "I'll try, but with little Miss Edward buzzing around all the time...I don't know. It just really bugs me, all this upheaval. I thought I was through with that. Who knows how long this Edward person is going to be camping out in the extra bedroom? He even rearranged some of the furniture already, can you believe that? Dammit! I get so...I don't know, so weird about this. I'm thinking all these things: like what's going to happen to him?  Is he going to be in a lot of pain or discomfort? Am I going to be in the way or will he still want me around? How can I help him if I don't know what to do? I feel so helpless. It's like there's really nothing I can do.", "input": "", "output": "Just be there for him, Alex. Just be there and be his friend, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. But...", "input": "", "output": "I understand, Alex. It's not unusual to feel the way you do."}, {"instruction": "I just hope he doesn't start talking about that Hemlock Society stuff again. That would be just what I need to hear right now, you know? I can't even think...I don't want to think about Ralph as dying, but he is, isn't he? Wait! Don't answer that. I know he is. At least he might die, but...", "input": "", "output": "No one can answer that."}, {"instruction": "Well, I should be going now. I've got a lot to do at The Alliance. And Luke said he may show up tonight. So I'll see you later, okay?", "input": "", "output": "All right, Alex. I'll see you at the same time next week. Call me if things get out of hand or are too much for you to handle, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, okay. It's all right, dude. I'll be fine. Later!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, dude. I took your advice.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. What advice?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you know, about Ralph. Remember the thing you said about just being his friend and to treat him the way I normally do?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I remember. What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, after I thought about what you said, I sat down with Ralph and we had a talk. I told him that I'm totally freaked over this...over what's happening to him. I told him I worry that he's in pain sometimes and that he has to take all these pills. He's already taking a lot of shit--like fifty-seven pills a day for the AIDS-related stuff and all--and now he takes these pain killers because he has a lot of pain in his back. He says it's behind where the growth is. Anyway, he takes these pain killers, and I think Edward isn't really helping in this. I hate his name, \"Edward.\" He is such a sis and a major control queen. I am so lost here, dude. What were we talking about?", "input": "", "output": "You were telling me about the talk you had with Ralph."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, that's right. So anyway, I told him that I am worried big-time about him. Shit! I even walked the other night--remember how I used to do that? All night, I walked and walked. It was so foggy, my clothes were real damp and all the trees and bushes had little diamond droplets clinging and sparkling in the darkness. I felt like I was in the middle of a snow dream or something. I walked from our house on upper Market down Market, working my way to where the new Pacific Bell ball park is being built. Have you been over there lately? It's so totally different and real nice now, not at all like it used to be. Then I walked around and back through the Financial District. And eventually, I got to the Golden Gate Bridge and just sort of hung out at the girders that Roly and I used hang at. The fog has been thicker lately than it has been in a long time. Uh, we were talking about Ralph. Sorry, it's just that...I don't know. It's like it's all so unreal, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand. Please, go on."}, {"instruction": "So, I told Ralph that I feel helpless like I can't do anything for him even if I tried. I wouldn't know what to do or where to even begin, you know? So do you know what he said?", "input": "", "output": "What did he say?"}, {"instruction": "He said, \"There isn't anything you can do.\" He told me that he has Edward to take care of things right now and he's okay with that. He said that he wants me to continue to do the things I do, as if nothing was wrong. And I was like, \"How do I do that?\" I mean this is too big, too in my face. But he said that all he wants me to do is continue to cook dinner like I do and, of all things, to do the dishes. I was almost waiting for him to make that crack about me doing them in my underwear--remember when he asked me that in the hospital that time? But he didn't go there. So all he wants is for me to just continue along with my life and try not to worry about him. But I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "I know that sounds easier than it really is."}, {"instruction": "You're telling me? He and I were talking, and he really made me feel better. But then a couple of things happened. First, he got all serious--too serious--and I started to get all worried again. He said he needs to talk to me about something real important and he went over to close the bedroom door.", "input": "", "output": "What was it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I never got to find out--he didn't get a chance to start because Edward burst in saying that Ralph needs to take his meds and get some rest. And he said something like, \"Alex has a chore to do.\" And I was all like, \"What chore? Hello?\" What in the hell did that mean? So Edward shooed me out of the bedroom and gave Ralph his pills. And after Ralph got all settled, Edward came out with it. It was like a daytime soap opera or something, I couldn't believe my ears. Edward said that he knows what I am up to. He went, \"You're not the first street urchin Ralph has taken in.\" I was like, \"What?\" Who in hell does he think he is? And then--and this is the real killer here--Edward said to me that it's time to pack up my things and get out, move on. That was the chore. So, Doctor, you can pick your chin up out of your lap now.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't have to do anything! Ralph suddenly appeared out of the darkness, and his face was darker than the shadows on the wall. He said, \"No, you're wrong, Edward! This is Alex's home--now and after I'm gone, Alex stays.\" And then he looked me square in the eye and said, \"Don't go anywhere, Alex.\" I got chills all up and down my spine. Then he really went off. He started telling Edward, the little fucking sis, that he practically scared away the nurse that the doctor sent and how he didn't like that at all. And he was not pleased about the furniture being rearranged and told Edward to put everything back the way it was. Ralph said something like: \"All this reminds me of when we were living together--how nice you can be when you want something.\" And then Ralph wondered what Edward was up to.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'll say! He stopped totally short of throwing Edward out. But Ralph did tell him to stop the controlling bullshit. You should have seen that little chi-chi queen, the poor dear. Her mouth was turned upside down, and the sad little \"you caught me\" puppy-dog eyes...he was speechless. It was the only time since I've known Edward that he wasn't jabbering on about something, and it was so good. Ralph has got to be the coolest man alive. I hate that he has to be sick, I just totally hate it. He never said it like that before: \"my home.\" It was an unspoken thing between us until now. He never had to say it, because the way he treated me was all he needed to do to make me feel like it was my home, too. But it felt good to hear that right after Edward treated me like common trash, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like Ralph really cares a great deal about you."}, {"instruction": "I know. It feels good, but scary, too.", "input": "", "output": "Why scary?"}, {"instruction": "Well,  mainly it's because he may die on me, and that would be the story of my life, you know? Dammit! I just hate this! Uh, I'm sorry...it's just...", "input": "", "output": "There's no need to be sorry. You have good reasons to feel the way you do, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Oh, but I've got to tell you about what happened the next day. I think it was a full moon the following day. Anyway, I was in the kitchen, cooking and chopping some vegetables with my big knife, when chi-chi girl came frolicking in. Well, I just looked up at him unfazed as he lifted the lid off the pot on the stove--I wish the steam burned his pretty little face off or something. Well, he didn't say a word to me, as usual, but his eyes begun darting back and forth as I pulled a \"Piper Laurie\" on him.", "input": "", "output": "A what?"}, {"instruction": "A \"Piper Laurie.\" You know it's like in the movie \"Carrie?\" The girl gets all freaked because she's afraid the boys are going to come sniffing around like dogs. So she's chopping the vegetables by slamming down the blade hard and fast with random chops, and the vegetables are flying all over the place. Well, that's what I did--just like in the movie, with carrots shooting out all over the kitchen. And you should have seen Edward scurry out of there as fast as he could in his nervous Nellie fashion. I guess it's a safe bet that he won't be messing with me anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Because you were violently chopping vegetables?  Were you trying to physically intimidate him?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't hit him, although I wanted to before Ralph showed up the other night. Then another weird thing happened that very night, and it had nothing to do with Ralph or the sis.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I was painting in my studio, and like a blast of air, Tony rushed in. He was blabbering about Sharon--she got arrested or something. He was incoherent. I got him to slow down, and then he just froze up on me. I was trying to get him to tell me more, but he went, \"Never mind.\" And he knows how much I hate it when he does that--when he starts to say something and then thinks about it, stops in the middle of a sentence, and says: \"Never mind.\" It totally drives me wild! So he was doing his passive-aggressive thing, and I just went on painting while he sort of sat there all quiet. And then he pulled out a joint and lighted it. I haven't had an urge for it for some time, but that night, it looked real inviting...", "input": "", "output": "And did you?"}, {"instruction": "Of course I did, but I regretted it right away.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "When Tony got up to leave, he reached out to hug me. And before I could even understand what was happening, he had his tongue in my mouth and he was all feeling me up and down, grabbing me and shit. And he s pretty damn strong, too--it was hard to get him to stop. But I pushed him away and told him that it was not cool to try to force himself on me that way.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He said he always wanted to go there with me. But I was like, \"No, dude. This isn't going to happen between us.\" I told him he better go. I could tell he was on something, something other than the pot. He just wasn't right. It completely spanked me, you know? I was sitting there wondering what I did to make him do that. Was it me or was it the drug-thing?", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "I'm not mad at him or anything. I'm just totally perplexed by it.", "input": "", "output": "I think you handled yourself well, especially given that there were drugs involved. I'm glad that it didn't end in violence like your last confrontation with Tony."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'll tell you, that whole thing totally sobered me up. My high was completely gone after that. When I told Cami about it, she said I must have done something to get him excited. I told her that I think it was something I created, unintentionally.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Remember when I was thinking of ways to get rid of Sharon? One idea was for me to seduce Tony. But he came along and tried to seduce me! Talk about payback. Hey! Didn't we talk about this last time? We did. Oh well. Oh yeah, the other and final weird thing that happened in my life last week. Regina is in jail or juvie. I don't know which.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she went over to the museum where Cami works during the day. Cami volunteers as a tour guide or something. I guess Regina went in there and demanded to see Cami, but Cami wasn't even there that day. So when the guards told her she wasn't there, she whipped out a gun and started waving it around, acting the fool, totally blowing it. So they arrested her and took her away. Hopefully, they'll keep her locked up and toss out the key. Serves her right, the crazy bitch!", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad she didn't hurt anyone. She sounds like a troubled young woman."}, {"instruction": "You're such a diplomat, dude--\"a troubled young woman!\" But you're right, she's lucky the gun didn't accidentally go off and shoot someone.

Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "No parting words of advice?", "input": "", "output": "Take care of yourself, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, dude.", "input": "", "output": "How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "Well, did you ever feel like saying: \"Hey! Stop this ride, I want to get off!\" That's just how I've been feeling lately--I want to stop this ride and go get on another one, one less bumpy and with fewer ups and downs. My life is too crazy sometimes. Today, I wasn't even sure I would make it here.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Mainly it's because we have these visitors from Southern California--Mark's cousin Simon and his wife and kids. I almost got into it today with his wife. She's one of those born-again Christians. That bitch just knows entirely too much; at least she thinks she knows it all.", "input": "", "output": "What did she do?"}, {"instruction": "They got here yesterday. But as usual, no one told me ahead of time that they were coming, so I was surprised when Racyl and Rhea and these two other kids, twins, showed up at Ralph's door. My mom sent them over to surprise me and they did. Ralph didn't need the disturbance and neither did I--a lot of stuff with him has sort of fallen in my lap suddenly, but that's another story. So they just showed up, and I was like, \"Okay, what's up?\" So to make a long story short, these people are on their way up the coast to Oregon, and they decided to drop by. Mark and my mom thought it would be fun to surprise me and sent them over. I had to leave Ralph alone and go down to my mom's house. And the first thing that lady wanted was to know why I wasn't living with my family, as if it was any of her business. Mirdle is this social worker, like my social worker Marty.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So she was nosy and bossy. You should have heard her. And I thought my mom was a bossy bitch...but this one wrote the book on bossy. Anyway, Mirdle wanted to know why I was living with Ralph. And then when she realized I was gay...well, it totally went down the toilet from there. She stopped me as I was leaving, handed me this big envelope, and said that I should wait until I get home to open it.", "input": "", "output": "What was it?"}, {"instruction": "A magazine. It's put out by the Christian Coalition or something. I'm not really sure who puts it out. It's one of those zealous Christian-Republican-Southern-anti-abortion-always-got-a-cause organizations. It was titled \"Family Values\" and had a picture of three people, two women and a man. The quote at the bottom of the page read something like, \"How so-and-so, so-and-so, and so-and-so overcame homosexuality.\" Ralph thought I was having a coronary--I screamed so loud. I couldn't believe that this bitch--whom I just met--thought it was her right to try to fix me. On top of that, she included a handwritten list of bible study radio broadcasts for the local radio stations. Arggh! Oh my god, I couldn't believe the nerve...and Ralph was in hysterics over it, too. At first, he laughed and then, he got mad. He started to yell at me, saying that I should take that stuff back over to my mom's and shove that shit down the bitch's throat. And I was like, \"No!\" I thought that woman was just an ignorant bitch, she probably really truly believed that she was doing me a favor or something.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, I talked to Cami about it. And today, I went over to the house and saw Mirdle again. I told her right out that she was wrong and had no right. I told it to her like this: \"I know you think that you were helping me, but trying to change me would be like me coming into your house and trying to tell you to change your eye color.\" I used the same old line I always use. And Mirdle was like, \"But, but...\" I told her, \"But nothing!\" This woman would have had a heart attack if she had seen some of the stuff I've seen in my life. And I'm talking only about the stuff I've seen in the past few days. She has no clue at all, you know? Such ignorance, and she lives in California, too!", "input": "", "output": "People like Mirdle can be very frustrating."}, {"instruction": "I told her, \"Thank you, but I don't need your help, and I certainly don't want it. I know you mean well and all, but...\"", "input": "", "output": "I think you handled it well, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I came straight here from there. My mother stayed out of it, she probably found it amusing, knowing her. Mark kept his mouth shut because he knew I was right to say something. And his cousin Simon just sat there watching the whole thing as if he'd seen it all before. And I'd bet my last penny he had. She even said to me, \"God forgives.\" I was all, \"Gee, thank you very much. That's so important to me!\" Oh well. So, let's see...what else happened this week? I went to the G-Spot for this record release party. It was a very interesting experience.", "input": "", "output": "G-Spot?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's really a gay bar called the End-Up, but once a week they call it the G-Spot and it becomes a lesbiterian bar. Do you want to talk weird? It was a party celebrating the release of Stevie Nicks' box set, and they were handing out free CDs and posters--that was the only reason we went, for the free stuff. Events like that really attract some of the most fanatical fans. People were dressed up like her, in shawls and lace and stuff. I went with Cami. She is totally familiar with that place. She said that those women won't mind a guy being there. But I was probably the only guy in there, although I saw a bunch of people in drag sort of. Everywhere I looked, I saw these girls that looked like boys--short little boy haircuts and little boy clothes. But if all these women are attracted to women, then why don't they want to look like women? Why did they all want to look like boys? Cami said that they do that probably out of this unconscious need to contradict what the mainstream society says a woman should be.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "That sort of makes sense to me. But it was weird seeing all these girls dressed as boys. I caught myself almost cruising one of them until I realized I was looking at a girl. It was a different and odd sort of drag. I hadn't really paid attention to it before. And these two girls that Cami knew through Regina were there, dressed up like Stevie Nicks. They gave attitude to Cami as if she did something wrong. I thought it was because she was with me, but Cami said it was because Regina is a troublemaking little B-word.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So I got this cool promo CD of Stevie Nicks. Cami took the poster. And we were both happy. That night, I kept dreaming of Stevie Nicks and lesbiterians. I don't know if those dreams qualify as nightmares, but...", "input": "", "output": "The Stevie Nicks party clearly made an impact on you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, Stevie Nicks and lesbiterians are haunting me! Go figure. Some people say we create our own realities, I wonder what I did to create this? Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Ralph will begin his chemotherapy this week, and Edward is now gone. At least I think he's gone, and I hope it's for good.", "input": "", "output": "What happened to Edward?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the other day, I found this wild bird in the backyard--a baby Peregrine falcon. It had a broken wing.", "input": "", "output": "A falcon?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, they're all over this city. They nest in the tops of the taller buildings downtown, and they hunt for small rodents, even rabbits and stuff like that. I think they even eat ducks, too. Just because we're in a city, doesn't mean that wildlife doesn't exist here.", "input": "", "output": "That's true. So please go on about Edward."}, {"instruction": "So anyway, I ran into the house to call the Humane Society. And when I picked up the phone, Edward was talking to someone. I heard him say something like it won't be long before Ralph is gone and then everything will be his. It sounded as if Edward thought that Ralph was going to die any day now and that he would inherit Ralph's property. This time, the tables were finally turned. When he was finishing up the call, I spoke into the phone and said, \"Edward, I heard what you just said, and now I know what you are up to!\" He was in front of me in a flash. He begged me not to tell Ralph. He even hinted that I could have some of Ralph's stuff. But I just looked right through him, and he looked at me with daggers and his face went full white. I knew I had him by the balls. When the people from the Humane Society got there, I noticed Edward taking off in a hurry. Later, Ralph told me that things between him and Edward weren't working out and that he didn't really know what he was thinking by bringing him here. I guess he was hoping that things would be different between him and Edward. He said Edward probably won't be back. So, good riddance!", "input": "", "output": "I agree..."}, {"instruction": "Edward, the scum bag, was the one digging for gold, but he practically accused me of that! The guilty party is always the first one to speak up, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm not sure I'm very surprised by Edward's motives. His conduct towards you was unconscionable."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that old queen just brought trauma and drama into our lives--sashaying around like he owned the place! Jeez! I kind of wish Ralph had caught him, but it worked out either way. So now I'm helping Ralph out like Edward has been--I'm keeping track of his medication and stuff. I practically had to force feed him the other day. But he does his own damn bag, I'm not touching that, uh uh, no how, no way!", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you're able to take on such an active role in Ralph's care.  I know it must be very hard on you."}, {"instruction": "But it's cool. Ralph is easy enough to get along with, even though he's in a bad mood all the time now. But even his bad moods are better than my mom's good moods, so it's pretty easy still. Oh, the other day, I was walking down Castro Street after picking up a prescription for Ralph and I ran into--and I mean I literally ran into--this guy who looked a lot like Benny. We ran smack into one another, neither of us were looking where we were going. I looked at him and he looked at me, and my mouth dropped to the ground and my heart stopped. He smiled at me and said he was sorry. I muttered something and then just stood there staring at him as he walked away. He even turned around once and looked back at me again. He looked so much like him. They could have been twins. It was too weird. But they say everyone has their twin somewhere out there.", "input": "", "output": "I can imagine that must have been strange."}, {"instruction": "That's why I said earlier that I want this ride to stop so I can get off, you know? It's too much all of a sudden. I...well, I just can't seem to make sense of things sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "On the contrary, I think you're handling yourself and dealing very well, Alex."}, {"instruction": "You think so?", "input": "", "output": "I do."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It just keeps coming at me full speed...", "input": "", "output": "Such is life sometimes. I know how overwhelming it can seem."}, {"instruction": "That's for sure!

How are things going? Why did you sit down so carefully? Is there a problem?"}, {"instruction": "Some mean old lipstick lesbiterians got to me at Dore Alley on Sunday. I have welts on my ass and legs, and they still hurt.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I see."}, {"instruction": "So, my past came back to haunt me this week.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Remember that dude I beat up? The one whose face I messed up? The shit that landed me here in your office in the first place? Well, the police came by my mom's, looking for me.", "input": "", "output": "What did they want?"}, {"instruction": "He's dead.", "input": "", "output": "Dead?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, dead as a doornail. They found him inside this abandoned building around the corner from Ralph's bar. They went in to renovate it or something, and there he was. He'd been in there for about a year, according to the police.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "My first thought was of Benny and Roly. Remember? They chased him out of the bar after he head-butted me, and when they came back, they told me that I won't have to worry about him any more. And boy, were they right. Only I didn't know how right they were until now. I didn't really think they would do something like that, but I guess they did. It took me a minute to realize that I was actually thinking of some way to protect Benny, but then I came to my senses. I told police the truth--Benny and Roly chased the guy out of the bar after he did that to me, and that was the last time I ever saw the dude. I guess they're talking to Benny about it right now. I don't know. But this would explain more what happened with Roly.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Explain why he went crazy the way he did. It was probably heavy on his mind. I know it would've weighed heavy on my mind. But this got me to thinking about what happened between me and that dude. I remember it all too clear: how I beat his face in and why. It's like I'm so totally different now than then, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I agree. You have made great strides since then, Alex. But..."}, {"instruction": "You can tell how bugged I am about it, huh? I'm bugged by it. Well, it was bad enough that I was doing...uh, tricking...doing the things that we do the best. Ha! Ha! Ha! But it was like I was expected to do it. I should have gotten the money from him up front, but I didn't. And then he didn't want to pay, and I was so...uh, I don't know. He laughed at me and called me \"white trash.\" So I told him, \"Fuck you!\" Just like that: \"Fuck you, dude!\" And he backhanded me, twice even. And then I...uh, I went off on him. You know the rest. It was like a bad dream, a real bad dream.", "input": "", "output": "Are you a murder suspect?"}, {"instruction": "I think the police were looking at me as if I did it, but then I told them about Benny and Roly. They were able to check with a few other people at the bar that what I said was really true. So, I don't know. I didn't do it, that's fosheezala.", "input": "", "output": "Huh?"}, {"instruction": "Fosheezala. You know...god, do I have to explain everything to you? For sure. It means \"for sure,\" dude.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes you old dudes really are a trip. But I have an alibi and it checks out. So I think they are looking at Benny for answers now.

What a fucking trip! After all this time...and do you want to talk about trippy shit? The other night, I thought I'd drop over to Tony's and I almost died. They were in drag.", "input": "", "output": "They?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, Sharon and him. And drag queens really freak me out. Drag queens scare me the way clowns scare some people. It's creepy, you know? Girls with Adam's apples. Brrr! It gives me chills and stuff. But there they were on their way out the door. I asked this tall blond woman where Tony was, and she...I mean, he spoke. It was Tony! He was wearing this weird white mesh mini skirt and this bright pink g-string underneath with a matching pink high heel shoes. It looked like he might have shaved his legs, too. That blond wig was all long and curly, and it really changed him into another person. He looked so...so different! But when Tony's voice came out of this tall, beautiful whore, my legs almost gave out on me. It was so completely out there, so weird! Then Sharon came out dressed as a man, like Alicia Silverstone in that Aerosmith video--in a suit and tie. I was stunned and couldn't help myself from looking her up and down a few times. And our eyes locked into each other's for a split second. That bitch can see right into my mind; she knew exactly what I was thinking.", "input": "", "output": "What were you thinking?"}, {"instruction": "She has really changed Tony. Or maybe I should say that Tony is totally gullible. He lets her reinvent him, and it's sort of like how Tim controlled him, too. That's how he became Tim's slave. Tony changes to suit other people's desires. That's really not right, you know? And she shouldn't be doing this either. It's so obvious that Tony is like that, and she is totally taking advantage of that...of him. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like it was a disconcerting experience for you."}, {"instruction": "It was discon-something, that's for sure, dude! So weird. I don't think Tony has ever done something like that before. But she saw me, saw my eyes. And the look in her eyes was like she knew how I felt about it--how disgusted I was with them...with her. It's not like I could hide it or anything. So off they went to a party or something, I don't know. With those lesbiterians last week all looking like little boys, and then Tony dressed as a blond whore, plus all those men and women at Dore Alley dressed up in leather--yet another form of drag--well, my head's spinning. I had more dreams that registered as nightmares. I have to remind myself that this is not the world--these messed up people are not the world, not the real world.", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "It's like a mental illness or something, isn't it? It has to be.", "input": "", "output": "Not necessarily. Just because a man..."}, {"instruction": "Just because a man is into wearing stokings, high hills, and panties...it's sick, I'm telling you, Doc. Sick.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't we move on, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Well...oh yeah, I went with Cami to her cousin's funeral...I mean wedding. We went to a wedding this past weekend. Funeral, wedding--same difference! Might as well get buried when you get married! Ha! Ha! Ha! Oh well, it was down in Belmont, right next to that hospital that Roly stayed in. It was real elegant, in this lush garden setting. But things took a bizarre turn.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, two ways. First, we learned during the ceremony that these people were Christian--born-again Christians. There was all this religious crap they said and did. It was too weird. I can't seem to get away from those people! So I leaned over and asked Cami when they were going to try to convert us. She laughed out loud right in the middle of the ceremony. This old woman sitting next to us sort of stuck to Cami and me from then on. Now she was a trip! She thought we were a couple. She was like eighty-three years old and drinking all this champagne. She said, \"I'm eighty-three years old, and I am not passing up any more parties, damnit!\" She got to the champagne before anyone else could--even before the bride and groom did--and she sucked it down like it was water. And later they did the bouquet toss, and guess who caught it?", "input": "", "output": "The elderly woman?"}, {"instruction": "You're warm, but no cigar! Cami caught it. The old lady elbowed me in the ribs and winked at me. She said, \"You're next sweetheart!\" I was all, \"If only you knew.\" She was such a trip. People are a trip.", "input": "", "output": "You've been spending a lot of time with Cami lately."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, so? She and I are buds. Luke has been working out of the country lately, and I hardly get to see him, so...", "input": "", "output": "Why is he out of the country?"}, {"instruction": "Duh, hello? He's a fashion model, remember? This is the time of year when the big fashion houses are showing their fall lines, and he's under contract to this designer, and they do all the runway shows. Right now, they are running shows back to back. He's real busy. He's pretty good at it, too, so natural. He calls every other day, and we talk for an hour or so. But I'm beginning to get tired of him being away so much, most of the time lately. I hardly get to see him even when he's here. And he was saying that his agent wants him to move to New York. I was all, \"Whatever.\" If he does, I'm not following him.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what he wants you to do?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Probably. But I won't and I told him so. Cami said that the reason Luke and I get along so well is because he's only around part-time. She pointed out our hot-and-cold attitudes toward each other.", "input": "", "output": "Is that how you are together?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. I guess we are. You have to remember how we met--I was working that Macy's Passport show last year, and Beylund wanted to help me get into modeling, and I punched out Luke because he was taunting me.", "input": "", "output": "I remember."}, {"instruction": "How many people do you know who get a boyfriend after punching him out first? He taunts me still sometimes, but it's all pretty good-natured, I guess. But sometimes, I get irritated with him and don't want to be around him because that unending teasing gets old. He can be relentless, and I can get moody.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, speaking of relentless, Regina is out of jail. The other day, when I was at the wedding, someone rang the doorbell, but Ralph didn't get up to answer it since he wasn't expecting anybody. Ralph said that whoever it was kept ringing and ringing. And then the ringing turned into pounding. And then this woman started yelling out my name saying things like: \"I know you're in there, Alex!\" I know it was Regina. That bitch is certifiable! Eventually, she went away. But not before she turned over some of the potted plants along the stairs outside and broke the pots. She is crazy.", "input": "", "output": "Why didn't Ralph call the police?"}, {"instruction": "What planet do you live on? The San Francisco police wouldn't come to the house just because some crazy bitch is knocking on your door. They don't have time for that. Plus, Ralph isn't like that. He wouldn't want her to get into trouble. He's too nice sometimes. I probably would have gone outside and chased her down the stairs with the fireplace poker or something. I wish she would crawl back under the rock from where she came and leave me the hell alone.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps it might be a good idea to make the police aware of the situation. This girl sounds dangerous."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, right! She's about as dangerous as that old woman at the wedding!", "input": "", "output": "Seriously, Alex. She was arrested for brandishing a loaded gun. I think you need to call the police if she comes back. And don't chase her down the stairs with the fireplace poker or any other weapon."}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "I'm not kidding, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I...ha! Ha! You really got your shorts all twisted up, dude! Get a hold of yourself. I guess I'll talk to Ralph about it. We'll see. Wow! Look at the time! We have really run over today.", "input": "", "output": "We have, haven't we? Well, Alex, take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "All right, man. See you then.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, dude. Here you go!", "input": "", "output": "What's this?"}, {"instruction": "Those are my truffles. They're real fresh, I just made them. It's the first time I've made them since Thanksgiving, when Aunt Sofie died.", "input": "", "output": "Oh yes, I remember."}, {"instruction": "I thought about her while I made them. I hope you like them. Once you taste one, you won't want to share them with anyone.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Alex. Let me try one of these now--they look so professional.  Wow! These are fabulous.  I'm very impressed, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I thought you'd like them.", "input": "", "output": "I had no idea you were so accomplished.  You're right, they do make feel like I should be selfish. I like your T-shirt. It's Stevie Nicks, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah! Cami and I went to her concert down at the Shoreline the other night. It was so incredible! Other than the religious fanatic zealous sons of bitches that were there, it was great.", "input": "", "output": "More religious fanatics?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, dammit! I can't seem to get away from them; no matter where I go these days, there they fucking are! As we came walking down the sidewalk to the front gates, I noticed these two guys holding these huge signs. As I got closer, I could read them. I don't really remember exactly what they had written on them, but it was basically the same old \"repent and you shall be saved\" bullshit. But this one guy was yelling stuff like, \"Stevie Nicks is a witch!\"", "input": "", "output": "A witch?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah! And a whore!", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I had more than enough by then, so I walked straight over to the guy, and he looked at me all innocent. And I said, \"Fuck you, asshole, you don't even know what you are talking about!\" He started to come towards me fast, saying something about Jesus. And I just swung my foot around and pushed him backwards, and he fell on his ass. Quite a few people cheered when I did that. And one girl came up and kicked the guy saying something like, \"No one says something like that about Stevie Nicks and gets away with it, you fucking bastard!\" He looked so stunned. When he started to get up, I told him he better stay down and keep his mouth shut. By then security arrived, but I was able to disappear with Cami back into the crowd. Other than that, the show was fantastic.  And wow, the stage was set beautifully, with these long drapes cascading down all over and a huge lace-trimmed fan opened across the back of the stage. She looked fantastic. Did you know she is fifty years old? Man, she is even older than you are, but she looks great. Uh, not that you don't look great, but she is fifty and she still looks great. That's what I meant.", "input": "", "output": "I got it, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Uh, sorry, that didn't come out right. So anyway, Stevie Nicks did all the songs that she hadn't done live before. She just kicked right into it, totally rocked the whole place. Everyone was standing during the entire show, and I just sang out loud--I knew every word. This guy next to me was looking at me. It was obvious he came only because of the girl he was with. He was probably wondering about me, but I just couldn't help myself--I sang along with her. I just love her so much! Then she sang \"Rose Garden,\" and she sang this verse that brought tears to my eyes. It made me think about...guess who? Benny! It's not as if he hasn't been on my mind every single day again lately. The verse went, \"One day, I turned around, and you no longer loved me. In my life there's been a big change...\" And it hurt my heart a little when I heard it, I don't know, I wish he would just go away. I mean, just when I thought my teenage crisis was over, it's like...I thought I had a chance at starting to rebuild my life from scratch and then...then all these reminders keep coming up. It totally bites.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. Do you want to talk about these reminders?"}, {"instruction": "Well, to start with, the police came over again about that guy.", "input": "", "output": "What did they want?"}, {"instruction": "They wanted to tell me...they asked me more stupid questions. These were the same damn questions as before, the ones I answered seventeen times already. And this is the thing that has brought it all right back in my face! It really has got me all twisted, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I was starting to get impatient and snappish with the cop. You'd think I would have learned by now.", "input": "", "output": "What happened. Alex?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing! It's just that...well, he just wouldn't let up. I was telling him all the same things. But it was like he wanted to get me all tangled up, like he was testing me to see if I would crack and tell him something different from before, I guess, I don't know. So finally, I told him flat out that I thought Benny did it because of what happened at the bar. Oh, and the bar...now Ralph thinks they are doing some investigation on his bar, like who they let in and how good they are at carding people. Ralph isn't pleased.", "input": "", "output": "Why does he suspect there's an investigation of his bar?"}, {"instruction": "He said the guy who manages the place told him that some people have been coming around with young-looking guys. He said they had to throw out more people lately for being underage. But anyway, Ralph said that I am forbidden from going in that place. Forbidden! And as soon as he said that, I got this strange urge...", "input": "", "output": "You didn't go there?"}, {"instruction": "No. Ha! Ha! Ha! You should have seen the look on your face, dude! You are so funny sometimes, and I lured you right into that, too!", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "Sue me. Oh yeah! Speaking of sue...wait! I didn't finish telling you about the police.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, do go on."}, {"instruction": "Well, when I told that cop that I thought Benny did it, he agreed. Yes, that's right, he agreed with me. Here's where it gets interesting. He said they need me as a witness so they can pin it on him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm a fucking witness again. I can't believe it. I got kind of pissed and asked him, \"After all this shit, all these questions, you knew all along what you wanted from me?\" I yelled at him and then I just broke.", "input": "", "output": "You broke? What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I fell apart. Right there, in front of the guy, I fell totally into pieces, crying my eyes out like a baby. I mean...shit! I'm sorry, but this is so overwhelming, you know? After a minute or so of crying, I just started laughing out loud. The cop must have thought I was insane--which I am--but he probably thought I was completely berserk, you know? I went through a whole range of feelings in just a matter of seconds. I'm all...when am I going to learn?", "input": "", "output": "Huh?"}, {"instruction": "When am I going to learn to get rid of all this shit? I'm too young to be having constant crisis and all this baggage, you know? My life shouldn't be this complicated. It's...it's...uh, it's really getting to me.", "input": "", "output": "What were you thinking when you went through that rush of emotion?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I was thinking about him, about Benny. He used to say things to me like he loved me; and I would one day live in the cottage in his backyard, and then we would be together all the time. He complemented me and made me feel good about myself. And when things were going great for us--or for him, I don't know the difference anymore--he made me feel like I was the most important person. No one else has ever shown that much interest in me, not like him. And I miss that more than anything else. I miss him.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "And the drugs I ran and the tricks I did...I did for him. I did it because I thought that those were the things that would make him happy with me. I know I probably shouldn't be missing him...and after everything that has happened...", "input": "", "output": "Alex, perhaps you miss the idea of Benny more than you miss the reality of that relationship."}, {"instruction": "Hmm? The idea of him...", "input": "", "output": "Yes. It's easy to idealize Benny now, when he's gone. But you have to remember that those things he wanted you to do and the things he did with you were wrong and very damaging in the long run. If this had been a relationship based on love rather than tricking and drug running, you may have had an easier time getting through it. I think there were some good things about your relationship with Benny, but the bad far outweighed the good, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "But then, why can't I stop thinking about him? Why haven't I learned anything by now? Plus, there's that guy...", "input": "", "output": "Who?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know his name, yet. I think I told you about him before. It's the guy who looks like Benny. Well, the day I went to Dore Alley, I saw him again. I was standing in line, waiting for the bathroom. When I turned around, there he was right behind me in line. He was wearing this body harness and a cod-piece. He looked hot! I guess he noticed the look on my face, and he tried starting up a conversation. But I couldn't hear anything he was saying.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was not because of any loud music or anything like that. It was because he looked so damn much like Benny. It was like he's a mirror image of him, a little younger maybe. And that's been on my mind ever since. I even had a very...uh, a very vivid and erotic dream about him.", "input": "", "output": "Would you tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "In my dream, we were still at Dore Alley. He followed me into the bathroom stall. We totally went for it. I feel kind of guilty about it for some reason. He came in and then we were in each other's arms. And before I knew it, he was undoing his cod-piece. And then all of a sudden, I couldn't believe my eyes--I never saw anything quite so...uh...well, I guess you don't really need to know the details, but it was so real. In my dream, I remember him calling me by name, but I didn't know his name. What really stands out about this dream for me is that I didn't even think to call him Benny, which is good I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps. He really looks that much like Benny to you?"}, {"instruction": "He does. It's too bizarre, especially since we keep running into each other. Oh yeah, before I forget, Ralph got a letter from a lawyer the other day. Regina is trying to sue Ralph.", "input": "", "output": "What for?"}, {"instruction": "For money, what else?", "input": "", "output": "No, I mean why is she suing him?"}, {"instruction": "She says she got injured while on his property--something about Ralph not maintaining his house or something. Ralph has the most perfect, upkept house in the city. Ralph told his lawyer about the damage she did when she broke all those potted plants and shit. Then Regina's lawyer came back saying that the plants were a nuisance and caused her to fall down the steps and impale her hand on the spikes coming out of the iron gate at the bottom as she tried to break her fall.", "input": "", "output": "Did she call nine-one-one?"}, {"instruction": "That's what I asked. No! The bitch is too stupid. She probably needs to call four-one-one to get the number for nine-one-one! But can you believe the nerve of her? Ralph is fighting it. I think he said that the lawyer she hired is some sleaze who tried to sue him before when a drunk fell off one of the platforms in the bar, where he wasn't supposed to be in the first place. Ralph said that the simple fact that he has a gate at the bottom of the stairs will save him--it's called trespassing. She had no business coming up the stairs in the first place, she could have just rung from the street, like a normal person is supposed to do. But she isn't normal. The fucking bitch! I hope she did impale herself on something. She needs to impale her brain. And this is just what Ralph needs since he started chemo.", "input": "", "output": "He has? How is that going for him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, other than refusing food pretty much completely, he says he feels okay. They are putting him on smaller doses than normal because of his already compromised immune system. But at least I have the house under control--all the laundry is caught up with, the dishes are clean, and Ralph's cats are well-fed. So other than the normal insanity in my life, everything else is going along at a rapid-fire pace. Now, if I can just get to sleep without dreaming about Benny or his twin...I know--I can tell by the look on your face that we are out of time.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. I admire you for all the assistance and support you're giving to Ralph. I know how challenging something like that can be."}, {"instruction": "It's not so hard, but thanks, dude!", "input": "", "output": "Now I'm afraid we are out of time. Keep hanging in there, and if you need anything, please call."}, {"instruction": "All right, see you later, man.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Doc.", "input": "", "output": "How are you this week?"}, {"instruction": "Tired. Real tired. Ralph has finished his first round of chemo, and he's been somewhat difficult.", "input": "", "output": "I imagine that's quite stressful."}, {"instruction": "Not for me, not really. Well, maybe a little--he has been in a bad mood lately, aside from being nauseated most of the time. I tried to make a joke--I told him that this nausea is his morning sickness: he doesn't have cancer, he's just pregnant! But Ralph just got up and ran into the bathroom and hurled his guts out for the tenth time that day. Normally, he would have laughed at a comment like that. But, other than the nausea, he's doing better than I expected. Plus, the doctors took some blood just the other day, and they said the chemo is doing what it's supposed to do. So that's good news.", "input": "", "output": "That is good news. What happens next?"}, {"instruction": "Well, after his body has time to recover from this round of chemo, they will start him on the second round. He doesn't seem fazed by it anymore. He actually put on a few pounds, even with all that hurling. He drinks a lot of that Ensure stuff. Oh yeah. Remember when he kept trying to talk to me but we were rudely interrupted by Edward all the time? Somehow, I think Edward knew what Ralph was planning to do and was trying to stop it.", "input": "", "output": "Are you talking about suicide?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really. Ralph told me that if it gets real bad--if it gets too much for him--then he wants to do it. But that's not what I'm talking about. He told me that he wants me to have the house and everything in it and the cars, too. I was all...I don't want any of it. I want him to get better, to keep his stuff, to stay alive. I don't want him to die. I don't want him to bag on me.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "All of a sudden, all these people are coming over to see Ralph. And it's like...it's...well, it scares me. It makes it even more real somehow. Everyone is so concerned for him, and it makes me think that he really is going to die on me. And then what will I do? I don't know if I can handle that right now, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Try not to project too far into the future, Alex. The future will be what it will be.  I have a sense that you feel very helpless when it comes to Ralph's sickness. Stay in the now.  Remain centered in the present and keep your mind on what's necessary. Don't spend too much time thinking about \"what ifs.\""}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. But lately, it's either the past or the future that's bugging me. One of Ralph's friends brought over some girly magazines for him, only it was the kind with boys instead of girls. It made me remember something that Benny said one time. He suggested that I should do that--I should get into porn.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Benny told me that I have the body to do it. At the time, I thought of it as a complement--I looked good enough to do that, to be on film. But knowing what I know now, knowing that he was taping me while we were...uh, when we were together...I get so angry at him. It made me feel dirty and totally used, like I was an object or something. And then...well, I don't know if I imagining this but I think Benny told me that he did a few movies himself when he was younger. I know he knew a lot of people in that business. When I think of how close I came to getting into that business, I get scared. And then I get all...I get so pissed again! And do you know what his argument was? It was something like this: \"Anybody who is remotely self-aware and with even half a brain should be pushing the envelope as far as they can, so long as they aren't hurting someone else.\" It was an almost convincing argument. This world is so backward, people are so marginal. Everyone is too busy watching TV, or listening to garbage on the radio, or surfing the web. Nothing is real or true anymore. It's all phony, you know? It's all so contrived. That's why pushing the envelope makes so much sense to me.", "input": "", "output": "I understand how you could feel that way..."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, and another thing. My mom called the other day. She got a visit from the people at social services. It seems that bitch, Mirdle, my cousin's wife, called child protective services on us or something. They showed up at the house last week, asking all these questions about me and where I really live. Lucky for me, my mom is fast on her feet.", "input": "", "output": "What did she tell them?"}, {"instruction": "She explained that Ralph is a close family friend and I take care of him because he's sick. They went away satisfied for now, but I bet we will hear from them again. Mirdle. What kind of a name is that anyway? Can you believe the nerve of that bitch? Now I want to slap her silly, you know?", "input": "", "output": "That was a close call."}, {"instruction": "Yes, it was too close! I hope that Simon and Mirdle come back for a visit on their way back to Southern California--I want to give her a piece of my mind. I think my mom wants to rip her a new asshole, too. The last thing my mom wants is for me to move back into the house with them. And it's the last thing I want, too. Why do people have to meddle in my life like that? Oh, did I tell you what that cop told me about that dude who died?", "input": "", "output": "No. What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the coroner--or whoever it is that checked him out--decided that there wasn't enough evidence, that it was too circumstantial...basically, there isn't enough concrete evidence to pin his death on Benny and Roly. The guy had a serious fracture to his skull, and that was what killed him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So now, I wonder if his head-butting me is what did him in--the fracture was right on his forehead.", "input": "", "output": "I guess that's possible. But I don't think you should dwell on that too much. There could be multiple explanations for the fracture which have nothing to do with you. Are they closing the case?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so, I don't know really. But he head-butted me pretty damn hard. Remember? I got knocked out, and I had that big bruise on my forehead that took a long time to heal. Plus, I kept getting those headaches for a week or two afterwards.", "input": "", "output": "I remember. I was quite concerned about you. But really, you have other real concerns. There's no reason to add to them. And I'm glad that this may be over."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think so. Now if I can just get Benny out of my mind...I'm ready for that to be over too now, you know? The other day, Cami and I went to Baker Beach. I was lying back in the sun, and she was sitting up watching the surf. And then she went, \"Would you just look at the scum floating out there?\" So I sat up and looked around. And the first thing that came out of my mouth was, \"Dammit girl, you silly bitch, what are you talking about? I don't see Benny floating around out there!\" She nearly died laughing, and so did I. The only thing I can do now is to try to joke about it.", "input": "", "output": "That's a start."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...well, I guess. So the next thing I knew, Cami took me to see this girl she knows. Her name is Clotilde. She's a real gypsy and does Tarot readings for a living. She did mine for free. Keep in mind that this girl doesn't know me at all. So she laid out the cards on the table, and kind of twirled her hair with her fingers, and told me that this is a good time to start something new. Now, I don't know if I really believe in that stuff, but she was telling me things that really blew me away.", "input": "", "output": "What did she tell you?"}, {"instruction": "She said that the thing that is holding me back is this person in my past. A man. She said that this man had good intentions and probably really loved me but he misguided me and unintentionally held me back from my life. She told me the past is over and done and that now is the time to close that book--I should start a new book, with clean white pages. Well, we know who she was talking about, right? Benny.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How did that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it was a trip, you know? How could those cards tell her something like that? Later, I asked Cami if she told her what to say, but she insisted she didn't. When Clotilde told me those things, I kind of saw it, too.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Now is the time for me to try to close this part of my life, once and for all.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I think it's a really good idea, but the big question is how? I had a dream with Benny in it again that very night. He just showed up and was scruffy looking, unshaven. But he had this smile on his face that could melt the hardest heart. I don't know. I know it's not over, but somehow I felt better. It was like Clotilde gave me permission to move on with my life or something. Do you know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do."}, {"instruction": "But...", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I don't know. I guess it's easier said than done. He was the whole world to me. And then one day, all of a sudden, he just stopped being there for me. And I don't think I'll ever really understand what happened. And I tried so hard to make him change his mind. I guess you can't really make someone do something they don't want to do.", "input": "", "output": "That's true."}, {"instruction": "He never told me why...maybe it's not really about understanding. Maybe it's just about moving on.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. That's just what Cami said, too. So now I have to get to a point where it's okay if I don't understand. Does that make any sense?", "input": "", "output": "It makes sense, Alex. Trust your instincts."}, {"instruction": "So I just have to go with whatever happens in my heart and mind?", "input": "", "output": "I think you should try to follow your heart..."}, {"instruction": "Well, I won't say it's over just yet. I don't want to jinx myself. Tony seems to be good at putting the past behind him. I should talk to him about how he did it. I haven't seen him since that scary drag queen scene with what's-her-name. I wonder what kind of trouble he's gotten himself into? You know, I think I'll stop by his place on my way home. We're pretty much done here for today, aren't we?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, we are out of time. So, I'll see you next week, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Talk to you later, man.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex. Take care."}, {"instruction": "It's not a look. Look closer. It's my lower lip; it's swollen. I kind of have a fat lip, and it makes me look like I'm pouting. Everyone's been asking me about it.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "You probably think I'm a klutz or something--I'm always getting hurt.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that. Tell me what happened, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's a long story.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, go on."}, {"instruction": "Well, this happened last weekend, and I'm not making any of this up, okay? This has been the weirdest, wildest week of my life, and you know this isn't my first trip around the block! So anyway, it all started really with Tony.", "input": "", "output": "You two didn't fight again, did you?"}, {"instruction": "No, the fat lip story doesn't really have anything to do with him, but the bizarre week I had does. Last week, I told you that I was going over to see Tony to talk to him about how he got over the stuff with Tim, remember? When I got to his house, he didn't answer. But I could hear the TV on real loud, so I went around to the side where I could look through the window and see if he was in. There he was, just sitting there like a zombie, all curled up with his legs to his chest. I tried to get his attention, but he wouldn't look at me. So I went to the back and went inside through the back door. When I got a closer look at him, I could tell he had been crying--his face was all puffy, and his eyes were real red. The place was a total mess. It turns out that what's-her-name is gone, finally.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Sharon is gone? Do you know what happened?"}, {"instruction": "I can't get him to talk much, really. He just sits, staring into space most of the time. All I know is sometime between that cross-dressing thing they did and now, she just stopped going over there and stopped calling. I don't really care what happened between them, as long as that drug-addled little bitch is gone. She was bad news. Who knows? Maybe she became one of those vegetarian, anti-abortion, conservative, religious fanatic zealots and is going around trying to convert people!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But Tony is so broken up over this he won't even leave the house. I had to go out and get him some food so he won't starve to death. And when I started to leave him the first time, he screamed out and just started crying. It's real sad. He must have really become attached to her. Why, I'll never know! And the worst part of it is that he doesn't know what happened. He thinks he did something wrong and feels real guilty. I don't know...I can't believe how people are these days. They treat each other as if they are disposable, like you can just throw someone out of your life or something. It kind of made me think about Benny, too. Shit! Everything makes me think of him. Sometimes, I wonder if things would change if we stayed together, but who knows? Well, enough of that. Oh, and I never found out how Tony got over the abuse that Tim put him through.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So Ralph is doing better and eating again pretty regularly. And there's no more nausea for now, which is a good thing. This was weird, though. One of his friends died. His name was Tobias, and he was married to the same woman for fifty-two years. I think it's a goddamned miracle or something, you know?", "input": "", "output": "That is a long time."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, really! So anyway, he was like a mentor to Ralph, I think. They were real close, and he was sick for a long time with bone cancer. For the last four months, he really suffered. So it was more of a relief to see him go than anything else. But Ralph is pretty sad over his death anyway--I can tell even though he tries to hide his feelings. Anyway, we were at their house the night before the funeral, and these real weird things happened. First, we were all sitting around the kitchen table when we heard a noise in the hall. His daughter Ginny went out to look because no one else was in the house except for us. When she went out there, the cover from the light fixture on the ceiling popped off and fell to the floor, right at her feet. According to her, Tobias was the only one who ever turned on that light. Brrr! I'm getting chills all over again just talking about it. Then, a little later, the toilet flushed, all by itself, and not just once, but a few times. I looked at it, and the chain inside had come loose, but it was such strange timing. But the most bizarre part was the airplane.", "input": "", "output": "The airplane?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's this clock radio thing he had. He was a pilot, and this toy was a replica of an airplane he flew. Well, the darned thing came on all by itself--the propellers spun around, and the lights were flashing. All that stuff really spooked me--a real life ghost! I mean, you do the math.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds pretty strange, but coincidences do happen."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, whatever. You think what you want, but I saw it all with my own eyes--they have his ghost now. Ginny said if that shit keeps up, she's out of there. I think she might be older than you, but I bet you would really like her. Maybe I can fix you two up.", "input": "", "output": "Uh, thanks, Alex, but no. That's not necessary."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I see. Do you already have a girl?", "input": "", "output": "This isn't something that we..."}, {"instruction": "Do you mean you got a boyfriend? Doc! I couldn't tell! What a surprise. You're one of us!", "input": "", "output": "No, no! That's not what I meant. Alex, we are supposed to be talking about you, not about me."}, {"instruction": "It's okay, dude, you can talk to me. We've known each other a long time now, and I just realized that I don't know anything about you except what you do for a living. So which is it? A boy or a girl?", "input": "", "output": "Like I said, we are here to talk about what's going on with you. So please, let's get back on track, okay?"}, {"instruction": "All right, dude, if you insist.", "input": "", "output": "I do."}, {"instruction": "So, where were we?", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you tell me how you got the fat lip?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah. That! You know, if it weren't for Cecil, I probably wouldn't be here right now. I'd probably still be trying to explain things to the police.", "input": "", "output": "The police are after you again?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not for the reasons you are thinking. The other day, I went over to Walgreen's to pick up a couple of prescriptions for Ralph. And I thought I was so lucky because I got a parking place so close to the store, too.", "input": "", "output": "You were driving? Alex, you don't have your driver's license yet."}, {"instruction": "So tell me something I don't already know, dude! With Ralph being sick, sometimes I have to drive. Anyway...damn! I forgot where I was. Oh yeah. Anyway, I went inside and got his prescriptions. As I was walking out, suddenly, Regina was there right in my face. And before I could react, she sucker-punched me in the mouth. That's how I got the fat lip. But when she punched me, I was caught so off guard that I fell backward and knocked over a rack, spilling all its contents to the ground. Then the crazy bitch splashed something on me, some liquid--I think it was Pepsi because, later, it was real sticky. And then, in like slow motion, she lighted a match with this big sadistic smile on her face. She said, \"If this was gasoline, I'd be able to light you on fire right now.\" And then she started laughing. So I got up and started to chase her. She darted out into the street and...well, she was history!", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "You wish, dude! I was just kidding about the history part. You know you get that look you get---that all twisted all too serious look---it's too funny! I couldn't resist, dude. No, but really, she did run out into the street, and she kind of got clipped by one of those new VW Bugs. So she fell down and cracked open her head and got all bruised up pretty bad. It was so cool!", "input": "", "output": "What happened then?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the police and paramedics came and whisked her away. Then this guy pointed at me and yelled, \"He did it! He pushed her!\" And I was all...I was just standing there kind of paralyzed. It all happened so fast. I didn't even realize that I had blood on my lip. But then this girl said, \"No, he didn't. I saw everything. She tried to light him on fire!\" I was like, \"What the fuck is this anyway?\" The guy from the store was there, insisting that someone had to pay for all the broken stuff. And the cops were there holding onto me. And it was total confusion. Then the worst part happened. There across the street was Ralph's car. It was on the back of a tow truck! And I wasn't thinking. I just sort of panicked, I guess. I tried to run after the tow truck, trying to make him stop.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. The police thought I was trying to get away. And before I had a chance to realize what hit me, I was in the back of the police car. And I lost Ralph's prescriptions. Oh my god! I feel like I'm starting to hyperventilate again.", "input": "", "output": "Just take a moment and remember to breath slowly. That's right. Good."}, {"instruction": "Whew! When the cop car started moving, I panicked. And it seemed like everything was slanted and in super slow motion. My hands were getting numb from the handcuffs, and my instincts made me kick the back of the seat. I think I broke it, too.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Alex."}, {"instruction": "So when I got to the police station, I had to answer all their questions, with and without Cecil being present. It took about six or seven hours to get it all straightened out. They questioned a lot of people who were around when Regina attacked me. They questioned me over and over again--typical. Cecil and I got to talk privately, and I told him everything just like I told you. I guess when a lawyer starts talking the police have to listen.", "input": "", "output": "Were you actually arrested?"}, {"instruction": "No, not at all. They just hauled my sorry ass in for questioning. I guess they must have talked to Regina, too. All I know is that she got arrested for assault and mayhem after Cecil was finished. He said she was stalking me. But now she's caught.", "input": "", "output": "That's a relief."}, {"instruction": "Now, how do I stop having nightmares about this? Every night since then, I've dreamt of her, of seeing her face and flames all around me, coming out of my skin. I try to make it stop, but it won't and...and, uh...", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Alex. Just relax and take a few deep slow breaths. There, that's right. You're doing better."}, {"instruction": "She really freaked me out, you know? Cecil took me to my mom's house, and I had to explain everything to Mark and my mom like seventeen times. Then I went home to Ralph's, and he could have worn a path in the carpet--he didn't know what happened to me. He was totally freaking. I had to explain about the car and...", "input": "", "output": "Why did it get towed? It couldn't have been parked for very long."}, {"instruction": "The parking spot was right on the corner and empty--and we're talking about the Castro. I just drove right into it, thinking I was totally lucky. Well, I parked in a construction zone and didn't even realize it. That's why they towed it. It cost almost two hundred dollars to get it back, and Ralph was not amused. Some good Samaritan picked up Ralph's prescriptions and turned them into the pharmacy, so we got those back. Right now, Ralph is having a meeting with his attorney about Regina's lawsuit. I think her getting arrested for stalking me puts things in a different light, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "I suppose it does."}, {"instruction": "Well, no matter. As long as she keeps spiraling out of control like this, she just slices her own throat deeper and deeper. Now they know she's the crazy one. Look at the time. I should probably get going. I have to get some stuff done, and lately, I haven't been able to even fathom how fast time is moving. There's hardly enough time in the day anymore to do everything I need to do. I don't know how I'm going to manage when school starts back up. What am I going to do about Ralph? Well, thanks for listening to me rant and rave, dude.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Alex. See you next week, Alex. And when you get yourself all worked up, don't forget to breathe. Slow yourself down, take some slow deep breaths. You won't hyperventilate if you remember to do it."}, {"instruction": "Oh. Okay! Thanks, dude. See you!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc! How you doing? Were you sick or something?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. I'm all right, I wasn't sick. I had to go back to New York on a family emergency.  I hope you got my messages."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I did.  Is everything cool?", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. Thank you for asking."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, sure...", "input": "", "output": "And how are you?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess. The weirdness never ends, though.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not everything is weird. Did I tell you that I saw Katherine? Now she had some funny stories to tell.", "input": "", "output": "How is she?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she's been back from Alaska for a few weeks now. We spent some time together just last week. She's buying a house.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. We went to see this house in Seacliff, it's real close to where that house almost went into the ocean this past winter. You should see the place! It's huge. The ceilings go up pretty high, and the windows are big and tall from floor to ceiling. And the views! You can see the Golden Gate Bridge from just about every room. It's so cool. Plus, we were having such a good time catching up and all. She even let me drive her Jaguar. Man! What a car! But...well, I kind of fucked up.", "input": "", "output": "Did you put a dent in it?"}, {"instruction": "No! No, nothing like that. I wasn't paying attention to the signs, and neither was Katherine. When we went to see the house, I parked in a tow away zone and...well...", "input": "", "output": "You got towed again?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I kind of got what I deserved. I really need to start paying attention to the signs, you know? First, she asked me where the car was, and I said it was right there, where I parked it, in front of the house. My heart totally stopped. Then I jangled the keys to make sure I still had them. For a minute, I even thought I might have left them in the ignition. But for like a split second, Katherine thought that maybe the car had gotten stolen, and she was saying something about the neighborhood until I pointed out the sign. That's when we realized the car had been towed, and I was all shitting in my pants. But she was so cool about it, she even laughed. That's why I like her so much, she handles things like no other adult I know. That girl has really got her shit together, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, it took hours to get it back, and it cost a lot of money, just like Ralph's car did. But by then, I was an old pro at getting towed cars out. Even though I was totally embarrassed, we both had a good laugh about it after. Katherine is like the coolest person in the entire world, dude.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad everything worked out. I can imagine your distress."}, {"instruction": "I'm telling you! If it had been my mom's car, she would've gone completely ballistic, not at all like Katherine. But Katherine told me all sorts of stories about her trip to Alaska. Did you know her father was a bush pilot? I think that's what they are called. There are seventeen air strips in Anchorage, and he used to fly the mail and supplies out to the people who lived out in the wilderness. He sounds like such a cool dude, you know? What a job. Now I want to go to Alaska! She told me about this train that rides out of Anchorage into the sticks. There are no stations, it just stops at the mile markers along the tracks. The conductor takes down a list of all the markers people want to stop at, and then they stop only at those. Or the people who are waiting to get on just flag it down, waving a white flag over their heads to make it stop when they see it coming. It's called The Alaskan Pickup Line.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds fascinating."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she made it sound better, though. She and Philip also went to this place called Talkeetna or something like that. There, they have what is called a Moose Dropping Festival.", "input": "", "output": "Huh?"}, {"instruction": "You heard me. Someone decided to celebrate moose poop. They shellac them and call them nuggets. Nice, huh? She told me they hold this \"Doo Drop\" where you buy a numbered nugget and then they string them up in small, hot, air balloons and drop them to the ground. The one that lands closest to a marker wins the prize. And I thought there was nothing to do up there!", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like Katherine had a good time."}, {"instruction": "She did. She showed me some of Philip's paintings he did, and wow! He did some incredible work. He even asked me if I wanted to assist him on a project that he's going to do--a project inspired by their trip. I haven't decided if I'm going to have the time for it yet, so I told him I'd let him know soon.", "input": "", "output": "That could be a nice opportunity."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I'm hoping that we can get another nurse for Ralph soon, that would take some of the load off my back. Maybe then, I'll have more time to do stuff like that.", "input": "", "output": "That would be good."}, {"instruction": "I know, that's why we're trying to get a few people over to the house to see if he likes one. So here's the weird part of what I wanted to tell you. Benny called.", "input": "", "output": "He did?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Out of the total fucking blue, he called me. So much for closing that book--remember that gypsy woman who told me that part of my life was over with?", "input": "", "output": "What did Benny say to you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when I realized it was him on the phone, I immediately snapped at him: \"Why are you calling me? What in hell do you want after all this time?\" Then I asked him why it took so long for him to call. He said he had been thinking about me for a long time and that he had called many times in the past few months. He said he always kept reaching the answering machine, and he wasn't sure if he should leave a message. So then, he told me he wanted to know how I was doing and what I was up to these days. It was just like that--he called as if nothing ever changed, like none of that shit ever came down.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It totally blew me away that he called me like that. I was so shocked, but secretly, I was happy to know he was thinking about me. I knew that if this was so heavy on my mind, it couldn't be too far from his thoughts either, you know? I told him how much hurt he caused, how damaged I...uh...hmm, how hard it was for me. I said that it would have been easier if he had just been honest with me from the beginning instead of lying. And the way he ended things...I told him how wrong it was--I deserved better treatment from him.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you had an opportunity to say those things to him. How did he respond?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he was very nice about it, which later, made me think that he was up to something, that he had ulterior motives. He said something like: \"The past is the past.\" And he acted like no time had passed between then and now. He teased me for spying on him that time when I slipped off the windowsill and tore my nose ring almost clean out of my nose. But I remember I kicked his ass pretty good. There was a lot of blood. I reminded him of that, and then he went silent for a minute. Anyway, we talked for a long time. Normally, I start to drop off into a coma when I'm on the phone too long. Usually I'd say, \"Bored now, bye!\" and just hang up to end the call, but with him I didn't. With him, I wanted to keep talking, I didn't want it to end. I know I was too easy.", "input": "", "output": "No, I don't think so. It sounds like it did you some good to express some of your feelings and anger to Benny. Perhaps this is the beginning of the end. Maybe you got some closure from that conversation."}, {"instruction": "Maybe. I don't know. He asked me to come to see him sometime, and I am actually thinking about it. He's over in Copperopolis, so it's only about a three-hour drive from here. But...I don't know. I don't want him to think that just because he called, everything is cool now, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "But then Luke happened. He was there when I got the call from Benny, and he wasn't too happy that I talked with Benny as long as I did. And then the doorbell rang. You'll never guess who it was.", "input": "", "output": "It wasn't Benny."}, {"instruction": "No, that would have given me a heart attack. But you're close. Ralph had called Waiters on Wheels, and do remember that guy I told you about? The one at Dore Alley? The one I had that vivid nasty dream about? He was the delivery guy for Waiters on Wheels. When I opened the door, I became the proverbial deer in the headlights. He just looked me up and down with a big grin on his face, and he said something like, \"So, we meet again. And now I know where you live.\" Well, after the phone call with Benny, Luke was already getting pissed, and then that happened. Luke was all, \"Who the fuck was that? What did he mean by 'so we meet again?' \" And what was I supposed to say?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Ralph...well, he's been on those Vicodin pills, and so he was all loose and free, totally chowing down by then. He went, \"Oh, that's the guy who looks like Benny. He really does, Alex, doesn't he?\" Luke had never seen Benny before, not even a picture, so he had no idea. And I was gritting my teeth going, \"Okay, Ralph, you can shut-up now.\" But by then, Luke was completely pissed and just stormed out in a fury. Plus, the next morning, Luke's flight left for New York early, so I didn't get a chance to set it right with him. He didn't call me when he got there, like he normally does. So now I'm fucked. Luke totally bagged on me, and I blew it. But...I don't really know what I did wrong, other than talk to Benny for so long. If Luke would actually spend some time here with me instead of using San Francisco just as a stopping point, maybe he'd know what's going on. I don't know, I'm kind of pissed now.", "input": "", "output": "This must be frustrating for you."}, {"instruction": "It is! It really is frustrating. I mean...well, I don't know. Now that guy is on my mind again. He knows where I live, and if you could've seen the look he gave me...he practically undressed me with his eyes. I felt so...so...naked. He made me feel the blood pumping up into my face, you know? And Luke saw it all, too! What luck. What dumb fucking luck!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure that once you get a chance to sit down and talk with Luke, you will work this out..."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, man. This time it felt...it was sort of...it had this feeling like it was over, like this was final. I wish he would call me or something.", "input": "", "output": "He will.  After all you've been through together, I don't think your relationship will end over petty jealousies."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, we'll see. I really should be going, I promised Tony that I would go with him to one of those druggie meetings. He needs the moral support. He's still spinning over that girl, what's her name? I don't want to be late, he'll get all nervous.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Alex. I'll see you next week, same time."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Talk to you later, dude!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "I'm all fucked up, that's what's wrong! And I don't know what I was thinking by going there...what a fool I am! Now I understand why I come here to see you--I am crazy. I am totally certifiable!", "input": "", "output": "What happened? Where did you go?"}, {"instruction": "Doc, I saw him. Him! After all this time...", "input": "", "output": "Benny?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Benny! I saw him. I don't know what I was thinking, you know? Something inside me couldn't resist when he asked me to come see him. I am such a fool! I drove out to see him; Cami came along for the ride, and it was a good thing, too! I practically went to pieces. Right now, it doesn't feel like any of it really happened, but it did. I'm like...I'm all, I don't know. It was so weird. I said a lot--too much. I revealed everything to him, and I probably shouldn't have.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "When our eyes met, it was...well, it was like we were both frozen and speechless, like a thousand years could have passed without either of us realizing any time had gone by. It seemed like an eternity of silence passed until he finally asked me how I was. I couldn't even answer him at first, I just wanted to look at him...to see him again like that. It was so strange--him being locked up like that. I never in a million years thought I would ever see him again, look into his eyes, and hear his voice. He tried to touch me through the divider thing, but the guard put a stop to that instantly. Benny told me he knew how badly he left things between us and that he wanted to make amends. I couldn't believe my ears at first. I wanted so much to believe him. And then I wondered how sincere he was. What was he up to? I couldn't trust him.", "input": "", "output": "And for a good reason."}, {"instruction": "You really don't like him, do you?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, Benny..."}, {"instruction": "I...uh, I know, but...", "input": "", "output": "But what?"}, {"instruction": "But it felt like the old times there for a while. He was so charming and nice to me. He seemed interested in the things I had to say, and, naturally, it felt good when he did that. But then I...well, I...uh, I sort of unleashed a whole torrent of emotions on him. I told him I loved him. I told him I hated him. I told him that I didn't want to go through my life hating him for what he did to me. I don't want to be someone who isn't able to trust anyone ever again.", "input": "", "output": "How did he respond?"}, {"instruction": "He stayed cool and good-natured, I guess, for the most part. But then, I told him how he hurt me, dumping me the way he did. And he said, \"There's that word again.\" And I was all, \"What else can it be called? You dumped me!\" He could have talked to me, you know? He could have clued me in to what was going on with him, but he didn't. He just yanked the rug right out from under me and left me scrambling to get my balance again on my own. Leaving things so unsettled made me crazy. Shit! I'm still crazy--I told him that I still loved him and that I wished we were back together, can you believe that? I can puke my guts out, knowing that I said that to him. I did puke my guts out later.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you're only human..."}, {"instruction": "By then, a full range of emotions had overcome me. I didn't expect to react so ballistic. And I was doing pretty well there for a while, these past few months...but I pointed out to him that people, especially people like me, are not disposable. I believed that nothing could ever come between us. I told him that the way he treated me in the end made me think that nothing between us ever really mattered to him. He said that wasn't true. I told him I needed him to be loyal, to not betray me. Then I mentioned Roly, and he tensed up--it was very noticeable. He said that he really did always care about us, about me. He said that he was sorry. That's when I just...well, that's when I...uh...uh, I...", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, Alex. Here's a tissue."}, {"instruction": "Fuck! I saw his eyes well with tears, and he was shaking. Soon after, our time was up. As I walked away from him, I realized that I may never see him again, and I got even more emotional. Plus, I didn't get a chance to say everything I needed to say to him. And he hardly said enough to me. He was still so vague and so shielded from me. Lucky for us both, that chain link divider kept us apart. There were points when I felt like spitting in his face and swearing at him. And sometimes, I felt like wrapping my arms around him tightly and never letting go. I'm so embarrassed...", "input": "", "output": "When you saw Benny, you dropped your guard. He was familiar to you. He seemed comfortable. But you were still able to say things to Benny that you needed him to hear. You told Benny that you weren't disposable. That was very important. It was important for you to say that. You were able to stand up for yourself in front of Benny. That was a big step. I'm proud of you for being able to do that, Alex."}, {"instruction": "For a split second, I saw a tear in his eye. But you know, now I wonder how real that was. Did I imagine all of it? Or...I don't know. I saw by the way Benny acted that he wasn't any different now than he was then. It was that vague thing that he does...some things never change, you know? And sometimes, saying you're sorry just isn't enough. Did you ever hear the term \"too little, too late?\" Well, that's kind of how I feel about this, you know? But on the drive home, I was so twisted up about this, crying and shit, I had to pull over and let Cami drive. That was when I hurled my guts out on the side of the road. I was shaking all over, like I was ice-cold. I never shook like that before. Cami kept talking to me and tried to calm me down, but I wasn't able to stop shaking. Even my teeth were chattering. That's when she gave me something to calm me down.", "input": "", "output": "What did she give you?"}, {"instruction": "A pill, I don't know what it was called. Here, I still have the bottle. It says Nembutal. I even took some before I went to bed that night, and that stuff works so much better than Melatonin, especially when you smoke a little...", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you know what I'm going to say about this..."}, {"instruction": "Then don't say it, man.", "input": "", "output": "Using marijuana as a sleeping aid is bad. Taking someone else's prescription drugs is very bad, Alex. You didn't even know what it was. The consequences could have been...I would like you to give me what you have left there."}, {"instruction": "Are you kidding? Really? What's wrong with this stuff? It helps me sleep, and I'm able to get calm and relaxed after I take one.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, Nembutal is highly addictive. Please, let me see that bottle."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. It's only a little capsule.", "input": "", "output": "If you are having trouble sleeping, Melatonin is the best thing for you to take. And if worse comes to worst, I will prescribe for you something less addictive than Nembutal and with fewer side effects."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. Well, I can't give them to you, I have to give them back to Cami. They're her mom's or something. I'm not an addict, like those freaks in Tony's Rational Recovery meetings.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Alex, if you won't give me the pills, then promise me that you won't take any more. Please, just stick to Melatonin. You seem to be handling the anxiety pretty well now; you don't need to take these. Promise?"}, {"instruction": "Okay! Enough already, all right? I'll give them back to Cami, and I won't take anymore. Jeez! Next thing I know, you'll be insisting that I go to those meetings with Tony or something. Those drug addicts--you should see them--are all pale and starved. This one guy had pimple scars or something all over his face--gross! Plus, they're supposed to be clean and sober, and I could tell some of them weren't. And they were all drinking coffee--they gave up speed and switched to caffeine. Such hypocrites! I won't let myself end up like that. Speaking of hypocrites, did I tell you I almost ended up in jail?", "input": "", "output": "You sound like you're bragging about it."}, {"instruction": "Those damn hypocrite sheriffs gave me and Mr. Wow tickets.", "input": "", "output": "Mr. Wow?"}, {"instruction": "You know--he's that guy who looks like Benny. The one who works at Waiters on Wheels? That's why I call him Mr. Wow. His name is Ted, and he called and invited me to go to the beach with him. This time he left his codpiece at home, and wow! I was like, \"Oh my!\" That's the other reason I named him Mr. Wow.", "input": "", "output": "I take it you went to a nude beach?"}, {"instruction": "You got it! It was hard, uh...I mean I had a hard time...uh, no. I mean I had a little trouble hiding my, uh...my interest in him. Yeah, that's it, my interest.", "input": "", "output": "So what happened?"}, {"instruction": "What didn't happen?", "input": "", "output": "Why did you have trouble with the sheriff?"}, {"instruction": "Well, this was at that beach that's just south of Devil's Slide on Highway 1. When we went up the trail to go back to the car, the sheriff was waiting for us. He told us that hiking or climbing is prohibited there. I told him that we just walked up a trail, but he wrote out the tickets anyway. But what burned my ass was the fact that the only reason the sheriff was there was because they were practicing  rappelling down the rocks. And he told us that hiking or climbing was prohibited--hypocrite.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you didn't tell him that to his face."}, {"instruction": "No, not to his face. But when he handed me the pen to sign the ticket, I told him that I didn't want to sign it. That's when he told me that he would take me to jail. So I snatched that pen up and signed without delay--I may be lonely, but I'm not that lonely! So now, I have to go to court next month to fight it. Ted said he got a ticket before for the same thing, but they dismissed the case when he went to court. So I'm hoping they'll do the same with me. It was a good thing they didn't search us.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Two reasons. One, I had my prized knife on me. And two, I had a joint.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you got lucky, Alex. I'm afraid to ask but..."}, {"instruction": "Then don't ask, dude. But I do think I got lucky--I've been weak in the knees ever since.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Alex, I'd like to ask you about the..."}, {"instruction": "You want to know why I am smoking again, don't you? Well, it's because it's there. Because it feels good. I don't know. Since Benny, I've been all tense, and I feel kind of shaky, you know? When I take a few hits from a joint, I feel better for a while. And I keep having these weird dreams. But when I smoke, I notice that I don't dream as much. So that makes it better, too.", "input": "", "output": "That could also have been the result of Nembutal. Alex, I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that your drug use concerns me. Please don't abuse drugs, they really are only a temporary fix and not a good solution. They only lead to more problems."}, {"instruction": "Now, don't get all preachy with me, I'm not addicted. Shit! I haven't been taking enough of it to become addicted! Don't worry, dude.", "input": "", "output": "I do worry, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Don't. I'll be fine. That thing with Benny was just temporary insanity. And what better way is there to cure that than with something else that's temporary? They'll cancel each other out. Get it?", "input": "", "output": "Somehow I don't get the logic in that."}, {"instruction": "You don't have to, I do.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it looks like we're out of time for today, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Okay, dude. I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex. And please, be careful, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Dude! Don't worry, I'll be all right.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Alex. Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. Well, it's official--Luke and I are broken up.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it all started with the fire.", "input": "", "output": "Fire?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, we had a fire at Ralph's. Oh, it was small, really--just one little wall in the kitchen is burned, along with the stove top, hood, and all the pots and pans hanging there. There was some water damage to the floor and the basement below. And smoke...the smell of smoke was everywhere. I still smell it sometimes. But we were really lucky. And it was an excellent and not so excellent timing on Luke's part.", "input": "", "output": "Why's that?"}, {"instruction": "I guess he got back from the East Coast and decided to just drop by. He hasn't called in three weeks or so, and then he just slipped into town unannounced and dropped by. No phone call, no letter, nothing from him in all that time, and then he just dropped over. But if he hadn't, Ralph would probably be in the hospital right now or maybe even dead, and we wouldn't have broken up the way we did.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was Ralph and his stupid Vicodin pills. He told me that he put something on the stove and then took one of those pills. Next thing you know--charcoal city! He passed out! And you were worried about me taking drugs; Ralph is totally addicted to those things.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He passed out while the kitchen was catching on fire. Luke came to the door and smelled smoke, and no one answered the door of course. So Luke went around to the garden and saw smoke pouring out of the kitchen window. I guess he went up the steps and saw Ralph passed out in his chair. So he got inside and pulled Ralph out. By then, the smoke alarm had gone off--it's one of those kind that calls emergency when it goes off. Well, when we got back to the house, the fire department was there, and the fire was out. I was thinking that Ralph...well, I mean...I didn't know right away that there was a fire, and I pictured Ralph....well, you know. My heart totally stopped when we came around the corner to see all that.", "input": "", "output": "I completely understand."}, {"instruction": "Well, anyway...Ralph was in the ambulance, and he was breathing oxygen through one of those mask things. And then I saw Luke, and he was fuming! His face was...I don't know, he looked like he wanted to murder me.", "input": "", "output": "Why was he so upset? Was it because of Ralph?"}, {"instruction": "No, no. It wasn't. It was because of Ted.", "input": "", "output": "Ted?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Ted! You don't remember him? The guy who...", "input": "", "output": "The guy who looks like Benny."}, {"instruction": "Thank you! I had gone out with him again. Well actually, I've gone out with him four times. No, five times since I saw you last. I really like him, and he's here and not off somewhere in New York or Milan or something. But he and I were just coming back from the beach again when we came upon this pandemonium.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "You do? See what? You're getting that funny look again.", "input": "", "output": "Well, you mentioned before that you didn't like Luke traveling so much."}, {"instruction": "I didn't like it! I mean, how am I supposed to have a relationship with someone who is never here? I really thought we had something good going there for a while, but then...well, he got all wound up in this modeling career and shit. It's because Luke's so damned good looking. I don't know. Things have been kind of weird between us since that time with Cami, you know? He didn't get over it or something. Or maybe it was me who didn't get over it, I don't know. But things were different between us. It was like I was walking on eggshells around him and he was ready to explode at any moment. And he did explode. A few times. But where were we?", "input": "", "output": "Well, you were telling me..."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah! Yeah, I remember. So Luke was standing there glaring at me. If he could have done it, I would have been reduced to ashes right there. I was all...well, I just stood there. What was I supposed to do? Ted was standing there wondering what the hell was going on, and Luke did his little cut and run act on me.", "input": "", "output": "Cut and run?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you know. He stomped off like a little spoiled child. Well, I ran and caught up with him. I grabbed his arm, and he jerked away from me and gave me this look--he looked at me with daggers in his eyes. I told him just what I told you: I wouldn't be going out with Ted if Luke was here instead of somewhere else always working. Money isn't everything. And all Luke could say was that I cheated on him and that it was over. He said that he was going to move to New York or something. And I was like, \"Just as I suspected!\" So I told him to just go. I told him that we wouldn't be going on like this if he wasn't so twisted about everything. It's like, \"Oh my god, he's doing S&M! Heavens to megatroid, a lesbiterian!\" Get over yourself, dude! I mean...whatever.", "input": "", "output": "But, Alex, you can see Luke's point, can't you?"}, {"instruction": "What is this? You're suppose to be on my side!", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I'm supposed to help you see things from different perspectives. I do see your side of it, too, Alex. I understand how difficult it is to always wait for someone's return."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, waiting. Well, I'm through waiting!", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Did you ever find out why Luke came to the house in the first place?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when he was yelling at me, he said he came by to talk to me and find out where we stood. But when he saw me and Ted together, he knew right away where we stood. Well, that was what he said, not me. I told him so, too. I told him that if he had paid more attention to me and not to his career...", "input": "", "output": "That is what I was getting at, Alex, when I asked you to see Luke's point of view. He has his career and it puts a lot of demands on him and his time. From what you've told me, he's required to travel, and I'm sure there are other demands as well."}, {"instruction": "There are, you don't have to remind me. Luke was weird about food, about eating in particular. Oh, I don't know. We don't need to go there. And I don't really feel all that bad about it. Tony always said that Luke was my rebound relationship, and maybe that's why I don't feel bad about the break up. I don't know. Well, maybe the fact that Benny was still on my mind...and the fire...all of it has kind of blown me away. Somehow my mind managed to merge that thing with Regina with the fire, producing this strange and bizarre dream I had.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure if I can explain it and make sense, too. In the beginning of the dream somewhere, I think I saw Regina, acting crazy like she always does. And then I saw Benny, only I was running away from him. Then I was in this room, and the walls were dripping in flames. The curtains were slowly getting eaten up by the flames, and the ceiling was engulfed. The fire was roaring across the ceiling, and I could hear the smoke alarm going off, louder and louder. Before I knew it, I couldn't breathe, and I fell to my knees--I didn't want to get up and run. Then, all of a sudden, the door was kicked down, and a silhouette of a fireman came toward me. I yelled at him to stop and get out, to save himself. And as he scooped me up in his arms, his helmet flipped up, and I was looking into a mirror. He said, \"I am. I am trying to save myself.\" And then I woke up, covered in sweat. My pulse was pounding strong. I've been thinking about the dream ever since. It really bugged me. It was me in the fireman's uniform. I was trying to save myself. And now I'm trying to figure out what I'm trying to save myself from. Tony said that clearly I'm trying to save myself from myself. And I told him I wanted to slap him. And he just said, \"Please do!\" Well, I don't want to go there, either, thank you very much! But it really made me think.", "input": "", "output": "That was a powerful dream."}, {"instruction": "You just don't know, dude. Uh...oh, I'm sorry. I can't seem to control this yawning thing I've been doing. It's just that I'm really sleepy lately. I guess it's because of school; I'm still trying to get adjusted to that pace again.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't realize you were back in school already."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's been a few weeks now. The only class I like is my art class. The instructor is teaching us how to paint in watercolor, and it's a real challenge for me. If I do anything worthwhile, I'll bring it in so you can see it.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks, I'd like that."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, maybe I should be going. I have to pick up some more drugs for Ralph today. Oh, we got a nurse for him, a girl nurse named Rita. I call her Dita because she's such a dominatrix. My guess is that she goes home and whips the shit out of some drooling guy. But she is a no nonsense kind of woman and gets her job done, and Ralph likes her. She thinks...I don't know what she thinks, but you can tell she is thinking something...I think it's something about me, something about Ralph, and then something about the both of us. I don't know. She's a trip. One of these days, I'm going to follow her and I'll find out what she does when she's not working.", "input": "", "output": "Alex!"}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "You're not really going to do that, are you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, maybe. She intrigues me.", "input": "", "output": "So just ask her questions, get her to open up to you. I know you know how to turn on that charm."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. So, Doctor, are you ever going to tell me whether it's a boyfriend or a girlfriend?", "input": "", "output": "Alex!"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's been driving me wild ever since I thought about it. Maybe I ought to follow you sometimes, hmm?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I think this is not productive..."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry. I'm just playing with you! I was just wondering who helped you when your father was sick recently.", "input": "", "output": "Helped me?"}, {"instruction": "Yes? I'm waiting!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, this is definitely not the reason we are here. Let's get back on track, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Damn! You aren't going to give it up, are you? Oh well, one of these days, I'm going to figure you out. This curiosity...", "input": "", "output": "Alex, just drop it."}, {"instruction": "You have that look. Well, dude, I am leaving now, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, certainly. We're out of time."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes, certainly!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, right...", "input": "", "output": "Alex? What is it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, in case you can't tell by just looking at me, I haven't been getting much sleep lately. And I'm not really in the mood for this...uh, this shit, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Is there a reason why you are not sleeping?"}, {"instruction": "Is there a reason? Ha! Sometimes, I think I'd be better off dead or something! A reason! Well, I'll give you twenty guesses.", "input": "", "output": "I'd much rather not play a guessing game with you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Oh, you'll figure it out if you just think for a second. I'll bet you'll get it on the first guess. Well? Okay, you have that stupid look you get! It's Benny again. Again, again, and again! It always goes back to him. Jeez! The fucking bastard!", "input": "", "output": "He's still on your mind..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, no shit, Sherlock! He's always on my mind. That fucking asshole!", "input": "", "output": "Has something happened to make you so angry?"}, {"instruction": "No kidding! Sharp as a meatball, that's what I always say about you! Okay. Well, Cecil called the other day. He asked me to come to his office alone.", "input": "", "output": "What did he tell you?"}, {"instruction": "Since he knows the lawyer that tried to help Benny, he has some inside information. Damn! I still can't fucking believe it! It's like...it's like I've been dreaming, and I can't wake up from this nightmare. You can't know a dream until you know a nightmare, especially this nightmare.", "input": "", "output": "Well?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he's going to get out! That's what I've been trying to tell you!", "input": "", "output": "He's getting out?"}, {"instruction": "You heard me right. Out! O. U. T. Out! They're letting him loose. It's something about an appeal or something like that. They're letting him out of fucking jail. And he's going to come back! He's going to come back to get me. He's going to get revenge. Or maybe he wants me back. I don't know! I...well, I just...well, I can't believe...I couldn't believe my ears! I'm all...uh, I...", "input": "", "output": "Alex, please. Take a few slow, deep breaths. Good. That's it."}, {"instruction": "I was beginning to hyperventilate. Again!", "input": "", "output": "You were starting to turn blue."}, {"instruction": "Well, maybe I can hyperventilate into a coma or something. Anything would be better than this. He knew, Doc! He knew all along that he was getting, and that's why he called me. He knew when he called. And he knew when he saw me, when I went to see him in prison, and he didn't say a word! Remember? I told you he had ulterior motives, that he was up to something. I told you! Not even a hint, you know? And he seemed so real, too. But he wasn't, was he? He was playing with me like that...everything was going so well for me, too...well, everything except for what happened between Luke and me. But now, he just...he...uh, he pops up right out of the blue. And he tried to act like we were...like we are best friends, like nothing ever came down between us.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He was so sincere, so charming. All this has brought it back up like it was yesterday, like we broke up just yesterday. He brought it all back to me like a bad relapse.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "And some things never change...nothing ever changes, you know? He's still the same manipulative mother fucker that he always was. And me...well, I'm all tangled up in it. I have been sitting in my room or in the studio, by myself, crying my eyes out. And now I'm all cried out. It was nonstop sometimes, for hours, all night. I went over to his house, where he used to live, and I remembered the rage that Roly and I went into that night, the night we trashed his car. I don't even know...no, he couldn't have seen what we did, he was in jail by then, but Dora probably told him. Fuck! I don't know...I just don't know what I'm going to do, you know?", "input": "", "output": "The first thing you need to do is get a restraining order. Benny should not be allowed to come into any contact with you. You can tell Cecil to help you. I'm sure it will be fairly easy, given that you were a witness at his trial. Then you need to..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah...everyone says the same damn thing. He's no good, and I know that already. He's no damn good. Cami never knew him, but she said that I am a completely different person when he's in my consciousness. And I am, I can see that much. And I don't like who I am when he's in the picture. I don't like how he effects me at all. He effects me like alcohol effects an alcoholic! When I'm around him or talking to him on the phone, something takes hold of me. I become...I'm a different person. I'm a wimp, and I feel so creepy. He has this weird hold over me.", "input": "", "output": "You can break that hold, Alex. Look where you were then and compare it to where you are in your life now. You've come a long way and made many positive changes since then. Alex, you don't have to let him..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but...", "input": "", "output": "But what?"}, {"instruction": "Part of me wants him back. Isn't that sick? I always did want him back, secretly. Well, I think you knew that.", "input": "", "output": "I did. But is that the right thing for you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I don't think so. He is so wrong! So wrong! And another part of me wants revenge, revenge for me and revenge for Roly's death. Roly wouldn't have thrown himself in front of that BART train if it hadn't been for what Benny did to us.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, revenge will only hurt you..."}, {"instruction": "Well, I...uh, I can...but he deserves to be in jail! He deserves to suffer! He deserves to burn in hell. I want to...I want...well, I wish I could rip him limb from limb, bit to bit with my bare hands. I wish I could make him suffer the same way he made me and Roly suffer. Part of me wants to accept him back into my life just so I could yank the rug out from under him, like he did to me. And then we'll see just how he will feel. I want to spit in his face and laugh at him. He is such a loser--a cheating, lying, thieving loser! And I want to kill him...", "input": "", "output": "Alex, any physical action you take against Benny will only hurt you. It would most certainly backfire on you, I'm certain of that."}, {"instruction": "Don't ruin it, dude. Don't spoil my fantasy, okay?", "input": "", "output": "So long as it's only a fantasy."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well...", "input": "", "output": "Did Cecil say when Benny would be released?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? Uh, yes, he did. I think. He said it may be any day now. How could they do this? How could they let this happen? They did this thing--an \"appeal\" he called it...and now they are going to just let him go. Just like that! One day, he's a convicted child molester, and the next day, he walks. How fair is that? What about me? What about Roly? And the tapes! They had enough evidence on the tapes to keep him locked up for years. Cecil tried to explain it to me, but none of it makes any sense. Everything he said just became a blur, white noise. It just blended into everything else. He could have been rambling on for all I knew. He could have been insulting me something fierce, and I wouldn't have known the difference. It's just that I...nothing anyone can say will ever make me understand all of this.", "input": "", "output": "I don't understand it, either. But sometimes the law works in very strange and unpredictable ways, Alex. Lawyers figure out every angle--that's their job."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but is it their job to let criminals go free? It's not fair!", "input": "", "output": "I know it isn't fair. But sometimes things just work out that way. Do you know if there's going to be a new trial?"}, {"instruction": "A new trial--you're shitting me!", "input": "", "output": "Well, I don't know about that.  But I do know that you have got to get yourself together and get prepared, Alex. You need to be ready when Benny tries to come and see you."}, {"instruction": "Well, he better be prepared to get his ass kicked good, too! But he doesn't know that I live with Ralph. Oh, wait! Yes, he does. He does know, because that's where he's been calling me. Fuck! He knows where I live! It's just what I need right now, too. And Ralph is so sick. Shit! The only good thing to have happened lately is the fact that crazy bitch Regina isn't going to be able to sue Ralph. After she got arrested for stalking me, the lawyer said she doesn't have a leg to stand on. They dismissed the whole thing. It was too ridiculous. Ralph's lawyer said she was lucky Ralph didn't get her for trespassing. I guess she can sue the guy who hit her with his car or something. She had that accident...I hear she's been milking that good. She claims to not remember anything just before the accident--she has amnesia or something. But I know she's just faking it, the evil little thing she is!", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that her lawsuit against Ralph has been dismissed."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he has enough on his mind right now. This week, they started him on radiation. So now he is on chemotherapy and radiation, and it isn't pretty, I'm telling you. He isn't handling it well at all. It's a good thing we have Dita around to help him out while I'm not there. And with all that's been on my mind, I'm not very good for him right now anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Don't be so hard on yourself..."}, {"instruction": "Why can't Benny just drop off the face of the Earth or something? Why can't a Mack truck just flatten him? That would make my life so much easier. I just wish he would go away...go away forever. As long as he's breathing, I'm not going to get any rest at all. Someone has got to stop him, you know?", "input": "", "output": "But not you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Why not?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I'm concerned about all this talk of revenge. You really need to understand that you can't take justice into your own hands..."}, {"instruction": "You know, you just gave me an idea...well, I've got to go now, Doctor. Bye!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, wait!"}, {"instruction": "I'm out of here, dude. See you!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, hold on a minute."}, {"instruction": "Sorry, dude, I've got to go! Later!", "input": "", "output": "Alex. Alex!"}, {"instruction": "Hey, dude. Sorry, I was just...", "input": "", "output": "Who was that?"}, {"instruction": "That was Ted. I was just saying goodbye to him. He dropped me off today, and now he's off to work.", "input": "", "output": "I see. You look..."}, {"instruction": "Rested?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. You do look much better this week. You had me really worried last week when you ran out of the session..."}, {"instruction": "Dude! I told you not to worry about me. I'm a cat, I always land on my feet, one way or another.", "input": "", "output": "So what's happened since last week?"}, {"instruction": "Do you mean Benny?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's been a weird week. He's definitely out or back or whatever! We keep missing each other. And Ted and Cami sort of kidnapped me last weekend--I guess they kind of saved me from myself and from Benny. But wait. You have to remind me to tell you about Katherine, okay? Oh and...you should have seen it! Do you know those guys out there tearing up the street in front of your building?", "input": "", "output": "Not personally."}, {"instruction": "Well, one of them is real burly and hunky. And he was all...well, you probably don't want to hear this, but...too bad, you're going to hear it anyway! He was all bent over, practically grabbing his ankles, and I couldn't stop looking at him. So that's the other reason why I was a little late getting here today--I was transfixed by that incredible ass he has. Ted asked me what I was looking at, and I told him I was looking at that dude. Doesn't he know that he shouldn't be bending over like that in San Francisco? He could end up with quite a surprise doing that! I know I can't be the only one who notices stuff like that around this town. Talk about temptation knocking!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay, I'll knock it off. But I've been in this weird mood this week, ever since Cami and Ted took me up to Calistoga this past weekend. We went to the mud baths and got the works. Have you been there?", "input": "", "output": "No, I haven't."}, {"instruction": "Well, you don't know what you're missing, dude. It's so cool! First, you shower down. Showers. The weather forecast said we were going to have scat showers, at least that was what the little TV graphic showed: scat showers! Somebody made a mistake at the TV station, but I was thinking gross. I thought we're going need some heavy duty umbrellas for that! Totally gross! And somehow, my warped little mind pictured it and everything...scat showers! What a mess that would have been! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!", "input": "", "output": "Alex?"}, {"instruction": "Well? We didn't end up having any kind of showers at all. It was sunny and warm. Anyway, first, we had to shower down. I guess they make you do that so you can get used to the heat of the mud or something. Then, you climb into this big tub filled with volcanic ash, and peat moss, and some other muddy, thick stuff. It was hot! But it felt so good and kind of weird, too. It was all gooey and lumpy and stuff, surrounding my naked body. After the mud, you climb out and wipe away as much mud as you can. And let me tell you, it gets into everything, every crack and crevice. So you can't just wipe it all away, it totally sticks to you. So we got into the showers again to wash away the rest of the mud. And then we got into this boiling-hot mineral water bath. And man! I sat in it for a while. And when I got out, I nearly passed out. The guys who worked there were all, \"Dude, let me get you some water. Dude, sit down here. Are you okay?\" So I sat it out for a few minutes until the stars stopped popping off all around my head. And then after that, we went into the steam room and sweat some more. Well, I've been totally relaxed and weird ever since. We went to a couple of wineries: Clos Pegasse and Sterling, where you ride on a gondola up to the winery. That was way cool. Katherine sort of wrote out our itinerary for us. Dude, she is so cool. She knows about everything. I totally worship the water she walks on!", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you had a nice time, Alex."}, {"instruction": "We did. Totally nice. We ate like pigs, too! We had dinner at a restaurant called Alex's Restaurant, can you believe it? It made me forget all about the jerk, you know? The one thing I noticed when we left The City was all this open space up there and all the trees. It made me uncomfortable--wouldn't someone have paved over all that by now? There should be super shopping malls and acres of parking lots all up there. And those trees, those damned trees were sucking up all my valuable oxygen!", "input": "", "output": "You are in a funny mood today, Alex. I haven't seen you like this in a long time."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I can't help myself. Maybe it's because of the full moon we had the other day. Or maybe it's because of Ted. Or maybe it's because of Cami. I noticed that since Benny left my life, all these positive people have came into my life. First, it was Katherine, then Cami, and now Ted. And of course I can't leave out Ralph. But Ralph was there before Benny left, and he turned out to be so not like I originally thought he was.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I'm glad you've noticed the positive influences in your life."}, {"instruction": "Well, with the Asshole back in town...I think he did me a big favor, really.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I realized he hasn't changed. It's like I told you last week, he knew he was getting out when he manipulated me into coming to see him in prison. And he didn't say a word about it, not even the slightest hint. And that is so like Benny to do something like that. He was feeling me out, probably to see if I was the same naive fool I was before. I don't know. But the thing is, he is still the same jerk he was before. That's for sure. But when I left here last week, I had a plan...", "input": "", "output": "That's what I was worried about. I though you might have been up to something. What was your plan?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I was...I don't know, dude. I still may do it, just for fun, just to fuck with his head a little.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think I'm going to like this..."}, {"instruction": "And I don't think Benny will like it either, once he realizes he's been had. I'm not the same stupid fool I was then.", "input": "", "output": "And how are you going to prove that to him?"}, {"instruction": "Hell, yes. I'm going to prove it to him! Hell, yes! When he and I finally come face to face, he's going to be in for a big surprise. I'm not going to fold into that blubbering idiot again. I'm going to stand up to him and tell him like it is. You don't fuck with someone the way he did with me and just walk away without getting something in return, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, this is what I was trying to tell you before..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah...", "input": "", "output": "I'm serious, Alex. If you act out a revenge fantasy, it's only going to make things worse and it might get you in a whole lot of trouble."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, if I don't do something, I think this will continue to be a whole lot of trouble. Benny's going to keep coming back to haunt me until I show him that I'm the one in charge now and that he can't manipulate me anymore. He needs to crawl back under the rock he came from and leave me the fuck alone.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you think that Benny won't leave you alone?"}, {"instruction": "Dude, you haven't been paying attention again! He called me, remember? And not only that, he came over to Ralph's house, and stupid Ralph let him in. Thankfully, I wasn't there or hell would have opened up, I'm telling you. Yeah. So Ralph let him in, and he waited there, talking to Ralph for like an hour or something. He told Ralph to have me call him. I was all: \"Right! Okay, Ralph, take another pill!\" But I did go over to his house last week, after I left here. I wanted to see if he had come back yet, but it didn't look like he did by then. If he had been there, I was going to spit in his face. That's all.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I really must encourage you to rethink this. Your plan to have a confrontation with Benny will only antagonize the situation. I think it's best if you simply ignore him and get that restraining order we talked about last time.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, right! Hello? Ignore him? Well, he isn't going to go away that easy. I just wish that someone would off him or something. The minute he stops breathing is the minute I'm going to be able to rest. But until then...I don't know. Do we have to keep talking about this?", "input": "", "output": "I really want you to think about all the consequences..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...well, whatever! Anyway, I wanted to tell you about Katherine. Remember I told you that I went with her to look at that huge house over in Sea Cliff?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I remember."}, {"instruction": "She's buying it. I guess she's now waiting for escrow to close or something. I think that's what she called it. Escrow. I told her I would help her move if she wanted me to. I can get a bunch of guys together, and they would help with the move. She said she'd like that. But she's redoing the kitchen first or something. She expects to start moving soon. She is like a goddess, you know? Like I said before, I totally worship the water she walks on. I even said that to her, and she became sort of...I don't know. I could tell that she liked hearing it, but she was too proud to let me get away with saying it. She and Philip are both totally cool people. Their mom must be something else, too, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Katherine certainly seems fond of you, too, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she does, doesn't she? I'm so lucky--all these cool and totally positive people...even you too, dude. You're totally cool, too, even though you won't tell me whether it's a boyfriend or a girlfriend.", "input": "", "output": "Please, not that again..."}, {"instruction": "Well? One of these days I'm going to pry it out of you. You know you and Katherine would make a...no, never mind. That would be too weird, even for me!", "input": "", "output": "That would be unethical."}, {"instruction": "Whatever. But I can tell by that look on your face that you're thinking about it! Dude! You are so funny. I love that look you get when you get flustered! Ha! Ha! Ha!", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Alex, we're out of time for today."}, {"instruction": "How totally convenient for you, uh?", "input": "", "output": "Same time next week then?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, dude. You are so completely a trip, you know that?", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex!"}, {"instruction": "Hey, dude!", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. Have a seat. How are you this week?"}, {"instruction": "It's been a funny time for me, you know? And I don't mean funny as in \"ha ha,\" either.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, with the return of Benny, and all that's been happening with Ralph and with Ted, and...I feel like I'm in one of those stupid soap operas. But believe it or not, I've been in a pretty good mood, considering. Oh, the other day, I played a trick on everyone at the Alliance. It was pretty funny!", "input": "", "output": "What did you do, Alex?"}, {"instruction": "I'm always asked to change the bottle on the water cooler there. So I got this bright idea to just put the bottle on without taking the cap off. I watched and waited, and you should have seen how funny they were. If I only had a video camera or something...someone would go up to it and try to get some water out. And the first time, a little trickle came out, and then of course nothing happened. But everyone could see that the bottle was full. A couple of people tried pushing down on the button harder. They strained and got this totally serious look on their face.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And then this one girl decided to rattle the bottle. She got it rocking back and forth pretty good--I thought she was going to tip it off the cooler completely! Everyone who tried it yelled out, \"The cooler's broken!\" I was totally busting up! So when I thought no one was looking, I fixed it and filled up a big glass full of water and walked around the place drinking it, making sure everyone saw me. Dude, it was so funny!. Hmm, I guess you had to be there. Oh! And Tony has got me to tripping.", "input": "", "output": "Tripping?"}, {"instruction": "Not like drugs!  You know, weird stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Oh.  How is Tony?"}, {"instruction": "I think it's this coping thing he's doing. At least I hope this is only his strange way of coping. Ever since what's-her-name, you know, that bitch? Ever since she dumped him, he's been doing drag. No, he's living in drag. He's the six-foot-tall doll! And he hangs at the drag clubs and goes to drag parties. I think some of them are drag sex parties, too. One minute, he's all into leather, and the next, he's in Barbie doll drag. And you know how scary I find drag queens to be? Tony goes from one extreme to the other, it's kind of like that fine line between love and hate, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Well, what you've described are both really a form of drag."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know, but...oh well. That crazy bitch really fucked him up. Oh how I'd love to get my hands on her! Yeah. Talk about fucking people up...uh, never mind.", "input": "", "output": "What is it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Cecil burst my little bubble the other day.", "input": "", "output": "About Benny?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, about Benny. Well, I thought that he was out for good, but he isn't. They did this appeal, and they got some judge to say that the trial was screwed up.  So Cecil told me that now Benny has to go to trial again. And guess what they want from me?", "input": "", "output": "You're going to have to testify again, aren't you?"}, {"instruction": "Bingo! Okay, so here I am, all worked up over the fact that he's out and free, thinking that I'm all fucked up because of what he did to me and of what he did Roly. And I'm all...I don't know. I thought this was finished. And now...well, now it's all right back in my face again! I feel betrayed all over again, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "And the whole thing is that I hate him and I don't. This love thing just doesn't go away because you want it to, does it? For me, it seems to have stayed behind, lingering in my consciousness, kind of mixed up with pain and disappointment, making my heart burn with agonizing pain, confusing it all with hate and anger. I know that I'm not making any sense. Does that make any sense?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it does, Alex. You need to remember to look back to where you were just a year ago..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know, but...but even though I haven't seen him...actually, I'm not allowed to see him at all--they got another restraining order against him. He can't come near me. And it works the other way around, too. I can't go near him, lucky for us both I guess.", "input": "", "output": "I think that's a good thing."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, you would. So I'm all goofed up over this. Like I've told you before, part of me wants him to rot in hell. He really should be paying the price for all the damage he's caused. And I'm not just talking about the damage he caused me, either.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So I'm thinking about what you said. It's something like that old saying: \"What goes around, comes around.\" But if that were true, then why do they need me? He already slit his own throat with that kid he was busted for and all the videotapes he made. Talk about stupid! What in hell was he thinking when he did that anyway? They have enough on him without me. I'm thinking right now: \"This is total d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\" Haven't we gone over all of this before? Fuck! I can't seem to get away from this! I'm wondering what I did to have this all come back on me again, you know? Why me?", "input": "", "output": "You were the victim, Alex. You were one of many victims. And you should try to remember that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know, but part of me wants to see him so badly. I get all mixed up in this love and hate thing. One part of me wants to make him pay--I want to just crush it out of him with my own hands. And then another part of me wants to figure out a way to make it right with him, so that we can both go on with our lives and not have to look back on all this as some huge monstrous mistake. But I don't think that either option is going to be possible, at least not with him, because he is not going to change. And this is where Ted comes into the picture.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He looks so much like Benny; it's eerie sometimes. And they have a lot in common, too. Well, not a lot really, but a few things are similar besides their looks. Ted is into the Weather Channel, just like Benny was. And Ted finds it so funny that the average temperature in San Francisco is sixty-nine degrees. Benny always laughed about that, too. I never paid attention to stuff like that. Both of them say that sixty-nine is the appropriate temperature for this town with all the fags running around here. It really struck me that they both said this. And another similarity is their perception of the bleeding heart liberals that seem to be everywhere here, too.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "The other day, Ted and I were riding on the Muni, and we came upon some animal rights activists in front of Boston Market. They were all holding up signs, \"Animals are our friends\" and \"Go veggie.\" It was all shit like that. I know you've seen them, too. Well, Ted just opened up his mouth and said, \"Do you think that if animals had the chance, they wouldn't be eating us?\" Well, not only did I nearly fall over laughing, but later, I realized that's something that Benny would have said, too. It's so strange how similar they are to one another. The big difference is that Ted doesn't go around accosting young boys like Benny did...or does. As far as I know, Ted doesn't do that. I hope he doesn't do that, otherwise I'd have to kick his ass, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Let's hope not."}, {"instruction": "So, it's too bizarre sometimes. Oh well, I guess this Benny thing is so far from over for me, uh?", "input": "", "output": "Unfortunately, I do think you have a way to go on this."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, a real long way to go.", "input": "", "output": "But I think you're doing the right thing by talking to me about all of your feelings about this. Remember that whatever you feel is okay."}, {"instruction": "You are so clich\u00e9, you know? Uh, I'm sorry. I know you're just trying to help.", "input": "", "output": "No offense taken, Alex."}, {"instruction": "So, where were we? Uh, I don't know. Oh! I forgot to tell you about Ralph. This is real exciting! Remember I told you that he went on the radiation treatment and that he was not doing so well with that?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I remember. How is he doing?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he's still sick as a rabid dog. I keep calling him the incredible glowing man because he's so pale. But the doctors told him that the size of the tumor has shrunk down to almost nothing, and that is such great news, you know?", "input": "", "output": "That's good news, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Ralph is pretty skeptical still, though.", "input": "", "output": "Understandably."}, {"instruction": "But this is totally a good thing. He still has a few weeks of radiation to go, but it looks pretty good. Miracles do happen sometimes! I remember when I told him that I don't want to inherit any of his stuff, that he needs to stay alive and keep all his shit. And now, it looks like he may just do that. So with all this other shit going on right now, at least Ralph is coming out of it. Now he won't be bagging on me.", "input": "", "output": "This's very good news, Alex. I'm very happy to hear that Ralph is doing better."}, {"instruction": "So am I, dude, so am I. Well, I've got to be going now. Ralph said he felt like a real meal tonight, and I promised to make him something special. So I need to get over to the store to pick up some groceries for dinner before it gets too late and he changes his mind. I hope you don't mind if I cut things short today.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine, Alex. It's just a couple of minutes.  We'll see each other next week."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, thanks a lot, dude. I'll see you later.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Alex."}, {"instruction": "You too, man. Bye!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "This is nothing! Just take a look at this. See all the bruises? And it still hurts, too.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "The beginning of the end--that's what happened.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "Friday night, I was walking home from the Alliance when Benny comes to a screaming stop in his car, cutting the sidewalk off in front of me.", "input": "", "output": "Oh no..."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes! My heart totally started pounding. We're not even supposed to be seeing each other--the restraining order and everything. And then he went and made this spectacle of himself, in public. It wasn't like no one else saw that, you know?", "input": "", "output": "You're right, it was wrong of him to try to seek contact with you. What did he want?"}, {"instruction": "Tell me! He demanded that I get into the car with him. And I was all, \"No thanks, dude!\" And I kept on walking. Then he pulled out into the street and started pacing me with his car, telling me that all he wants to do is talk to me. I tried to look away, to ignore him, but then finally, I gave up and got into the car.", "input": "", "output": "Oh Alex, you didn't."}, {"instruction": "I did. And that was my big mistake. But I told him, \"Okay, you want to talk to me, so talk.\" Well, we drove to his house. He started by telling me about jail, about the things that happened to him there. The way he was acting, it seemed like he was high on something. He asked me, \"Do you know what they did to me in there?\" I told him that I didn't care and that he deserved it, whatever it was. Then he slapped me, hard. He never did that before, he never hit me like that. I was furious, so I hit him back, harder.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "But wait, it gets worse. Before I knew it, he started ranting and raving about everything: about Dora leaving him and taking his baby away; about the prison and how he was beaten and raped; about what I did to his prized car. He was crazed. I knew he was getting dangerous--this love is dangerous, it always was. He blamed me for all of it, for testifying against him. But I just laughed at him. That's when he went off and started chasing me through the house as I stumbled over the furniture. I got to the door when he caught me by the arms and pulled me to him. And then he kissed me roughly. I pulled back and spit in his face--I always wanted to do that. That's when things took a turn for the worse. We started struggling, and before I knew it, we were tumbling down the stairs.", "input": "", "output": "Oh..."}, {"instruction": "I think this was when something in me just snapped. I landed on top of him, and he was knocked out cold. I was certain he would kill me, if I didn't do something first. So I pulled the strand of Christmas lights from around the window and hog-tied him, wrists to ankles, and I dragged him up the stairs and back into the house. I found a knife and the video camera...", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "I know! I know! I noticed he was bleeding from a gash on the back of his head, the carpet was soaking it up. I finally felt some sense of power over him. So I sat, rocking back and forth, thinking what to do next. I hurt all over from the fall, and my hands were all scraped up. I knew I wanted to make him pay, and now I had my chance. I was certain he wanted to kill me. He told me it was all my fault for testifying against him, for betraying him. Then I thought about Roly and how he died. I was crazy at that point myself. And then Benny started to wake up. I heard him moan, and it took him a minute to realize he was tied up. He tried to struggle free, but he couldn't. He screamed for me to untie him, I just laughed and told him it was payback time. I put the camera on the tripod and pointed it at him. Then, with the knife, I cut off his shirt and then his pants as he whimpered and started to beg me to let him loose. He promised to leave me alone. But I was all, \"Right, sure you will!\" So I kicked him. Then I ran the knife blade over his face and down his throat and chest. I asked him how it felt to be so powerless. He was crying, and I loved it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "At that point, I went into the kitchen to look for something...I don't remember what anymore. Just then, the doorbell rang, and Benny yelled out, \"Help me!\" I heard the door crash open. I thought it was the police, so I ran out the back door. I just ran and ran. I was so afraid to get into trouble. I ran up the hill to the top of Twin Peaks and looked out over the city. It was a spectacularly clear night--so rare. Everything glittered and sparkled. Then I broke down--I realized just what I'd done and how crazy it all was. I cried and cried. I knew this could be a whole lot of trouble. I was shaking, and I hurled my guts out. Then, all of a sudden, I heard this voice call out my name, it was Katherine! She drove up there by herself to see the view and saw me. She wrapped her arms around me, and I cried some more while she held me. We drove down the hill, and I pretty much told her everything that happened. She called her doctor friend, Elgin, and we went over to his clinic so he could look me over. He took some pictures of me and said I was fine--bruised, but okay.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. It was very lucky to run into Katherine..."}, {"instruction": "I know. We went to her penthouse afterwards. I was still shaking all over, and I was sick to my stomach. I took a long hot bath--she has this cool round bathtub. I had cuts and bruises all over my body. See my hands?", "input": "", "output": "I noticed that. I also noticed the bruises around your throat."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and I don't even remember Benny choking me. Anyway, Katherine took my clothes--they were torn and bloodied--and gave me some of Philip's clothes she had. They were a good fit actually. Katherine gave me some hot chocolate and some food, and then I slept in her guest bedroom. I woke up around five in the morning after a horrible nightmare. I couldn't get back to sleep again. I kept thinking about Benny and what I did to him. That was when I realized that my backpack was still at his house. So I decided that I needed to go back and get it.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Alex..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know--it was a bad idea. But I needed to see him for some reason. I knew what I did was very wrong, and I felt guilty about it. I felt real bad. I came to his house just as dawn was breaking. I noticed right away that the lights were still on and the door lay open, but there was no one inside. The tripod with the camera was toppled over on the floor. The house was wrecked from our fight. But Benny was gone. Blood stained the carpet and smeared the stairs. I knew that something was wrong. It was more than what I had done.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I gathered up my backpack and turned to leave. Just then, the next door neighbor pulled up in his car. I don't know if he saw me, but he was looking up at the house, and so I went out the back door again and walked home.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "As I walked, I thought about what I did, about what happened, and I felt sick again. I didn't hurl that time. I knew what I did was wrong. It was so wrong. I felt...no, I feel terrible about it. I wanted to tell Benny that I was sorry. I knew that things had gone too far this time, that it was too late. When I got to the house, Katherine was there, waiting for me. She practically wore a hole in the carpet.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure she was very worried."}, {"instruction": "Katherine said that if she knew where Benny lived, she would have gone there herself--she said that she knew that I must have gone there. She told me to call Cecil, that I might need him. She offered to help me in any way she could. She kept telling me to call the police, but I didn't want to do that. What could they do to me? In addition to attacking me, Benny practically kidnapped me!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, Katherine was right--you need to go to the police and tell them what happened, if you haven't already..."}, {"instruction": "Katherine was right...", "input": "", "output": "About what?"}, {"instruction": "That I needed Cecil. Last Sunday, I went back to Benny's again.", "input": "", "output": "Alex! Why?"}, {"instruction": "I needed to see if he was there. Something wasn't right when I went to get my backpack. If nothing else, I figured whoever broke through Benny's door helped him get untied, and so Benny would have been freed by then. Right? When I got to Benny's house, the house was all cordoned off with that yellow police tape, and the front door was shut. I didn't dare cross over the tape.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "So I needed Cecil--the police came looking for me. On Monday, my mom called and asked me to come to her house right away. She didn't say for what, but she insisted I come immediately. When I got there, I knew I had been ambushed--the police were there. They wanted to know what I was doing at Benny's house. I mean fuck me! I was so stupid! The tape! The goddamned videotape--I left it in the machine. And now they have it--they have me on the tape torturing Benny as he struggled and whimpered.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Alex!"}, {"instruction": "They wanted to know where Benny was because he's missing! I asked the cop what else they saw on that tape, you know? If they had me and all that stuff on tape, then they must have had that other guy...whoever it was that broke into Benny's house.  Because whoever that person was, he was the one who got Benny. But they wouldn't say one way or another. I asked about fingerprints. Well, they have real good ones of me, that's for sure!", "input": "", "output": "Were you arrested?"}, {"instruction": "Almost, I think. They told me to stay around for more questions. Right now, Benny is just a missing person. But if he turns up dead or something, I could be in big trouble. Now I wish I had just kept on walking that night. Now I wish I didn't go there with him. See what he does? He makes me into a crazy person, into someone who would do anything without thinking.", "input": "", "output": "I hope they find Benny alive, Alex. Hmm. You know I'm surprised..."}, {"instruction": "You are? Well, I'm not. I knew I had it in me. I just never thought I'd actually go through with it. I never thought I'd have a chance to get back at him that way. But now...now I wonder what happened to him? Where did Benny go? And who was it that broke down his door? Whoever it was, he must be with him, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "I imagine so. You are telling me everything, Alex?"}, {"instruction": "Dude! How can you even think that? Of course I told you everything! I wouldn't...no, I couldn't do that! You think I killed him? Jeez! Thanks a whole fucking lot, dude! I thought you were on my side!", "input": "", "output": "I am, Alex. I am on your side. But you are a prime suspect in a criminal investigation, Alex. The police have you on tape torturing Benny. You have the motive and the opportunity. Did you tell the police everything you told me?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I told them everything, just like I've told you and Katherine. But they don't believe me. And you don't believe me either. At least Katherine is on my side!", "input": "", "output": "That's not the point, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Okay, so tell me, what is the point?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, if Benny turns up dead, you are a murder suspect. If he turns up hurt, you are an attempted murder suspect. If he turns up okay, you might be thought of as a potential victim. Maybe."}, {"instruction": "I never thought about that.", "input": "", "output": "You need to think about everything, Alex. Benny may come back to fulfill his own revenge fantasy against you."}, {"instruction": "Well, thanks a whole fucking lot again, dude! Now I won't ever sleep again!", "input": "", "output": "Maybe you can stay somewhere...somewhere he doesn't know about..."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I bet Katherine would let me stay at her place. No, that's no good. She may be in danger too if I do that.", "input": "", "output": "Good point. Alex, you need legal help, and I think you need to ask for police protection. You need to think..."}, {"instruction": "Stop, okay? Just, stop. I know I need to think. I know that already, but isn't it a little late to remind me? Please don't make me feel worse about all of this.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex. I don't mean to make you feel worse. I know how bad you must be feeling already."}, {"instruction": "Well, I need to go and figure out what to do next.", "input": "", "output": "Call Cecil, he is the one who can help you the most now, or at least he can recommend someone who might."}, {"instruction": "That's a good idea. I think I'll go over to his office right now.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Well, all right, Alex. Please call me if you need anything, anything at all."}, {"instruction": "Okay, dude. Sorry I'm such a disappointment to you...", "input": "", "output": "You aren't, Alex. You aren't."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'll see you later then...", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex. And if you need me, I'm right here. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "You can cut the nicey-nice bullshit, Doc! How the hell do you think I am? You know, no one knows how I feel except for Katherine; even you didn't believe me.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, it's not that I didn't believe you, I just had a strong sense that there was something missing in what you told me about your last encounter with Benny."}, {"instruction": "See? There you go again! There you fucking go! I told them coming here was useless, but no! Cecil said I absolutely must come here to see you--I have to keep coming here if I want to get out of this...this...this stupid bullshit! So, you don't believe me, do you? You want to know why I went off the way I did? Why did I really go off like that? You want me to tell you the real reason?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do want you to tell me, Alex. I want you to tell me everything."}, {"instruction": "Okay, so here goes. All right, first, let me say that Katherine was after me over this since the first night, that fateful night. Even Elgin said I needed to do it, but I...I don't...no, I mean I didn't want to tell anyone, I really didn't. But Katherine said I had to, she said that I owed it to myself, whatever that meant. You know, if it weren't for her, I wouldn't be here right now. I'd still be in jail, did you know that?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I knew that Katherine posted the bail to get you out. Your mother told me."}, {"instruction": "Oh shit! Why did you have to go and bring her up? That fucking bitch! She wanted me to stay in there and rot, you know? She didn't even care! It's the same old story with her...what did I expect anyway? What did I fucking expect from her? She'll never change; she'll always think the worst of me! I couldn't even talk to her--she was so irrational, I just had to ignore her.", "input": "", "output": "How was she irrational?"}, {"instruction": "I told you how! She told me she was coming here to see you, and she did, didn't she?", "input": "", "output": "She did."}, {"instruction": "I can tell by the look on your face that she gave you a bunch of shit, too, didn't she?", "input": "", "output": "She wasn't happy about your situation, but I think you already know that."}, {"instruction": "Did she tell you that I'm not allowed at her house anymore? That I can't even see my own little brother again? Even Mark is pissed off. Everyone is pissed at me, even Ralph. That's why I'm staying with Katherine right now. She's my saving grace, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Katherine cares a great deal about you and what happens to you."}, {"instruction": "Well, she posted a lot of money to get me out. Before she did it, she came to me in jail and told me how important it was for her and for me not to bag on her and run off. She said it would be a huge betrayal if I ran off, not that I was thinking about doing that. Where would I go? But she told me that she trusted me to do the right thing--to go to court when I'm supposed to and to take responsibility for what I did. Katherine really knows how to make me see things with a clear head. You know, since I've been staying with her, I haven't even had the urge to go on one of my long walks in the middle of the night.", "input": "", "output": "That's encouraging."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess. And she feeds me, too. She said she doesn't want me to get sick on top of everything else. She keeps urging me, almost haranguing me, to tell the whole story to the police and to totally come clean. And I keep saying that I didn't want to do that because...well, because I am so embarrassed.", "input": "", "output": "What are you embarrassed about? Is it about what you did to Benny?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah, it's that too. But mostly it's what he did to me and why I went off so badly...", "input": "", "output": "Well?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. All right. I guess I can...I mean...I know I can tell you. He...uh, he did it again, you know? He...hmm...well, he...he...uh, he practically tore my shirt right off me. He must have really built his muscles up while he was in jail. I just thought he got skinny, but no, he got buffed up, all muscular. He was so much stronger than I was, and it caught me by surprise.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, did Benny..."}, {"instruction": "No kidding. Okay, so he raped me, I guess...", "input": "", "output": "You guess?"}, {"instruction": "Yes! Okay? He raped me, and that was the reason I went off on him! I wasn't going to let him get away with something like that again. I was so stupid to even get in the car with him. So stupid! It's all my fault, you know? If only...well, if I just hadn't gotten into that damned car, none of this would have happened. I wouldn't be in this mess right now. And he wouldn't have done it to me. Katherine and Doctor Elgin talked to the police about it. I didn't know until after they did it, but Katherine said they had no choice. Elgin took evidence from me...off me...whatever. He took pictures and some physical evidence to prove what Benny did. And they had to tell the police about what they knew. Katherine said she didn't want to betray my trust in her, but the police kind of forced it. And the truth needed to come out anyway. I guess she was right, after all.", "input": "", "output": "I agree, they had to tell the police what happened. Alex..."}, {"instruction": "Well, at first, I kind of blew up at her. But then...well, you know the way Katherine is--she calmed me down and made me see it her way--made me see it clearly. I don't blame her for it. She couldn't have kept quiet about it for too long anyway. She knew too much as it was. And Elgin, doing what he does--being a doctor in that clinic place--well, it was his legal responsibility to report this to the police. Well, that's what Katherine said. But...well, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I feel real stupid. I feel like I deserved all this, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you didn't deserve to be raped..."}, {"instruction": "But I got into the car with him. I was practically asking for it! I got exactly what I deserved!", "input": "", "output": "No, Alex. No, you didn't. Getting into Benny's car was definitely not a good idea. But you didn't deserve being raped. Alex, you do hear me?"}, {"instruction": "I heard you, but this doesn't change how I feel! If only I had moved a little faster! If only I hadn't gotten tripped up like that! Shit! He caught up to me and threw himself on me. It was...it was like he...uh, he was out of control! I'm certain he was on something, probably crank. He was so sweaty and like a mad dog, practically foaming at the mouth. I can still feel his hot breath on my throat. God, that hot bath at Katherine's...well, let's just say that no amount of scrubbing can ever get me clean. Everything ached and burned. I totally felt raw inside. And there was a good amount of blood and...well...uh, I'm...uh, I'm sorry. It's just...it's so not like me to get like this.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. Here, take some tissues. It wasn't your fault, Alex. Alex?"}, {"instruction": "Fuck me! Yes, it was my fault! I brought it all on myself. And then I had to go and make it worse by turning the tables on him! The only thing I didn't do was rape him back. I just wanted him to feel a little pain and to realize he didn't have any power over me any more. But the funny thing is, I don't know what I would have done if that person, whoever it was, hadn't broke through the front door just then. I was so fucking crazed myself, and that's what scares me--I still can't believe I went off so badly. And then to do that thing with the video camera...I must have been crazy or stupid! That was the stupidest thing I ever did in my life!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, do you know if the person who broke through Benny's front door was captured on camera?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm? What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "The police probably have that person on tape, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Funny, I forgot about that. Cecil did say something about that, too. But I don't remember what. He did say something. So they found Benny all beaten up and in a coma. See? On the tape, they would be able to see that he wasn't all beat up when I was torturing him, because I didn't beat him up. I just terrorized him a bit, that's all. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! See? It's all so easy. Too easy! He didn't get beat up by me. It's on the tape! They're not going to be able to make all these charges stick, you know? None of it! Even Cecil said there's too much in my favor. Benny practically kidnapped me. He assaulted and raped me. Man! You know I bled for like four days straight after that, and I had a hard time...well...uh, I had a little trouble going to the bathroom, too. I'm so ashamed of myself! This is too ridiculous. Look at me. People like me don't get raped. That only happens to women. No one would believe this. I can't tell my mother or Mark about it. I can't! No matter what I say, my mom is just going to think I started it all with Benny anyway. She'll think that I was the instigator. But I was even afraid to tell you about it. Can you believe that? You! I tell you everything, and I was too ashamed to tell you!", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you told me, Alex. You can tell me anything. I'm not going to judge you. I care about what happens to you, Alex. And men do get raped, too, Alex. It happens all the time, unfortunately. And shame and embarrassment are natural reactions to..."}, {"instruction": "Well, now I got to wait like six months before I can get an accurate AIDS test, and that scares me. I keep having dreams that I'm going to have it. Shit, I look at Tony and Ralph and think I'm going to go through what they are going through, all the pills, all the crap. And Tony isn't doing so hot these days. He's having trouble with his eyes or something, I don't know. They say it's AIDS-related. But anyway, I just don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, did you tell the police what you've told me?"}, {"instruction": "Cecil took me to talk to the DA, but I don't think it did any good. I think they were waiting for Benny to die or something so they could try to get me for murder. But luckily, he woke up the other day.", "input": "", "output": "He did?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but he doesn't remember anything about that night, or so he says. Ralph went to see him. He said that Benny was all happy to see him. And according to what Ralph said, he acted like nothing had happened. His speech was slow, but he asked about me and wanted to know why I hadn't come to see him. But I'm all...I don't know...I find it hard to believe that Benny's got amnesia. I think he's probably playing one of his games again.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. It's quite possible that he doesn't remember what happened that night. That's a common side effect of coma. And sometimes, the human mind tries to protect the person from the memory of the trauma..."}, {"instruction": "Really? Hmm. I didn't know that. I never knew anyone who was in a coma before. I have known brain-dead people, but not comatose people. At least he didn't die. That's a positive on my side. I never really wanted him to die. I just wanted him to suffer a little, and I guess I got my wish, you know? So now I don't know where all this is going to go. Part of me wants to go see him myself, but I can't do that.", "input": "", "output": "That wouldn't be wise, Alex.  I strongly recommend against it."}, {"instruction": "Well, Ralph told me they have a guard outside his room anyway. And as fucking crazed as I have been, I don't really know what I may do next. Lucky for me, Katherine is sticking to my side right now. She's like the only person in the world I can count on, and I've been just a raw nerve lately. Every time she comes into the room, I practically jump through the roof. I wish she didn't have to work. When she went back to work finally, I didn't know what to do with myself while she was gone. That first morning she was gone, I sat in the bathtub and cried my eyes out until I had a headache. She gave me her pager number just in case, and she called me every other hour to check. That made me feel better. But...well, I feel bad that I let her down, too, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think she looks at it like that, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's still in the back of my mind anyway.", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "Well, she's probably waiting for me to get back to her place right now. I don't want to be late, she'll get so worried about me. Oh! Did I tell you she's moving into that new place this weekend? We got a bunch of guys--the burliest bunch I could round up--and we're going to move her over there in one day. What she has in the penthouse right now will hardly fill the house, so it shouldn't take very long really.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. It would be good for you to do some physical work--you'll get your body tired and your mind might get some rest."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess. Well, I'll talk to you later, dude!", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Alex. I'll see you next week. But if you need me..."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know. Bye, Doc!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. Please have a seat."}, {"instruction": "I'm so not into this, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "This! This...uh, whatever it is that we do here. I'm so not into talking today. Well? Aren't you going to say something instead of looking at me like that?", "input": "", "output": "What would you like me to say, Alex?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Shit! Everything is totally messed up, you know? So messed up. My life is a mess and...well, I think I may need to find myself somewhere else to sleep, on top of everything else.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Because...just because. Okay, so I sense that something is up with Katherine, but she's not letting on. But I can just sense it, you know? It's like...it's...well, it's kind of like when you have this feeling inside and you can't really explain what it is or what it means, but you know it's there. It's that kind of feeling. Plus, Ralph called and asked me when I was coming home.", "input": "", "output": "What did you tell him?"}, {"instruction": "I told him I didn't know. He came down pretty damn hard on me for what happened with Benny, especially after he saw Benny in the hospital. I felt like he thought I was the one who beat him up like that. It was like he didn't really believe me. And he said some things that were pretty unforgivable. But now he wants me to come home.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to go back to Ralph?"}, {"instruction": "Hello? Haven't you been listening to me? He was so not nice to me, dude, so not nice. No one but Katherine believed me, not even you at first. But I think you believe me now, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "I believe that Benny kidnapped and assualted you, Alex.  I believe that none of this would have happened if Benny hadn't lured you into his car."}, {"instruction": "But you don't really believe all of it, do you? Oh, it's all right. I'm getting used to this by now. I kind of feel like a pariah. I should have a sign around my neck that says, \"Kick me.\" And Ted...well, he pretty much bailed on me. I think it freaked him out when he heard what I did to Benny, and he totally bagged. No explanation. No excuses. No nothing! It's like what was I thinking anyway?", "input": "", "output": "I don't understand what you mean."}, {"instruction": "What in hell was I thinking getting involved with Ted? He looked like Benny. He talked like Benny. He was Benny's mirror image. I'm so into this self-torture thing. I look for people who will treat me bad. So now, it's like I have nobody. I wonder if I ever did.", "input": "", "output": "I'm here for you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. You only say that because you're getting paid. I know what time here means, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Not true, Alex. I do care about you, and I am here for you."}, {"instruction": "Right. I bet you say that to all your patients, you're supposed to say that. You know, I should just go now!", "input": "", "output": "No, Alex! Sit down, please! Look, I know what a difficult situation you are in right now, I know how hard it must seem. But running away from the people who are here to help you is not the answer. Talking it out, facing life head on is what going to make the difference. I'm here to hear you out and help you. And I do this because I care about you, not just because it's my job. I'm not going to leave you, Alex. I'm sticking with you, and we'll see it through together. Understand?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah, I guess. Dude, I never saw you get like that before. You can be pretty butch when you want, you know that? Wow! Makes me shiver when you deliver! Dude! I think I need a drink of water, or if you got something stronger...", "input": "", "output": "Water!"}, {"instruction": "Oh, all right! Thanks, man. So now what?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "What do I do now? How do I make this mess go away? Every day, I'm haunted by these new memories. They intrude on me when I least expect it. It's so unforgiving how they creep into my thoughts.", "input": "", "output": "This is why it's important that we talk about this. By talking this out, you'll not only acknowledge your feelings, you'll also learn to accept them and come to terms with, and eventually, you'll learn to live with them."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I hadn't thought of it like that. Well, this funny thing happened the other day after we came back from our boat ride to the Farallon Islands.", "input": "", "output": "When did you go out there?"}, {"instruction": "On Sunday. Katherine took Philip and me as a way of saying thank you for helping her move.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, we moved her in last Saturday. It went pretty smoothly, too. Well, except for the truck breaking down. You should have seen it. We were halfway across the city when the stupid rental truck just died. I was so pissed. But Katherine...well, she just handled it. I'm telling you! She whipped out her cell phone, got the rental company on the line, and chewed them a new asshole for giving us a piece of shit truck, all the while with a smile on her face. She knows how to talk to people to get what she wants. She was like, \"Oh, God.\" I mean ho-hum! She was way cool about it. And all the guys...that was a sight! All these muscle-queens were out there standing around the truck, scratching their heads and of course, no one had the slightest idea of what to do. But Katherine just went, \"Easy as that!\" Then she grabbed the donuts and started eating one. Nothing rattles her. Before I knew it, a new truck was delivered and everything moved in no time. The best part of the day was what happened to Philip.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he's not much for moving furniture, so he kind of hung at the house, arranging things, trying to wire up the stereo. And he hasn't got a clue, really. He was making a mess of it. So Troy came walking in with an eye on Philip, chest out, and all pumped up. He thought he had it totally going on, and he took control and got the thing working. But Philip didn't have a clue that Troy was trying to seduce him with his cocky know-how and big muscles. Philip was like some wide-eyed kid watching Troy. Troy thought he was all that and a bag of chips! They would have made a cute couple, though. Katherine and I were laughing. We weren't sure who was funnier, Philip or Troy. And I don't think Philip ever did get a clue. When I finally told Troy that Philip was straight, he didn't believe me, or he didn't want to believe me. He was so out there! Anyway, what was I suppose to be talking about?", "input": "", "output": "Your trip to the Farallons."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, right. Actually, it's what happened after we got back. It was pretty cold on Sunday, and Katherine wanted a fire in her fireplace. I remembered seeing some wood in the backyard and an axe, so I went out back and started chopping wood, except this one log wouldn't split. I had a hell of a time with it, but I kept trying anyway. I was hell-bent to get it split. Finally, when it broke open, inside, there was a stump that was blackened. The thing must have been in a fire at some point, but the tree lived, and a new bark grew around the burnt part, sealing it inside. I had a major epiphany from that.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it stood as a metaphor, really. This is how I saw it. This tree was wounded in a fire, but it lived anyway. Eventually, it grew new bark, encompassing the wound. People do the same thing--we get hurt, but we go on, and like the burnt tree, we carry on building layer on top of layer. The scar eventually gets covered up and heals, but it's still there deep inside, only we grow stronger--that's why the log was so hard to split. The thing is I'm like that. We all are, I guess. And what I realized was that sometimes, with a lot of effort and chipping away, those buried scars could be reopened forcing a person...forcing me to face it again and maybe to learn some lesson from it or something.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think you have learned, Alex?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I thought about Benny and me. And \"an eye for an eye\" isn't always the right answer, and it probably never is. I was wrong, so wrong. Now I may pay big time for my wrongness. I should have gotten out of there and went straight to the police, like Katherine said, but I let the pain make me crazy mad and...well, you know the rest.", "input": "", "output": "So what now?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, dude. Ralph told me that Benny called, asking for me. He said that Benny still doesn't remember what happened and wants to talk to me. I know I can't go there, I just can't. It chills me to even think about it, about seeing him, about talking to him again. I realize that some people, like Benny, have this twisted need to control and dominate other people, wounding them in the process.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "You are acknowledging your mistakes, and at the same time, you are realizing the impact of the violation done to you. You are sharing your fear and anger with me and others who care about you. You are making an effort to regain some control over your life. And you did all of this with very little help from me."}, {"instruction": "I did all that? Hmm. Wow! Okay, dude, you're getting kind of deep now.", "input": "", "output": "I want you to understand, Alex, that there is no right or wrong way to react to the pain that you went though. But it's important not to push away the people who care about you. You need the support, Alex. You need help--my help and the help of others--to get though this. It's too hard to heal on your own."}, {"instruction": "Okay, dude, I get what you mean.", "input": "", "output": "Good. We've accomplished quite a lot today. So much for not wanting to talk, hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Somehow, dude, you bring it out of me. I don't know how you do it, but you do. Katherine does that, too. Oh well.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Alex, we're out of time for today. I'll see you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, see you then!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex, take care of yourself."}, {"instruction": "Hey, dude. You don't have to say it. I know I look tired, and I am. I'm tired. I'm thirsty. I'm wild-eyed. You name it.", "input": "", "output": "Here. Here's a glass of water. Tell me what's going on."}, {"instruction": "Like I said, you name it! I just saw Cecil and my fucking mother.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, her! You and I have that psychic energy when it comes to her, you know that?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Well, as soon as I mentioned her, you got that look you get. Your face totally changed. You like her as much as I do, I can tell. It's okay, you don't have to say one way or another, but...well, I don't know. We'll just leave it at that, okay? So yeah, I went to see Cecil, and my mom tried to steam roll over us.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I had an appointment with Cecil so we could talk about the hearing that's coming up and what I need to do to be prepared for it. But my mom...well, she's just my mom! Same old, same old, and she'll never change. She started some shit with Katherine again, too, I think.", "input": "", "output": "Did Katherine tell you that?"}, {"instruction": "No, I haven't seen her since...uh, I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought. Oh! My mom chewed me out for not being at Katherine's when she called. And I'm certain that Katherine didn't enjoy the ten thousand phone calls from her either. But my mom...well, she called around everywhere looking for me, being the bitch that only she can be.", "input": "", "output": "Why didn't you take her calls when she called?"}, {"instruction": "I've told you, I haven't been there. I mean...uh...well, I'm not at...uh...oops!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, what's going on? What are you not telling me?"}, {"instruction": "Shit! Sometimes I can be so stupid, and my lips get too loose, you know? Well, I kind of split Katherine's.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Remember when I told you that I sensed something was up with Katherine? Ever since we got her moved into the new place, I had this feeling...so I wrote her a note Monday--while she was here with you--and left.", "input": "", "output": "Did you go back to Ralph's?"}, {"instruction": "Um, yeah. That's it, Ralph's.", "input": "", "output": "Alex! Tell me the truth."}, {"instruction": "No...I mean, yes, but not for long, really. I just went there and got my laptop and some clothes and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "So where are you staying now?"}, {"instruction": "With a friend.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What did you tell Katherine in your note?"}, {"instruction": "Just that...well, that I felt like I didn't want to be more trouble than I had already been and that I needed to go away for awhile. I told her I'd call her in a few days when I got settled, but I haven't had a chance to do that yet.", "input": "", "output": "To get settled or to call her?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Both, I guess. I've been kind of feeling like I'm reeling or something. Everything is moving so fast. And now that I'm all alone, I notice every little thing, every noise, every movement going on outside, stuff like that. I keep going around checking the door to make sure it's locked. And I keep feeling like I'm going to fall apart. I know none of this makes any sense, but I just didn't want to put Katherine through any more...uh, well...I'm sorry. It's just it's...well...uh, shit!", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Alex. Here's a tissue."}, {"instruction": "I...uh, I don't know what's wrong with me, you know? One minute I'm okay, the next, I'm crying like a baby. I feel like I'm losing my mind.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you've gone through a very traumatic situation and I think that what you're describing may be caused by that event.  You're describing symptoms of something we call Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. When people go through a serious trauma, as you have, they sometimes suffer in a way you've just described. And I can tell you are not sleeping well again. How are you eating?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I haven't had a chance to...uh, to get some food or anything yet. I just got myself into the condo this morning. Last night, I slept at this sleazy hotel in the Tenderloin, if you can call that sleeping--it was so fucking noisy. But Luke...well, he has been great about all of this.", "input": "", "output": "Luke? I thought he moved back East?"}, {"instruction": "He did. He's in New York right now, but he still owns his condo here, in San Francisco. He's letting me stay there, rent free. He told the building manager to give me the spare key. Pretty nice of him, huh?", "input": "", "output": "It is. Alex, you have many people that really care a great deal about you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, so many people...everyone but my...uh, my...well...uh, you know. Shit! I just don't know, you know? Every hour of fear I spend, I...but then...well, I don't know. It's just that...well, it's like...geez! I can't even think clearly! I hate being alone. I just hate it! The other night, I went to the movies all by myself. I saw two movies, and then I walked all over town, not knowing what I should do or where I should go. I ended up sitting there in my place, under the girders at the bridge, all night long, just thinking about things. It seems that no matter where I go or what I do, I bring trouble with me. I've fucked things up with Katherine. I know I have.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And Benny...well, he's just Benny--stupid as ever. And I even messed things up there, more than big time. Ralph probably hates me by now. I just don't want to be any more trouble to anyone. Everybody would be better off if I just fell off the face of the Earth, or got run down by a fast moving truck, or something. I know my mom would be pleased if that happened--I wouldn't be the major disappointment that I am to her any more, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Alex, that's pretty harsh. Would you give me your phone number and address at Luke's place?"}, {"instruction": "Why? So you can check up on me or something? I'm not going to hurt myself, if that's what you're thinking.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. But I am somewhat concerned. Are you sure you won't do anything rash?"}, {"instruction": "Dude, you should know by now that I have always been a storm. I'll get over myself, eventually. Do you know what the worst part of all of this is? It's that we live in a world where people find it easy to be mean-spirited and nasty. We all have the capacity for both kindness and cruelty, especially me--and that bothers the hell out of me. Look at what I did, at how crazy I became. I feel so guilty about it, and there's nothing I can do to fix it or take it back. But I want to take it back so badly.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I guess that this is where the learning begins. This is the point where I tell myself: \"Never again.\" I guess it's important to remember all the possibilities I still have ahead of me. Life won't always be pain and suffering, right? I'll grow stronger from this. I will find hope again.", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "Well, at least I got the revenge factor out of my system, but at what price? That's what's been on my mind, too. At what price?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm glad to hear you aren't still having revenge fantasies.  When you think in terms of revenge and hostility..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it only puts me in an endless cycle of going around in mental circles. It's so self-defeating, it holds back my spirit. Someday, I'll look back at all of this, and I think I'll realize just how blind and irrational it all really was.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's the same thing with making rash decisions, like the way I left Katherine's.", "input": "", "output": "I agree. So what are you going to do about that?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I need to call her right away, huh?", "input": "", "output": "That would be the considerate thing to do. I'm sure she is very worried about you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I suppose so. Shit! I am such an idiot sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "No, Alex. You just need to stop and think before you act."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know. But how many times do you have to remind me? You'd think I would have memorized that concept by now. Well, I guess I'll call her tonight, when I get back to the condo. Here, I'll write down the address and number for you.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I didn't finish telling you about my mom and Cecil.", "input": "", "output": "Oh yes, what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I went to see Cecil before I came here today. And while we were talking, my mom slammed open the door and barged in like a mad woman. She was so pathetic! So she interrupted us and started yelling at me, \"How could you do this?\" It was all shit like that. She was ranting and raving, and finally, Cecil said, \"Larraine, shut up!\" And she just stood there, with her mouth opened in shock. She hasn't been told to shut up nearly enough in her life, the bitch! But that caught me off guard, too, you know? I didn't expect Cecil to say something like that, but he had had enough of her, too--all her endless phone calls, and bitching, and all the other stuff. He told her, \"Sit down!\" And she just sort of crumbled into her chair.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So he laid it out for us. The tape the police have is proof that I didn't beat Benny up as badly as he was found to be. According to Cecil, when that person kicked open the front door, the camera got knocked over, but it was still running, only it was filming the ceiling or something. But they got a voice on tape, and it wasn't mine. So now the police are looking for someone else, a man.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "And a day or so before he was so badly beaten up, Benny was in a couple of fights, and someone had left a message on his voice mail, threatening him. And it's the same voice as on the videotape. They have all this evidence that proves that I wasn't the one who put Benny in a coma. So Cecil thinks that they'll drop most of the case against me. There's still the matter of aggravated assault and torture, but Cecil seems to think that it will be dropped to a lesser charge. And they may even end up filing charges against Benny for breaking the restraining order and assaulting me, at least that's what Cecil hopes for. So it looks pretty good as long as Cecil can put up a good argument and convince the judge of all this.", "input": "", "output": "Let's hope, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you and me both, dude! You and me both. My mom just sat there with her stupid mouth shut. When I got up to leave, she stopped me and started to say something, but I just told her not to start with me, I didn't want to hear anymore. For a minute there, she looked almost defeated and sunk back down into her chair. Then she said...and I, uh...well, I don't know. It's too strange, really. But it kind of tugged at my heart a little, too. And I got choked up, like I'm getting now.", "input": "", "output": "What did she say to you?"}, {"instruction": "She told me that she wanted me home for Thanksgiving, that she wanted her family to be together, like we should be, and that she'd be very happy if I would come. Can you believe that? She runs so hot and cold, it's no wonder I'm all fucked up half the time.", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to accept her invitation?"}, {"instruction": "I told her I'd think about it as long as she promised me she wouldn't give me any shit, and she said she wouldn't. I told her I'd let her know in the morning. I think I'll probably go--I don't have anywhere else to go, and I really missed little Aaron and my...uh, Mark. I've missed them both a lot.", "input": "", "output": "I hope it goes well for you, Alex. I hope your Thanksgiving will turn out to be a happy one."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Me too, dude. Well, I should be going now. I've got to call Katherine. Happy Thanksgiving, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Happy Thanksgiving, Alex. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Okay, later.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. How are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess. I'm all right. It seems like a long time since I saw you last.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Mainly because so many things have came down since last week. Thanksgiving was so unpredictable and with a couple of twisted surprises. I talked to Katherine and worked things out with her. The shit with Benny has taken an interesting turn--so much stuff. Oh, and then there's Luke. Remind me to tell you about him, okay? But mostly, I've been spending a lot of time alone, thinking and trying to figure out who I am and stuff like that.", "input": "", "output": "Any conclusions?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing much, really. Since Benny left my life last year, everything inside me kind of died and nothing had any meaning anymore. I felt lost, like I was drifting aimlessly. I think about things that happened since then--moving in with Ralph, meeting Katherine and Jake, the art fiasco, Cami and Regina, Luke, and then Ted the Benny's look-alike--all that stuff just proves to me that I didn't take the time to figure out who I was. I was just drifting in this huge, stormy sea.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I have this picture in my mind of some ideal, of the way things should be, or rather, of how I want things to be. One of the things I realized was that my self-esteem just sort of crumbled when Benny dumped me, I felt very unworthy inside. I'm amazed that I found someone like Luke when I did. I was never really ready for him, for a real relationship, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Tell me more about your ideal picture of life."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't really know where to start. Let me see. I want to understand things completely, and I want to be understood. I feel like there's this huge void in me, and it goes way back, even before Benny was a part of my life. It's like I yearn so much to be accepted and loved by my...uh, my mother, as stupid as that sounds.", "input": "", "output": "It's not stupid, Alex. We all want to be accepted by our family and friends."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but we don't all get that, do we? Sometimes, I think she'll never be like that. Never! But then, when I least expect it, this big surprise would happen.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "You know, the only time I've ever felt loved, really loved, was when my grandmother was still alive. She took time with me. She talked to me and listened to me, and she taught me things. I think most of what I know now I learned from her. She scolded me when I did bad things, but she never treated me like I was too much trouble for her. I have this image in my head of her as a hero. She died so long ago. There aren't many heroes around these days, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What makes someone a hero?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. How do I put this? A hero to me is someone I admire and look up to. It's a person who does great things, things that make me want to be like them. Benny was my hero for a while. Now it seems like Katherine is my hero.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I guess, someday, she may be replaced with another hero. But I can't even imagine that right now.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it's true, Alex, as you grow and change, so will the heroes in your life."}, {"instruction": "I guess. I try to learn what I can from a person. And when I'm done, I move on to the next lesson, the next person. I guess what's important about having heroes is the fact that they inspire us to emulate the things we admire in them the most. I think about the reasons I like Katherine so much. Mainly, it's because of the way she is--she's so easy going about life. She's what I hope to become one day--successful, and generous with people, and patient. Patience is the most important thing. That's definitely something my mother isn't. I've got to tell you what she did...she can be such a bitch. Last week, after I left here, I went over to Katherine's house and...well, she wasn't there. This is getting a little off the subject, but I'll get back to my mother in a minute. Anyway, I decided to wait for Katherine to get home, only I didn't know that she had gone away for Thanksgiving. So I was sitting there on the porch, waiting and waiting, when the police pulled up. One of her neighbors saw me and called them, thinking I was doing something suspicious, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, it was not as bad as it sounds. One of the cops recognized me. That felt great--I was being recognized by the police, real great! So they asked me what I was doing there and stuff like that. And I just told them the truth--I was waiting for Katherine, my friend, to get home. They told me someone thought I was trouble. Well, that is the story of my life. So this person called them out there, and the police came along and told me to go home. So I went back to Luke's condo and paged Katherine. Finally, she called me back and told me she was with her family for the holiday. She was pissed at me for leaving the way I did. She said I should have talked to her instead of just leaving like I did. I told her she was right.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "She told me how worried she was and how, as friends, we could have talked it out rather than approach the problem the drastic way that I did. And then she said what you and everyone else say: \"I wish you'd stop and think before you acted.\" God, how many times do I have to hear that before it sinks in? Everything she said to me...she was totally right, and I told her so. Eventually, after some heavy sighs and stuff, things calmed down, and everything was cool between us again. But during our talk, Katherine told me what my mother did.", "input": "", "output": "What did your mother do?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, can you just imagine? The night I left Katherine's, my mother called for me and was told I wasn't there. The next morning, she called again, and Katherine told her that she didn't know where I was, that I moved out. Well, my mother thought Katherine was lying to her or something because that afternoon, my mother paid Katherine a little visit in her office at SII. Katherine said that she arrived pissed as hell and poised for a fight.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Typical. She accused Katherine of all kinds of stuff. She called her a liar and wanted to know what business Katherine had keeping a sixteen-year-old boy at her house--my mother was implying that we were having sex or something. But sixteen? My stupid mother doesn't even know how old I am! Katherine told her that I was seventeen. And she also told my mother that her accusations were totally ridiculous. It took a few tellings for that to sink in. Well, Katherine said that my mother slammed the door closed as she stormed out of Katherine's office. And then she turned around and went right back in the office--I could just picture the whole thing, it is so like my mother to cause a scene. She warned Katherine that if she was lying, she would find out the truth and there would be hell to pay. And then Katherine firmly but quietly said, \"Larraine, get the hell out of my office. You have no right to be doing this.\" And my mom just left, of course she slammed the door again as she walked out. Katherine wasn't going to play my mom's high-school girl games, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, leave it to my mother to create such a ruckus. Well, I apologized to Katherine, and not only for what my mother did but for the way I left, making her worry like that. That was so unfair. Katherine accepted my apology and promised she would still help me in any way she could. She even offered to help me find a more permanent place to stay, but I told her that I was okay where I am at the moment. I'll probably see her in the next few days. This thing with my mother really boiled my blood, but I was determined not to let it get the best of me, like normally.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. So what happened on Thanksgiving?"}, {"instruction": "This is the best part. I went over to my mother's house, like I planned on. I saw Mark and got to spend some time playing with little Aaron, that was fun. He's so cute and such a happy little baby. I wonder how long it will take for my mother to fuck him up?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So anyway, Luke came home from the East Coast, early Thanksgiving morning. His father was away, and his sister was in Southern California, so he came along with me to my mother's. Ralph was there, too, and so was my cousin Rosemarie. There was also this guy, this glam-queen. He was all made up with mascara, and dark blue hair, and a ruffled shirt. It was too much. So this guy is yet another of my family's secrets--he's Rosemarie's son, Ethan. He came from New York to be with us, but I didn't know anything about him. I saw the family resemblance right away. It turns out that he's only six months older than me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I guess the Oscar Wilde gene runs in my family--I tell you this guy...well, you should have seen him. I was all, \"Girl, you need to get over yourself!\" Luke said there's a lot of people in New York who look like that. I was half expecting him to stand up and start singing Ziggy Stardust. Okay, so let me get to the point...Ethan has nothing to do with it by the way. I've only told you about him because...well, because there's something else there with him, something they still haven't told me.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when I asked him where his father was, Rosemarie practically choked on her food, and my mother kicked Mark under the table. Not much gets past me in that house, I always have to be on my toes there anyway. Well, my mother turned pale. But Ethan said that he never knew his father and didn't even think about him--it didn't really matter to him, as if I'm supposed to believe that. But there was more to it, that's for sure. I just haven't figured it out yet. Anyway, after dinner, I did the dishes, while my mom and the girls cleared the table. My mom was actually nice to me, but then she had no idea that I knew about the thing with Katherine.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Well, my mom is only nice when she's trying to hide something or get something from you. And in this case, she was hiding this thing with Katherine. When the girls were out of the kitchen, I stopped my mom and told her quietly that I didn't appreciate her taking her bad mood out on Katherine, that it was not cool.", "input": "", "output": "And how did she respond?"}, {"instruction": "She hesitated for a minute--I think she was thinking of some excuse--but then she just said, \"You're right, Alex.\" I was all, \"Huh? Okay, who are you? And what have you done with my mother?\" Don't laugh, that's really how it went down! We both just stayed calm and didn't fight. She said, \"Look, Alex, I'm trying here, okay? I'm really trying to get along with you and understand you. You've got to give me some credit for that.\" I had to grab the counter to keep my knees from buckling, you know? Where in hell did that come from all of a sudden? So I said, \"Okay, if you really want to try this time and get along, then I need you to go to Katherine and apologize for how you treated her. And, tell her it will never happen again.\"", "input": "", "output": "Well, Alex..."}, {"instruction": "I sort of surprised myself, too. She agreed to speak to Katherine first thing next week. I asked her why she had acted the way she did in the first place.  And my mother said that she wanted to talk to me and thought that Katherine was covering for me, trying to keep us apart. I told my mother that Katherine wouldn't do something like that, that she's an honest person. And I told my mother that if she just gave people a chance before she jumped on them, then...well...uh, that's when I saw myself in her eyes.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "She and I are just alike. We're just a couple of hotheads, you know? I just laughed out loud, right there. And do you know what? My mom got it, too! We both were laughing our heads off, right there in the kitchen. Mark walked in on us, and the look on his face was priceless. He was so totally relieved. At least we came to some understanding, for once. And it was too cool. I think my mom and I reached an important point in our relationship.", "input": "", "output": "Really? Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I think Katherine is rubbing off on me. Yeah, something like that. But wait, there's more! Here's the very best part. I saved it for last. While we were all sitting around the table, eating dessert, the telephone rang. And guess who it was?", "input": "", "output": "Who?"}, {"instruction": "Cecil! It was Cecil. He called to tell us that the police arrested someone for Benny's assault! I was wondering how long it would take them to find the guy. Cecil said that they will have the guy's arraignment hearing early this week. And Cecil will see the judge to ask about dropping the charges against me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know the person who is being charged with Benny's assault?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know that much yet. Cecil doesn't know either, but we'll find out, and I can't wait. I don't have any idea who it could be or where the hell he came from. I only know that they got him, and that's all that matters to me right now. I feel so...uh, so vindicated, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad, Alex. Things turned out pretty well."}, {"instruction": "I'll say! I had a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving, more than I ever could have imagined, way more! And I owe it all to you, dude.", "input": "", "output": "Me? How is that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, if you hadn't kept after me--the way you do about my temper and my habit of acting before thinking--then I don't think I would have handled this the way I did. I could have just attacked my mother at the Thanksgiving dinner, but I thought about it first and thought better of it.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Alex, I'm glad you handled yourself so well and exercised judgment and restraint even under provocation. I am very proud of you for that. You should be proud, too."}, {"instruction": "It's great, isn't it? Wow! Look at the time, we went way over this time. I've got to go back to Luke's and take him to the airport.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't tell me about Luke."}, {"instruction": "It's okay, that will wait. A little suspense won't hurt you! I'm out of here, dude!", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Alex, I'll see you next week. Take care of yourself."}, {"instruction": "I'm doing pretty good, man, pretty good. This has been a good time for me, actually.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Remember I told you they arrested someone for assaulting Benny? I know who it was now. Brent Woodson.", "input": "", "output": "Who is he?"}, {"instruction": "He's the father of the kid Benny molested--the one they arrested Benny for molesting in the first place.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Pretty weird, uh? According to Cecil, the guy had been harassing Benny ever since he came home from jail. He phoned and threatened him, and they had a little run-in one day at the Safeway store over on Market Street. I remember the guy, too.", "input": "", "output": "You know him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I never actually knew him, I just knew who he was. He sat there in court every day of Benny's trial, and he always had this mad, frightening look on his face. It was like he was ready to kill or something. It was kind of scary, really. He was pretty obvious about it, sighing out loud sometimes at certain points in the trial. I know other people noticed him, too. He wasn't disruptive, but he got noticed because of the way he acted. I remember Cecil pointed him out to me one day. And once, after I knew who he was, he made eye contact with me. But he didn't look at me in a weird way, he just looked into my eyes and held me there for a minute or so. I remember that. So I guess he was following Benny around, waiting for the right moment to strike. And...well, you know the rest. The fact that I was there too was totally convenient timing for him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, Benny is home from the hospital.", "input": "", "output": "He is?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and it's with less than a full load, too, at least that's what Ralph said. I didn't go and check. Not that the thought didn't cross my mind, but I knew I couldn't go there. I just can't.", "input": "", "output": "I think that's a wise decision."}, {"instruction": "Oh, do you think I don't know that? He affects me like alcohol affects an alcoholic; I think I've said that before. It's pretty scary what he does to me, you know? He's left a wide path of destruction behind him. And now he's been hurt so bad and has a room temperature IQ--I'm sure--so payback's a mother fucker, you know? It's hard to believe the guy beat out a million other sperm, if you think about it. Okay, that's enough of trashing Benny, because I could go on...", "input": "", "output": "Don't."}, {"instruction": "Thank you!", "input": "", "output": "Have the charges against you been dropped?"}, {"instruction": "Well...uh, no, they didn't do that. Cecil went to court the day they held the guy's hearing, but they didn't do things the way I thought they would. Cecil only got to sit and watch, just like everybody else. But he did get them to schedule another hearing in light of this new arrest and the evidence that came with all that. Apparently, the guy confessed; he told them he wanted Benny dead. I was all, \"Who doesn't?\" My hearing will be held soon. I can't remember the date--this month I'm a little screwed up with my dates. This year has gone by so fast! The hearing will be in a week or so. Cecil is pretty confident they will drop the charges against me, but I'm more skeptical.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, things just don't work out for me that way. I don't know. It's just...it's...uh, it's just that I got this feeling going on down there, in my gut. It's some sort of instinctual thing. But it's just a feeling. We'll see. Uh, we need to change the subject or something. So, what else is going on? Oh! I had a nice conversation with Katherine last Monday night.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "She called me the moment she got home from work. She wanted to know what was up with my mom.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Over Thanksgiving, I told my mom I wanted her to apologize to Katherine, remember? Well, she did. First thing Monday morning, my mom was waiting at Katherine's office. Katherine told me that when she saw my mother, she thought, \"Oh shit, here we go again!\" And of course it was for a good reason, too--we both know how my mother can be. Imagine if my mom was waiting for you first thing on a Monday morning. Scary, huh? It's hard for her to open her mouth without sticking at least one foot in it and then trying to make it seem as if it was all your fault. But she did it! Just as I asked her to, she apologized to Katherine.", "input": "", "output": "Are you surprised?"}, {"instruction": "Aren't you? Katherine said my mom asked for her forgiveness and promised she would try not to let something like that happen again. Katherine said she accepted her apology and then shooed her out of her office fast. Katherine said that all the while she was wondering what dirty little trick my mother had up her sleeve. I was all, \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\" But I didn't tell Katherine that I told my mom to do that, I just let her think she did it on her own.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So my mom did it, can you believe that? She didn't call me herself to say she did it, she wanted Katherine to tell me, I guess. It's funny, I knew she would do it when she said she would--I could see it in her eyes. I could see that for once her light was on and there was actually someone home. For once, she was being a real person and not someone who just walks away from their own mistakes and pain. I realize that when you run from the hard stuff, you just cut off all your possibilities to learn and grow from it.", "input": "", "output": "That's an interesting way of seeing it."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's not like she or I...uh...well, we've never given each other a chance to get to know one another. We were quick to fight and to disagree. That's where my mom and I are alike, I think, unfortunately. But we have to stay in the communication mode in order for anything positive to have a chance to come out of all of this, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "Definitely. As long as you and your mother are willing to work on it,  in time, you might be able to develop trust, love, and friendship. But keep in mind that you are both \"hot heads,\" as you put it. Don't be too quick to judge her. Nobody is perfect."}, {"instruction": "Perfect as a smile.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "They're both a lie, usually.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I know you're apprehensive when it comes to your mother, but remember she's probably apprehensive, too. It's hard to start a relationship with a grown son."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. You know I've always asked myself if there was something wrong with me or if it was her. It's pretty scary when you think it's always your own fault and you don't even know why things happened the way they did.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I've always wondered that about myself--was it all my fault? I still do--about everything, not just her. The other night, I went over to Tony's, and we had a pretty good time. We talked for a while. I had biked over there and was wearing my winter riding clothes: tight black pants and a bright yellow long sleeve shirt. It's been so cold lately. But anyway, as I was getting ready to leave, Tony just started groping me, as if I was going to go for that or something! As if! Then he grabbed me and hugged me tight, and he wouldn't let go. I was all...uh, it was too...it was weird. It was real creepy. And I told him not to do it, to let me go. I told him twice that it was not cool. I was all, \"What part of 'no' don't you understand?\" That wasn't the first time he did something like, either. The way he pushes himself on me...it really creeps me out. Totally! At first, I was wondering if it was something I did: was it my clothes? Was it something I said? I thought it was my fault. My fault! It took me a while to see that he has this...uh, this personal space issue or something. He doesn't understand what violation means. Tony doesn't respect me or my personal space.", "input": "", "output": "So you no longer believe that you're to blame for Tony's advances?"}, {"instruction": "I know that now. But...well, it made me feel bad because he just doesn't get out with other people enough.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "Wait, let me take that back and say it differently. He just doesn't get out enough with normal people. He's always hanging out with the freaks, and drag-queens, and other scary monsters. And they're all...well, they're not...uh, never mind.", "input": "", "output": "You have to make sure he knows how you feel."}, {"instruction": "Hello? I told him no two times already, and he still made these little advances on me. I don't know what's up with him. Why does he have to be like that? I told him it was so not cool. He finally backed away and then acted like this shamed puppy the rest of the night. One minute, he's aggressive, and the next, he's ridiculously passive. It's sickening! It makes me want to slap him...but he'd actually enjoy that. So what can I do except be mean to him and continue to tell him no?", "input": "", "output": "Telling Tony that you don't want him to make physical advances on you is not being mean. It's just telling him like it is. You can say it calmly, without malice. You can tell him that he shouldn't be offended--you're not rejecting his friendship, just his sexual interest in you. Always remember that you have the right to say no, Alex, anytime and in any situation."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess, but...", "input": "", "output": "But what? Everyone has that right, Alex. Tony knows that."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Okay. I still don't know what I'm going to do about it, or if I'm going to do anything about it at all. I can always avoid him. I can make it so that I'm never alone with him--that's when he tries to get this creepy affection thing going. Or I can just go on as if nothing had happened...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I think it might be a good idea to try not to be alone with Tony for awhile."}, {"instruction": "What bugs me most is that he knows my trip. He knows where I've been and how it's all affected me. He knows! But he still does these pseudo-sexual antics with me, knowing how really bugged I get and how it creeps me out. I'm almost at the point where I may just bag on him if he does it again, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "I don't have any other option. Luke says I can't go to Tony's alone anymore. He was pissed when I e-mailed him about what happened between Tony and me.", "input": "", "output": "I would like to talk about Luke, if you don't mind. Your relationship with him is improving?"}, {"instruction": "Have you been thinking about this all week, since I mentioned it last time?", "input": "", "output": "He is an important person in your life..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, right. Well, we've been keeping in touch by e-mail, massaging each other a lot. He's coming back to San Francisco after the first of the year. He wants me back.", "input": "", "output": "He does? How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "Ha! You are too funny, Doc. Yes, he does want me! But I don't know about it. We slept together in the same bed while he was here, but we didn't...uh, we didn't do anything. We just slept and kind of cuddled. He was thrilled to have me so close again, he could hardly contain himself, if you know what I mean. Well, I was kind of excited, too...secretly.", "input": "", "output": "Secretly?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah, secretly. I didn't get naked with him or anything like that. It would have been easy to go there with him. But I knew it wasn't the right way to begin again, if that's what we are going to do. I still need some time to figure things out, to figure myself out. For all I know, I could be in jail in a few months! So I really need to keep on figuring all of this out. And that's what I've told him. In the meantime, I'm staying at his place, and I'm okay alone for now. When he comes back, I may have to go someplace else, maybe back to Ralph's. Or I may just stay there. I don't know yet, but it's good to have a choice. I told Luke that I don't want him to come back if his only reason for doing so is his desire to get back together with me. He needs to have other reasons, too.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And what did Luke say to that?"}, {"instruction": "He said that his main reason is that he just can't be away from the West Coast for very long and winter back East isn't pretty. Plus, he said he only went away because he was pissed at me. And that is a totally wrong reason to go all the way to New York. Plus, his sister is here, and his father's house is here, if not his father. Luke is homesick.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you've been putting so much thought into your relationship with Luke. That is very good. I'm proud of you, Alex. You need to give yourself a pat on the back."}, {"instruction": "I haven't been figuring all this out on my own. Katherine and I had a very good talk the other night. She really helps me to see things right, you know? She is the only other person, besides you, that I can talk to like this. And she knows what to say and how to say it. The woman is a goddess, I'm telling you. She's a good friend.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, Doc, I guess this is it for today.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, we are out of time. Alex, I'll be going out of town for a few weeks..."}, {"instruction": "How few?", "input": "", "output": "I won't be back until February."}, {"instruction": "I see. That's more than just a few weeks, hmm?", "input": "", "output": "It's a fairly long time. Doctor Whitestone will be covering for me while I'm gone. She's very nice, you'll like..."}, {"instruction": "When are you leaving?", "input": "", "output": "After next week."}, {"instruction": "That's a hell of a short notice, don't you think? How long were you planning on keeping me in the dark about this?", "input": "", "output": "Last week didn't seem like the right time..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...well, I've got to go.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I'm sorry about this, but I need to spend some time with my father. And you can always get in touch with me if you need to. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "All right. I'll see you next week, Alex. Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Alex. How..."}, {"instruction": "You don't have to be so nice, you know, especially since you're leaving for such a long time. You did this last year, and I was thinking that things were going to be different this year, but...well, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "What's wrong, Alex? Last week, you seemed fine about this."}, {"instruction": "Well, that was last week, dude! This week, I'm not so sure. I didn't have time to think about it when you first told me. But now...well, now I've turned it over and over in my head for a week, along with everything else that's been on my mind. It's frustrating!", "input": "", "output": "What's frustrating?"}, {"instruction": "This obsessive-compulsive thing I'm doing lately. I hate it.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by turning things over in your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's one of the ways that I get obsessive. The other ways in which I obsess are with my bicycle riding and with my baking.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Well, while I ride my bike, I catch myself counting each time I pump the pedals. That's kind of weird, I think. I usually lose track, though, when I get into the high hundreds. The other thing I just realized I do is bake in extraordinarily excessive amounts. This past weekend, I baked eighteen dozen cinnamon rolls for the Alliance Art and Bake Sale--way more than they asked me for. Plus, I baked twelve dozen chocolate chip cookies. I made a bunch of truffles and...oh, baked a bunch of other kinds of cookies, too. I'm so prolific in the kitchen lately, I make Martha Stewart look lazy! Oh, that reminds me. Here's a pack of truffles for you. Merry Christmas!", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Alex. They look wonderful."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, each time you bite into one, you're going to think of me, and how you left me here like this, and how pissed I am about it.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "You were the one who said you were going to stand by me and help me see all this through. Now what am I going to do?", "input": "", "output": "Alex, I am standing by you. I'm not leaving forever; it's not that long really. You can go and see Doctor Whitestone in the meantime. She's very nice. I was very careful in picking my substitute. It will be all right, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...", "input": "", "output": "Where do you find the time for all this baking? It sounds like it takes both a lot of work and time to do all that you've described."}, {"instruction": "I just make the time, I guess. It's easy for me. Luke has this great kitchen with lots of counter space and a double oven. I used his bread machine to make the dough for the cinnamon rolls, and the rest was super easy. Katherine came by and helped me load everything into the car, and we drove over to the Alliance on Saturday. I noticed that something is still up with her. She won't say what, but something is definitely going on. She says nothing is wrong, but...well, I don't know. I just can tell there's something. I even had this dream where she was crying and nothing I could say or do would make her stop. I remember something she said in the dream: \"It's never easy, no matter what they say.\" That sort of stuck with me for some reason. I don't know why, but I guess it's true.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, let me fill you in on what happened since last week, and you'll see why. We had the preliminary hearing with that weird judge. As soon as I saw him, I thought, \"Oh, great!\"", "input": "", "output": "Why? Who is he?"}, {"instruction": "You haven't heard of the guy they call the Style Counsel?", "input": "", "output": "No."}, {"instruction": "He's obsessed with what clothes people wear in his court. He'll look you up and down and sometimes make a comment about your clothes. There was a feature in the Sunday paper about him recently. He's friends with Mayor Willie Brown--figures, huh? The last time I saw this judge was when I beat up that guy about two years ago. I was wearing all black, with my nose ring and my long hair. He didn't like me then. I think he said I looked \"sickly,\" which I probably did. And this time, just like the police, he recognized me! Shit! He knew me by name, instantly. He looked down his nose at me and said, \"Well, Mr. Rozzi, I see you have discovered color for your wardrobe, hmm?\" I was all, \"At least my pants don't hang halfway down my ass looking twenty sizes too big!\" Well, that didn't impress him, but I think I saw a hint of a smile on his face after I said that. Anyway, he's a tough judge. And he decided there is enough evidence against me to hold a trial.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I see."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, they're charging me with an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Cecil was surprised when the judge said it, I could see that much. Later, Cecil said that the judge was going to make an example of me for being through his court before. He told me to keep my mouth shut from now on.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like a very good advice."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Cecil tried to argue my defense--that I only acted after I was abducted and assaulted myself--but it didn't matter. That damn judge has it in for me. Benny was the one who violated the restraining order first by finding me that night. Cecil somehow managed to find two people who saw Benny blocking the sidewalk in front of me when we had our little exchange. Yet Cecil thinks that these witnesses could go either way--they could either help or hurt us. I'm just not sure what he meant by that.", "input": "", "output": "You should ask him. The more you know about your situation and the more you understand, the better off you are."}, {"instruction": "So, it was kind of a surprise to me that they're going to have a trial when everything was so clear to me. I wasn't the one who hurt him. I just terrorized him a bit. On tape. But I didn't do anything other than that. That tape is what did me in. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be in so much mess now. The only good thing is that Cecil went to the DA and plea-bargained my charge down from a felony to a misdemeanor assault, which is better for me, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to take it?"}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to take the plea bargain?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "Well, my understanding is that the charge is reduced to a misdemeanor only if you plead guilty.  If you insist on a trial, they'll try you on the felony charge."}, {"instruction": "Well, that's important--leave it to you to point out the obvious.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "The big question is whether I'll get convicted--it's that \"if\" part. Doctor Elgin will testify on my behalf and will show all the evidence he collected for that kit-thing...the rape kit. I'm very lucky to have ran into Katherine that night. If I hadn't seen her then, I would never had gone to a doctor at all. Hell, I wouldn't have even thought about it. Since that night, I've been running like a crazy person--there's so many things to do. And I constantly feel like I have no time to do anything. One minute, I'm happy--I'm happy about the good things in my life, about Luke and Katherine, about Ralph getting better, about all those things that I make me happy. Then, with no warning, I'm on the floor with my head in my hands, down on my knees, crying like a baby. Everything is so confusing. And to top of it all, you're going away!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex. Doctor Whitestone..."}, {"instruction": "Save it, Doc! I'm not talking to someone else, okay? No way! I'll be fine, really I will. It's okay. Just go and don't worry about me. I'll get through it.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "What? All right, I'm sorry. It's just that...well, it's kind of a shock to me that you're really going away. And in case you haven't noticed, I'm kind of having a rough time here lately, okay?", "input": "", "output": "I know you are, Alex. But I'll come back. I promise."}, {"instruction": "Well, let's not talk about this anymore, okay? The other thing I'm obsessing about is Luke. He's decided to come back earlier than I originally thought.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "I'm going around and around, wondering what I should do. He and I never lived together before, and I was just getting used to being alone at his place. It's not a small place, but it's not big either...well, compared to what I'm used to, that is. I've never lived in a house with less than four bedrooms before. Ralph has four. My mom has five. And Katherine has five, or maybe there's more than that, I can't remember. And now I'm alone in a one-bedroom place, and it's okay. But when Luke gets back, it will be cramped. Plus, I don't even know what he's going to expect from me. And right now, as we speak, he is packing his car and a trailer with his stuff, and he's going to drive back and be here in time for Christmas. I think he's overly-excited, and he's going to come back expecting a lot. And I'm just not sure I can give him a lot, at least right now. Do you see what I mean by things being not so easy?", "input": "", "output": "You should have a conversation with Luke before he arrives. Tell him what you just told me--life is very difficult for you right now, and it's hard for you to make emotional commitments..."}, {"instruction": "I've told him that, but we're talking about Luke--when he puts his mind to something, he does it. I know I'm trying to predict the future here, but it's not so good. I know I can go back to Ralph's, but I just don't know right now. Oh, did I tell you what my mother did?", "input": "", "output": "No. What did she do?"}, {"instruction": "It's not a bad thing, actually, surprisingly. She sent Katherine a huge, fancy gift basket from Macy's, with a bunch of teas, hot chocolate, and all kinds of stuff. My mother put a card, saying \"Happy Holidays.\" And then she wrote a small note to Katherine, saying something like, \"Thank you for graciously accepting my apology and for being such a good friend to Alex.\" I was all, \"Check all the packages to make sure nothing's been tampered with!\" Katherine just laughed; she thought it surprising that my mother went to such expense and trouble to show her appreciation. I'm still not sure what this is about, though.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "This thing going on with her...it's so surreal. My mother is being nice. Larraine? Nice? So unreal! Is she dying or what? Maybe I should ask her.", "input": "", "output": "I understand your apprehension. You have good reasons. But try to give her a chance, see what develops."}, {"instruction": "Well, she hasn't really given me any reason to trust her yet. It's just that this is too bizarre. Why is she being nice all of a sudden? I still don't trust her. She can easily go off at any moment, she's such a psycho-bitch! Katherine is even wondering what she's up to, you know? Plus, you should see her. She's been dressing up real nice, not tacky but nice. She's wearing Christmas colors and smiling a lot. She even gave presents to everyone. I don't know, it makes me wonder. My cousin Ethan said to me the other day, \"Your mom is so cool.\" I wanted to punch him for that, but I just looked at him with little daggers in my eyes...little does he know. I've told you about Ethan, right?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you've mentioned him."}, {"instruction": "Well, I've become his official tour guide. I just wish I could get him to lose the blue hair and mascara. He's escaping from something in New York, that's why he's here.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you think that?"}, {"instruction": "It's just a feeling. He probably got into some sort of trouble back home and came here to escape. He told me that when I asked him about his father I touched a nerve. He said he doesn't want Rosemarie to know that he had been trying to figure out who his father is because she won't tell him herself. I think now I'm beginning to see what's between my mom and her--they're too much alike. But Ethan plays his mother a little differently than I have. He just pretends that it doesn't really matter, and somehow he usually gets his way. I knew that something was up with that, I just knew it! So I got Ethan involved with the Alliance, and he's helping with the name tags for the big fund-raiser-dinner-party-dance-thing they're having this weekend. He knows calligraphy. Are you going to the fund-raiser?", "input": "", "output": "No.  I got an invitation, but I'll be out of town then."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's pretty expensive from what I've heard. Katherine is involved with it, and they're having it at the Marriott downtown. It's something like two hundred dollars a plate. I can't even imagine.", "input": "", "output": "That's a lot of money."}, {"instruction": "Well, that will be the day. So I guess I've told you all the things I'm obsessing about. I don't know what to do about them. A lot of it is out of my hands anyway. The trial begins soon. It's going to happen while you're gone. Christmas is going to happen while you're away, too. You sure picked a screwed time to go.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you'll be fine. Just remember to seek out the support you need from the people who care about. Katherine is there for you."}, {"instruction": "She's busy.", "input": "", "output": "And there's Ralph."}, {"instruction": "He's busy, too.", "input": "", "output": "And it sounds like you have a new friend in Ethan."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you're reaching, dude.", "input": "", "output": "And things are going fairly well with your mother..."}, {"instruction": "Don't even go there! Dude, sometimes I can't tell if you are joking or not!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, there may be many things in your life that seem unsure or doubtful right now. But I know you have this natural faith in yourself, and it's that faith that will keep you going. In your darkest moments of doubt or fear, your faith in yourself will pull you through. You'll be fine. And the time will go by in a flash..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, for you, maybe. Well, I guess I should head out now.", "input": "", "output": "Alex, happy holidays and please, take care of yourself."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, dude. Uh, you too.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you when I return. Here's Doctor Whitestone's card."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, but I've already told you that I'm not talking to anyone else. So you can save your card for the next person.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, but if you find that you need her, my answering service can easily..."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, later, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex. I'll see you soon."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. I'm fine, I guess. But people are still crazy from that full moon we had last week. You'd think that it would be easy to see me on my bike in this bright jacket, but no! I nearly got killed out there just now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I've always thought that riding a bike in San Francisco would be quite a challenge..."}, {"instruction": "That's putting it mildly, dude! You could probably play Russian Roulette with a full cartridge with better odds. Jeez!", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you made it here okay. So tell me, Alex, what's been going on since we last met?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know where to start--so much has happened. It seems like a long time since I saw you, and at the same time, it feels like no time has passed. It's weird. Well, let's see...oh, I'm free at last!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "I'm free! I turned eighteen two weeks ago. And I got a GED--no more school!", "input": "", "output": "Well, happy birthday, Alex, and congratulations. I didn't know you chose to get a GED."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, it happened somewhere back there, during the holidays. I called at the last minute. The test was the next day. I had no time to look over the materials or study at all. I just kind of jumped into it. But I passed, no problem. It was too easy. Oh yeah, I got my driver's license, too!", "input": "", "output": "Really? Well, you've orchestrated some big changes in your life while I was away."}, {"instruction": "This is nothing. There's so much more, dude, believe me. So much more.", "input": "", "output": "Well?"}, {"instruction": "I'm trying to decide what to tell you next. I'm back at Ralph's. He's not doing so good these days.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Do you mean why am I back at his house?", "input": "", "output": "Well, yes, that too, but what's going on with Ralph?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he had another surgery about three and a half weeks ago. They wanted to get the last of the tumors in his colon. But when they went in, they noticed something in the pelvic area. They did a quick biopsy on the tissue, and it turned out to be cancer. And there are so many little tumors there they can't even operate. The only choice left now is to try to control the cancer with more chemotherapy.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex, that's not good news."}, {"instruction": "Well, it really surprised all of us, especially Ralph, but his doctors, too. He was expecting to come out of this okay. But now...well, now, he's in a not-so-good mood these days. He's really down, and I can't blame him. But the reason I went back to live with him wasn't because of him, it was because of Luke.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know what happened really. Luke had started his drive home from New York. I told him to go slow--he had a trailer and all that stuff--but he had to push it. Well, he got started and then got caught in a snowstorm, and had a minor car accident. All that delayed him by ten days, and he wasn't able to get home in time for Christmas. But we talked on the phone every day. I did what you told me to do--I tried to talk to him about our relationship, about what was going to happen when he got here, about me needing time to get adjusted and stuff. But he didn't listen. He just kept changing the subject, interrupting me and shit. So finally, this one day, he called and said that he wanted me out of his condo by the time he got back to the Bay Area.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that was what I wanted to know. I was all...I mean...I was just like, \"What is this about, Luke?\" But he just told me to get out, so I left. I went back to Ralph's, and he was real glad to see me. He even signed over one of his cars to me. So now, I have something to drive.", "input": "", "output": "That was generous of Ralph. Did you ever find out why Luke asked you to leave?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not directly, but I think I figured it out, maybe. He came back and called me the moment he got in. He said he needed to see me, so I went over to his place. Luke tried to act like nothing was wrong, like it was normal for him to ask me to leave. It's so like him to skirt the issues that make him uncomfortable. But at least he called, he tried. I think Luke felt rejected when I asked for some time and to take it easy when it came to our relationship. I tried telling him that I wasn't rejecting him at all--I have a lot on my plate right now, and I thought he would understand. I guess I just  expected him to understand...", "input": "", "output": "Did Luke try to understand where you were coming from?"}, {"instruction": "He asked me to move back into the condo with him. But I told him no. It was too late. Now I have Ralph to think about. He's going to die, and I need to be there for him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I don't want Ralph to know how worried I am, though. And Luke...well, he doesn't really know what he wants. And he thinks I don't know what I want, which is probably more true than I want to admit. So, for now, we're just sort of dating, I guess. We went out to dinner a few times, and to a play, and even to a few movies. Oh, last Friday night, we did Critical Mass. There were about a hundred and fifty of us on bikes, and we rode through town with some hot police escorts on motorcycles. Besides the men in uniform, my favorite part of the ride was Haight Street. There are all kinds of different people up there, it's a veritable human cornucopia or something. I just love it! At one point, a bunch of us lifted our bikes above our heads and started cheering. The people on the sidewalk were looking at us funny. The ride was very cool. I wish we could do Critical Mass every Friday night.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you don't."}, {"instruction": "Oh, did you get caught up in our bike jam?", "input": "", "output": "No, but..."}, {"instruction": "You ought to get out and get a bike yourself. Dude, you could use the exercise!", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, what are friends for? Sorry, dude, it's the truth, though. You could use some sit-ups, while we're on the subject...", "input": "", "output": "Well then, let's change the subject. What is going on with your legal troubles?"}, {"instruction": "Ouch! That hurts. My legal troubles? You make it sound so formal. Well, I told Cecil to kiss my ass--he expected me to accept that stupid plea bargain garbage he dreamt up.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yes! No way, I'm not going to do that! No fucking way! So we had another little hearing thing, and now the trial date is set for sometime in March. Oh, I should tell you about what happened with Benny and Ethan. I've told you about my cousin Ethan, didn't I?", "input": "", "output": "You have. What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, everyone told us that we look alike. So one day, Ethan was at Ralph's house, and Benny showed up out of the blue, unannounced. He thought Ethan was me. Benny told him how sorry he was. He said he didn't remember anything about that night, but he knew he must have done something real bad to make me hurt him like that.", "input": "", "output": "How did Ethan handled Benny?"}, {"instruction": "This is what I like about Ethan--he went along with it and pretended he was me. I guess Benny is pretty messed up now. He was using a cane to walk, and he was stuttering a lot apparently. I wish I could have been there to see it for myself. Ethan had Benny going, and I guess Benny left thinking Ethan was me. Ethan thought Benny was brain damaged and all. But I don't know. Anyway, Benny is one sick son-of-a-bitch, but he went away.", "input": "", "output": "Where?"}, {"instruction": "I guess Benny's mother brought him to live with her somewhere in Grass Valley. He took me there once. There was this great river to hike along, and we lay out naked in the sun...a lot of men went to cruise there. I was so surprised to find so many of us up there, so far from the city. I guess we're everywhere. Anyway, what were we talking about? Oh yeah, Benny. He went away up to the foothills--there is a hospital or something that will help him to get better. The brain damage is the result of some strokes Benny had. It's bad, I guess, but he asked for it. So I'm going to trial because I think my story should stand up to a jury. Benny instigated the whole thing, and I was only reacting to his attack. And I only terrorized him; I didn't hurt him, even though I could have. If I had agreed to that stupid plea bargain, I'd probably be in jail right now.", "input": "", "output": "So you believe your chances are better going to trial?"}, {"instruction": "Definitely! But both Cecil and my mom wanted me to accept the plea, they seemed disappointed when I refused. I guess it would have been easier that way, but I believe it's the principal of the whole thing. Speaking of my mom, she's pregnant again. I think that's why she has been so nice to me lately. This time, she's not having as difficult a time as with the last two pregnancies. She's due in June, and they are waiting until then to find out if it's a boy or a girl--they just want to be surprised.", "input": "", "output": "Congratulations, Alex. You'll be a brother once again."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. Oh, a weird thing happened just the other night. While I was riding home from the Alliance, I rode past Rosemarie's house and saw Mark come out her front door. I didn't know why Mark was there, so I stopped and said hello to him. He was kind of jumpy. I asked him what he was doing there, and he said he was talking to Rosemarie about my mom. But I didn't believe him. I don't think they are having an affair. But Mark asked me not to tell my mom I saw him there. I don't know what's up with that. Now, I'm riding my bike past Rosemarie's house more often--I want to know what Mark is up to.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I almost thought that they were having an affair, but Rosemarie has a boyfriend. So I don't know. Mark didn't expect to see me there, that's for sure. My mom's birthday is coming up soon, so maybe his lame little story has something to do with that. But I can't help but be suspicious. It's in my nature, I guess. So, what else? I've got a job!", "input": "", "output": "You did? Where?"}, {"instruction": "I ran into Jake one day, and he told me about this assistant job he thought I'd be good at. It's at another gallery he helps to run sometimes. It's located near City Hall.

This will hold me over until I start school again.", "input": "", "output": "So you're planing to go to collage?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm trying to get into the California Culinary Academy. I already turned in all my paperwork, and now I'm waiting for my letter of acceptance.", "input": "", "output": "So you want to be a chef?"}, {"instruction": "I love that place, and I think I have the touch with food. I went on a tour of the place, and it's cool. It's in the old German Embassy building on the corner of Polk and Turk, real fancy place. I can't wait to begin. The money Aunt Sofie left me will pay for it, and my job at the gallery will help, too, if I can work it out with the class schedule and all.", "input": "", "output": "Good for you, Alex. I'm glad you're thinking of the future. I hear it's quite an education at that school."}, {"instruction": "Well, I can handle that. So I guess we're running late again.", "input": "", "output": "We are. It was good to catch up, Alex. I'm happy things are going so well for you."}, {"instruction": "Me too, it's about time. Now, all we need to do is get on with this stupid trial thing, and then everything will be all right. Well, I guess I'll see you next week?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, same time. Good to see you, Alex. Take care."}, {"instruction": "Later, dude!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Oh hello, Alex. You're a little early today."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I am, uh? I didn't expect that, but I guess I got a little ahead of myself. I went to the airport to pick-up some stuff for Chase-Thorne, and the traffic was pretty okay today.", "input": "", "output": "Who is Chase-Thorne?"}, {"instruction": "That's the gallery I'm working for. Chase-Thorne Galleries, that's their name. Have you been to any of their places? They have three different galleries here in The City, one in Sausalito, another in Napa, and one in Monterey, too. The one I work for is over on Hayes Street, practically around the corner from City Hall. We specialize in modern sculpture. It's kind of cool, actually.", "input": "", "output": "I've never been there. I'm not really into modern sculpture."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's the place where my mom's wedding gift came from--the huge sculpture that SII's big boss gave my mom and Mark. We have some huge pieces there, and some are much larger than that monster my mom got.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you enjoy working there?"}, {"instruction": "I do. Really. A lot. Way a lot! It's pretty cool. I get to meet some interesting characters, that's for sure. The people that work there are cool. We assemble these pieces right there in the gallery, and all sorts of people come in and watch us put things up and look at the work and stuff. Sometimes, the artist who made the piece is there to direct things...or to get in the way--I'm not sure which. I'm thinking about studying with this one guy who creates these electronic sculptures. They're sort of like neon light sculptures, I guess. But this week, I've been working like a mad man, running my ass off. We got back late Monday from Bonnie Doon, and you know what the weather has been like lately--what a mess we had down there!", "input": "", "output": "What were you doing in Bonnie Doon?"}, {"instruction": "Ralph dragged me down there with him on Saturday. We were only going to stay for the night. But when we got there, it wasn't a moment too soon. After that huge rainstorm we got last week, something gave and the basement floor was covered in mud. It was a huge mess, but it was confined to a rather small area. Then, the electricity went out, and we had no light that night. And the wind was howling, and the trees all around the house were whipping in the wind. It was like a horror movie or something--kind of scary! Ralph and I just lit a fire and some candles and had a nice meal together. But he kind of ruined it, though.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he started about the living trust thing again. He wants me to list everything in both houses that I want because he has a few people he wants to give some things to. But he said he wants me to have the first pick, and he doesn't want me to worry about sounding too greedy or anything. I was all, \"Ralph, this is totally too morbid.\" But he said, \"We have to talk about it.\" I told him we don't know how long he will live--the cancer might just sort of linger inside him, he might just live another twenty years or more. But he said that between the cancer and the AIDs...one way or another...well, I was completely losing my appetite by then, and I cooked a nice Italian style dinner, too.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex. I think Ralph is right. You do need to talk about it."}, {"instruction": "I cooked the whole dinner without electricity. Ralph's house has gas in the kitchen, and the water is heated by gas, too. We really lucked out there. The house is real old, built in the late 1920s, years before Ralph was born. It was built at the same time as  they built his house in the city. As a matter of fact, Ralph's father had the same people do both houses, and they used some of the same stuff: slate-rock for the floors and fireplaces, for example, and there are other similarities between the two houses, too. The house usually gets some sort of flooding each year. The mud was cleaned out by late Sunday night, but the storm was still going strong by then. Sunday morning, we went into town--if you could call it a town--and we got some sandbags and gas for the power generator. Ralph didn't stock up for Winter this year. But we managed to get the house all cleaned up and readied for more of this stormy weather. Jeez! You should have seen it--it was such a mess! You'd think that with all this damned modern technology, someone would have figured out how to control the fucking weather by now. This rain just makes me crazy! But that little trip we did...it was perfect timing.", "input": "", "output": "For what?"}, {"instruction": "To get out of the city! Last week--on Thursday night, actually--something happened that really tweaked me.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "Well, I hadn't been getting return phone calls from Luke for most of last week, and I was getting tired of always waiting, always wondering what was going to happen with him. One day, he's all loving and full of attention, and then suddenly, he's not returning phone calls or showing up. I know he's in town, and he's not working a whole lot right now. First, Luke made me believe that he wanted us to get back together. Then, he yanked the rug out from under me and told me to move out. And after we had our talk, he wanted me to move back in but I said no--mostly because he threw me out, but also because of Ralph. I didn't really expect Ralph to get worse. I was really hoping he would be better by now, but...well, I don't know. So anyway, where was I?", "input": "", "output": "You said you were tired of waiting for Luke."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's right. So I was tired of always waiting for him, you know? He has this ability to be so attentive and sweet, and then just as easily, he can be cold as ice. He's hot and cold--totally weird. Anyway, so I went over to his place to see if he was there. I knocked on the door, and a few minutes after I knocked, this guy answered the door.", "input": "", "output": "Who was he?"}, {"instruction": "That's the wrong question. It's more like, \"What was he wearing?\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "A towel. He was wearing a fucking towel! I was just stunned. And he was all real condescending like, \"Can I help you?\" I told him I wanted to see Luke. And with a nasty little smile, he said, \"He's still in the shower, but you can come in and wait for him if you'd like.\" I was like, \"No thanks!\" I started to go when he said, \"What's your name? So I can tell Luke you were here.\" I turned around and I think I snarled back, \"I'm Alex. Tell him Alex was here, and he can go and fuck off!\" And I ran down the stairs and got away from there as fast as I could. I couldn't believe my eyes! And that guy was there, with only a towel on. I was just like...I mean this was too bizarre, really. I was so mad, you know? So fucking mad.", "input": "", "output": "I can understand your anger, Alex. Did Luke made you believe you still had an exclusive relationship with him?"}, {"instruction": "Well...I mean...can you just imagine that? It was the last thing I expected to see. Luke? It's so not like him to do that. But maybe I was wrong, I don't know. All I can say now is, \"Later, Dude!\" I don't want him around me any more, no how, no way!", "input": "", "output": "So you haven't talked to Luke since?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, we talked. For about ten minutes, I listened to him try to explain to me what was going on under my nose there, but his story was totally lame. I'm not stupid, so why would he even try to treat me like I am, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What was Luke's explanation?"}, {"instruction": "What does it matter? He was playing some sort of sick game with me, that's all I can say. He doesn't even know what he wants, that's the problem. He tries to play me like a fiddle, the fucker! Oh! When I saw that guy standing there with a little towel wrapped around his waist, I saw red. It could have been raining mad dogs and razor blades that night, and it wouldn't have bothered me. I walked for probably four, maybe even five hours. It was way after three in the morning by the time I got in. Ralph was so cute. He waited up for me, or he tried to. He fell asleep there in his chair near the door with the TV on and his reading glasses still on his nose. I had to get him up to put him in bed. The next morning, we had an early major pick-up for the gallery down at the airport. Well, needless to say, I was fried-out-zombie-boy all day Friday, and I think I was mostly numb, really.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So Luke tried to tell me they had just come back from the pool. His friend came out of the shower first and so was able to answer the door while Luke was still washing up. But it didn't look that way to me.", "input": "", "output": "Is there a chance Luke could be telling the truth?"}, {"instruction": "What? What is this? Whose side are you on anyway?", "input": "", "output": "Well, could Luke have told you the truth about what happened? Could it have been an innocent misunderstanding?"}, {"instruction": "Well...uh, I don't know. No! It couldn't have been. He's lying to me. I just know he is!", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure?"}, {"instruction": "Well? You can imagine the way it looked, right? That guy looked at me and smiled. He looked satiated, if you know what I mean. He looked like he wanted me to think that he and Luke were fooling around. And I think...no, I...uh, I think maybe...I don't know, okay?", "input": "", "output": "So what are you going to do about it?"}, {"instruction": "Uh?", "input": "", "output": "What do you plan to do? Are you going to see Luke again?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know! Why does that matter to you so much anyway? I'm pissed, okay? I'm going to stay pissed as long as I need to, and then...well, I don't know. It still doesn't feel quite right to me. You know how I get those gut feelings? Well, this is one of those again. It's like...no, it would be difficult to let it go for some reason. I need to trust my gut feelings. This is sort of like that feeling I have about Mark and Rosemarie. That still bugs me. And do you know what? I asked Ethan what he knows, and he said it was a surprise to him. He claims to know nothing, but...well, he lives there, at her house. He's got to know something!", "input": "", "output": "Alex, you're very agitated, and you almost sound a little paranoid."}, {"instruction": "Paranoid? Wait! What is this anyway? First, you practically take sides with Luke, and now, you're calling me paranoid?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Alex, I didn't intend for you to get upset.  I'm just pointing out how it sounds from the outside."}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess maybe I have been a little on edge lately. So much right now is just hanging unresolved...", "input": "", "output": "I know."}, {"instruction": "It's hard for me, you know? It gets hard for me to keep my chin up with so much piled against me right now. I get kind of worried about things. Worried and irritated. Then I stay up half the night thinking about things, being haunted by stuff. And don't even talk about my bike riding--every time I get on the bike, I find myself counting out the strokes of each downward pedal.", "input": "", "output": "I think you've mentioned that once before. Have you noticed other..."}, {"instruction": "Obsessive things I do? Yeah, it's been going on for a while now. I hate it. It kills me. I don't know why I'm doing it now. It's not like I don't already have enough crap to deal with.", "input": "", "output": "And that is probably why these obsessive behaviors creep up on you. The long walks, the counting of strokes while biking, these are all ways that your subconscious mind is trying to get control over the aspects of your life that you are powerless against at the moment. The trial and Ralph's health have been very difficult on you. And your relationship with Luke has also been a cause of anxiety."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but what do I do about it?", "input": "", "output": "Well, the first step is recognizing that there's a problem. And you've done that. Some people never even notice their own compulsions. You have, and we'll work on ways to help you deal with them."}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess. We've run over time again, haven't we? I have to get the van back to the gallery before it gets too late, so I guess I'll talk to you later.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Alex. See you next week. Please remember you're always free to call me if you need my help."}, {"instruction": "Okay, thanks dude. See you!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, hi.", "input": "", "output": "What's the matter?"}, {"instruction": "What isn't the matter? It's just...well, it's just that nothing ever changes! And nothing will ever be the same. Get it?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, never mind. I'll try my best to explain what I mean without going off on a tangent, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "So we had a family meeting yesterday night, and Mark and Rosemarie are definitely not having an affair, at least not anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Were they having an affair in the past?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not any time recently. I keep thinking that Ethan and I look an awful lot alike. Everyone who saw us together said so. Even Benny mistook him for me on several occasions. But I guess it was the last thing that would have ever occurred to me, you know? It's because of Mark--we both look like him. So Mark turns out to be Ethan's father, too. Ethan is both my brother and my second cousin, simultaneously. It feels like we're on a Jerry Springer episode or something, doesn't it? Or more like I live in a trailer park, and everyone is related in one way or another.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm"}, {"instruction": "Abandonment, inter-marriages, multiple deaths, mean bitches from hell, inbreeding, you name it--we got it all at my house! Now I can start telling people I come from a long line of trailer trash and really mean it, too.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You said it, dude. \"Hmm\" is right. I was just sitting there, expecting I don't know what, when they laid it out for us. There we were, all of us: Ethan, Racyl, Rhea, Aaron, and I--Mark's spawn. We were sitting there with my mom, and Mark, and Rosemarie, and they just sort of sprang it on us. I nearly fell off my seat.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "This is so not real, you know? So not real. My father's a slut! Did he ever hear of a condom? Or how about STD's? I just asked him right out, \"So, how many other kids out there are yours?\" I know of at least six, so what's to say there aren't any more? Obviously, the guy can't keep his dick in his pants. But he said he only had the six, not to mention the one on the way.", "input": "", "output": "You only named five children just now. Were you counting the baby that's coming?"}, {"instruction": "No, I wasn't. Mark did have six, only one died. I didn't tell you about that? I thought I had. Mark had a son with Racyl and Rhea's mom up in Vancouver, but he died in a car accident.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "That's what made his wife go crazy. One day--it was her birthday, actually--Mark and his son...Jason would have been around eight or nine by now if he lived. Anyway, they were driving along a country road in Mark's truck, just the two of them, and this tractor came out of nowhere. Mark tried to swerve to avoid smashing into it and ended up rolling the truck over into a ditch. Jason was thrown from the cab and died instantly. Mark walked away from it without even a scratch. Racyl told me that's when things changed big time for them. Their mom went totally nuts, and Mark became withdrawn. That was only about four years ago. I think that's why Mark came back to us. So this really bad thing is behind our family's reunion. Mark doesn't like to talk about it.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I don't blame him for it, I guess. I can only imagine the guilt behind all that--he was the driver and all. And it happened on the kid's mother's birthday, too. I bet her birthdays are real special now! So this is something that will be with both of them for the rest of their lives.", "input": "", "output": "I imagine so, Alex."}, {"instruction": "So my father, the King of Fertility, spills his seed wherever he goes. Yesterday, when Ethan opened the door for me, he said, \"Hey, bro!\" It was not until later, I realized that he already knew the truth. And I was all, \"Fuck me!\" Now Ethan is going to start calling me \"bro\" or something. I'm so not ready for this. But now at least, I understand what is between my mom and Rosemarie. Ethan is less than a year older than me, so Mark was boinking both of them at the same time. They've got to be jealous of each other. And as far as I know, Rosemarie has never been married. Of course this explains why I ran into Mark at Rosemarie's house. But still...this is so not real!", "input": "", "output": "I can understand your surprise and conflicting feelings about all this, Alex."}, {"instruction": "That's a major understatement, dude! That was the last thing I expected.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You know, I didn't think of this until later last night, but Mark must have known that Rosemarie was pregnant when he left San Francisco. But if I remember my mom's story, she hadn't gotten a chance to tell Mark she was pregnant with me before he left. I don't know...this is all so twisted, so trashy. And suddenly, I'm feeling all proprietary over Mark or something. It's like it's important to me to be near him for some reason now. Part of me doesn't think I should trust him--he's such a dog! But then another part of me wants to just be near him, to be noticed by him, or to be his first and most important son. I didn't feel so much this way with just Racyl and Rhea. But now that Ethan is a part of that picture, I feel this sense of ownership over Mark. And now I even want to call him \"Dad.\"", "input": "", "output": "Your feelings, Alex, are very natural..."}, {"instruction": "You think so?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do. Most siblings experience a form of rivalry, vying for their parents' affection while sometimes, not even realizing that they are doing it. It's very common. I would guess that this situation is somewhat strange for Mark, too. Before he returned to the Bay Area, he thought he only had the children he fathered with his wife in Canada. Now he finds you and Ethan..."}, {"instruction": "Well, he must have known about Rosemarie being pregnant when he left, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. That depends...what's the age difference between you and Ethan?"}, {"instruction": "Two months, almost to the day. That means Rosemarie would had been two to three months pregnant when Mark left for Canada--I was conceived just before he left. Hmm. I guess it's possible that he didn't know anything about it. But I'm certain he knew a few months ago, when we had Thanksgiving dinner, because that's when I asked about Ethan's father. I distinctly remember my mom kicked Mark under the table when I asked that question. And Mark got very pale. And Rosemarie nearly choked on her food. Something was obviously up with all that, and the answer was right there in my face but I couldn't see it then. But now, I do, though. Hindsight is always twenty-twenty, isn't that what they say?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, that's the saying."}, {"instruction": "So...I don't know. I think I'm still absorbing all of this, you know? It's funny--lately, I've been watching a lot of TV with Ralph. He starts more chemotherapy next week, by the way. So we've been spending time with our butts glued to the couch and our eyes stuck to the tube, watching these shows, and I was thinking: no one goes through the kind of teen-angst I've been through, not even the goofed-up people on TV. On TV, peoples' lives are so messed up and stuff...you know Cami said to me that I live such a dramatic life that I should write a book or something--my life story would make a great movie, far better than the crap they feed us these days. I've never thought about that before. Do you think my life is full of drama?", "input": "", "output": "You've had some very difficult times, perhaps more than others your age. But I don't think it's productive to compare lives or experiences. It's not just about the events that happen, it's also important to consider how people perceive those events and how they affect them..."}, {"instruction": "Well, I do keep an irregular journal. I have put a couple of years of my life in it by now. But I don't know where I'd find the time for actually putting it into a book form or something. Oh well. So I told you that Ralph starts the chemotherapy again next week. Did you know that if the doctors thought Ralph was terminal, they wouldn't even consider doing chemo?", "input": "", "output": "That's true..."}, {"instruction": "Well, when I heard that, I felt a bunch of relief. It does make sense, doesn't it? Why waste those chemicals on someone who is going to die anyway, right? They have to make up the chemicals for chemo just before they give it to him, it's kind of like custom order poison. I guess they do that because of how expensive it is. And it can't be used later, so they can't store the stuff. It's all so complicated, really. But the point is that the doctors don't think Ralph is terminal yet. So that's a good thing, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "I'm very glad to hear it."}, {"instruction": "But I shouldn't get my hopes up, right? You don't have to say it--I can see it in your eyes. Well, I think I'm expecting the worse, but I still hope for the best. I wish I could have that attitude with everything...", "input": "", "output": "It's a good attitude..."}, {"instruction": "But it's hard to keep up. Yeah, my attitude about Luke has really changed. I think it's finally over with him.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "You know, it just occurred to me the other day that I didn't hear from him at all on Valentine's Day. I kind of expected that...well, that he would call or something, even if it was only to say hello, but he didn't. I just thought that...uh, that he would call or send a note or something, anything. I expected something from him, but I got nothing. So the next morning, after I spent the night thinking about all of this, I called Luke's number, but then I chickened out and hung up. Well, my phone rang back instantly--Luke has Caller ID, and he recognized my number.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't know what to do, really. I unplugged the phone, letting it just ring in his ear. Then a minute later, I plugged the phone back in, and hit star sixty-nine, and rang him again. But when they answered, it was some guy, not Luke. It was probably the same guy who was wrapped in a towel that day I went over there. This time, he told me Luke was in New York, finishing up the big fashion week going on out there. He said that Luke'd be home in a few days. But I keep asking myself, \"What the hell is this guy doing there anyway, answering the phone so early in the morning?\"", "input": "", "output": "Do you believe that Luke was home but this guy was covering up for him?"}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't mean that. It's just...what is up with that? Luke said that he told me he was going to New York. And he said that since we haven't been able to see each other without me getting pissed lately, he didn't think about Valentine's Day at all. And he claims this guy is just staying with him temporarily. But I'm like, \"Whatever.\" He could do whatever he wants, he does anyway, but I don't need to be a part of it. I kind of get the feeling that I'm never going to get from Luke what I need in a relationship anyway, so what's the point? With everything going so fast these days, I hardly have time for a relationship. I'm busy at the gallery all day long, and the Alliance has a lot going on right now, too. So it's all a bit much. But at least I'm staying out of trouble--that's my middle name--and I'm being productive. I don't know. Luke is slowly moving out of the picture as a possibility for me, and I think I'm okay with that. Oh my God! Is that clock right? I've got to go! I need to get the van back in the garage before they shut it down for the night. I'll see you next time, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, Alex..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, hey.", "input": "", "output": "What are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I was just looking out the window and thinking, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Well, why don't you come in and have a seat. Now, what's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "I was just thinking about what I'm going to do.", "input": "", "output": "About what?"}, {"instruction": "About my living situation, mostly.", "input": "", "output": "Are you thinking about a time when Ralph will be gone?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really. I'm thinking about right now, and I don't really want to be doing this, but...well, I think I'm going to have to...", "input": "", "output": "What you are talking about, Alex? I'm not really following you."}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure where to begin. Even though Ralph is pretty sick, he looks okay. Actually, he looks great. And for a guy his age, he looks pretty good. He's forty-seven, and from all outward appearances, you wouldn't even know he was so sick. Anyway, he said to me over the holidays, before he went into the hospital, that all he really wanted was to have sex again. He hadn't had sex for so long, and now he's worried that his surgery may leave him permanently unable to do it anymore. Sex has been on his mind for a while now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Ralph has this board thing in the kitchen that you can write messages and stuff on. So one day, I was cleaning up, and I noticed he had written on it something like: \"BB Party... at such and such time.\" That kind of freaked me out.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I think that he was going to go to a bare-backing party.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "You don't know what bare-backing is? I hear that it's become the big thing around town lately, as stupid as it sounds. Bare-backing is when you have unprotected anal sex.", "input": "", "output": "Without a condom?"}, {"instruction": "Hello? Doc, sometimes you really surprise me. Yes, without a condom! If you were blond, I'd be trying to think of a good dumb blond joke right now. Sometimes, you're about as bright as Alaska in December. But that's the idea of it--no condoms, skin to skin contact. I mean...I can't even imagine!", "input": "", "output": "That's unsafe. I've read something about that..."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, it's unsafe. That's what I'm so freaked about. Ralph doesn't need to go to some bare-backing party and pick something up. He already has it bad enough. But what if he picks up something else, some other STD? So I asked him about it, and sure enough, that's where he was going. He said everyone there is already HIV positive, so there's nothing to worry about. I was all, \"This is so not real.\" Well, nothing I've said was changing his mind; he was determined to do this.", "input": "", "output": "It's very risky, regardless of everyone's HIV status."}, {"instruction": "That's what I'm trying to say. But he won't listen to me. He went to one and came home on top of the world. He said it made him feel like it was the nineteen-seventies again: \"such freedom,\" \"no barriers,\" \"a real connection,\" \"skin to skin,\" and on and on. Well, this really freaked me out. And now I'm thinking, \"What if Ralph decides to have these parties at his house or something?\" That would just be too gross! And little did I know that it wasn't the worst thing that could happen.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "He went to another party. Then another and another. It's becoming a nightly thing. I'm totally horrified that he took to this like a drug! He completely changed. And to make matters worse, he met someone at one of the parties and brought the guy home one night. The guy hasn't left since. Needless to say, Ralph's new little boyfriend and I haven't been getting along so well. The guy tries to run everything, and I am so through with all that, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, I see your predicament."}, {"instruction": "Well, it seems I have a few big decisions to make. The gallery I work at is really expanding, and they have other retail locations. Anyway, I really seem to fit in there, and my job has sort of grown. I have more responsibilities now...", "input": "", "output": "That's good, Alex."}, {"instruction": "What I'm getting at is that they offered me a job at their Monterey gallery, and I'm seriously thinking about it. If I don't accept it, I'd still have my job at the Hayes Street location, so that's cool...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Are you surprised that they'd made me an offer like that?", "input": "", "output": "No. I'm happy for you, Alex. But are you sure you want to move?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's not like I've had much luck in my life here. This stupid weirdness with Luke makes me think I'm better off alone. So there's no love connections for me here...I've been thinking...I've decided that from now on I'm only going to date illegal immigrants!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when they threaten to break up with me, I can call INS and have the bastards deported. That way, they won't be hanging around and bothering me like some others have in past--we won't mention any names, though.", "input": "", "output": "Alex..."}, {"instruction": "I'd like to say that I can trust men, but I'd be lying. Men are pigs, dogs, jerks, you name it! It's a prerequisite to be that way, if a penis is part of the anatomy.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So what does that make you? Me?"}, {"instruction": "Well, you and I are different--we're not like the rest of them.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You know, I think all my ex's should be rounded up and put on a desert island. The island can be gated, and the ground can be electrified. I'd have the button that controls the electrical surge, and the rest would be kismet or something. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Interesting fantasy, Alex."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, I thought so, too. Actually, I think all my ex's should be strung up like a pi\u00f1ata and beaten with a stick. That'd teach them! So anyway, as far as my living arrangements are concerned, there's no easy answer. I feel like time is running out for me at Ralph's. And this time, if I leave, I'm never going back again. Luke is not having his front door open wide for my return or anything. And rent is so damned high in the city. It almost doesn't make sense to stay any more, do you know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "I can understand your reasoning. But I think Ralph does still need you, regardless of his new love interest. You're his family now. The boyfriend might just be a passing stage which won't survive the harsh realities of Ralph's illness. And what about school? Didn't you apply to the Culinary Academy? Whatever came of that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's nothing yet. I'm still waiting for them to respond to my application. I can always go to my mom's house. They have room. Wouldn't that be fun?", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't recommend that at the moment."}, {"instruction": "Well, if I went back to live there, it would guarantee my need for therapy for a long time, thereby guaranteeing a steady income for you!", "input": "", "output": "That's not the way I look at things. Alex, running away isn't going to solve anything. Your problems will follow you wherever you go."}, {"instruction": "You got it all wrong. Have you ever heard of a fresh start? And anyway, there's really no point in talking about all this right now. With the trial still looming in my not-so-distant horizon, I won't be going anywhere until it's over, and it hasn't even started yet. I may go see Katherine this weekend. I know she'll give me good advice. Cecil has asked her to be a material witness at my trial.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he thinks with someone like Katherine on the stand, it can't go too wrong. She's the kind of person that everyone likes, you know? Well, everyone except my mother, but who is responsible for that? My mother doesn't like anybody. But with Katherine up there testifying on my behalf, I think it should be pretty okay, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "I think it would be good to have Katherine as a character witness."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Cecil even mentioned something about talking to you about your testifying. Has he called you yet?", "input": "", "output": "No, he hasn't called."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Dr. Elgin is going to testify on my behalf, so that's pretty cool. I'm pretty worried about this, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I know, Alex. I'm concerned, too."}, {"instruction": "Well, the trial begins in a few weeks. I hope it will be over soon. I just wish time would speed up a little. This waiting is enough to drive a person insane, but I guess I'm in the right place for that, hmm? Have you got one of those straitjackets around here?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that will be necessary, Alex. You seem to be handling things pretty well..."}, {"instruction": "For now, maybe. I'm still catching myself counting as I pedal my bike around town, but at least I'm catching it now. With all the stupid things I've done, I just know I'm depriving a village somewhere of an idiot!", "input": "", "output": "Don't be so hard on yourself, Alex..."}, {"instruction": "I'm just kidding, dude. The only way I seem to be able to maintain my sanity is to joke a lot. We do tend to laugh a lot at work.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "We do a lot of men bashing there, too. Serena, my boss, says she's been dumped more times than the garbage dumpster out back. She says it's the main reason she's switched to women. I told her I'm thinking of switching to small farm animals myself!", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Sorry. I'm only kidding, dude. Gosh! You take everything so seriously. Loosen up, dude! So, I guess we're out of time, hmm?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I'm afraid we are, Alex. So until next time, take care of yourself."}, {"instruction": "Okay, man. Thanks, and you too!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Alex."}]
