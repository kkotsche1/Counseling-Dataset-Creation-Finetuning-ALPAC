[{"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "So, let's see. It looks that you put-- You drink alcohol at least four times a week on average-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-and you usually have three to four drinks when you do drink."}, {"instruction": "Usually three drinks and glasses of wine.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. That's at least 12 drinks a week."}, {"instruction": "Something like that.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Just so you know, my role, um, when we talk about alcohol use, is just to share information about risk and to help patients who want help. This is different than telling them what I think they should do. I don't do that."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Uh, what else can you tell me about your drinking."}, {"instruction": "Well, I usually drink when I'm at home trying to unwind and I drink while I'm watching a movie. And sometimes, um, I take a bath but I also drink when I take a bath sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, can I share with you some information on alcohol use?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, there has been a lot of research on alcohol use and the guidelines we use in this country says that having seven or more drinks per week can raise the risk of health problems for women."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Seven?", "input": "", "output": "Seven."}, {"instruction": "Wow. I knew my doctor didn't like me drinking the amount that I did but I didn't know that seven was the limit.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, you're surprised to hear that?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. What-what kind of health problems?", "input": "", "output": "Well things like heart disease, cancer, liver problems, uh, stomach pains, insomnia. Unfortunately, uh, people who drink at a risky level are more likely to be diagnosed with depression and alcohol can make depression worse or harder to treat."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Well, that's not good news.", "input": "", "output": "Well, how do you think your drinking relates to the depression you've experienced?"}, {"instruction": "Well, to be honest, I drink sometimes when I'm feeling down and I find it more interesting and not so blur.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And how do you feel after you drink?"}, {"instruction": "Well, then I feel blur again.", "input": "", "output": "So, there are some answers on this form here. Uh, less than monthly you drank more than you intended to."}, {"instruction": "Yes on occasion.", "input": "", "output": "And sometimes you feel guilty after you drink."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes I just don't like how much I drink. I sometimes finish a bottle in one night.", "input": "", "output": "So you're not proud of finishing a bottle?"}, {"instruction": "No, it's not like I get crazy or anything but I just don't like the amount that I'm drinking.", "input": "", "output": "Right. By the way, binge drinking is defined for women as having more than, uh, three drinks and there are about five drinks in a bottle. So, you enjoy drinking wine because it helps make things, uh, a little bit more interesting when you're feeling down but at the same time you don't like drinking when you have more than you want it to and then the depression returns after you drink."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm. Yes, sometimes I feel worse after drinking.", "input": "", "output": "Where do you wanna go from here? What do you wanna change about your drinking habits?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't think that I'm ready to cut down to seven drinks a week. That seems like a lot but I would consider cutting back to two drinks a night. I think that would be my goal.", "input": "", "output": "If I gave you a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to cut back on drinking and 10 being very ready, what number would you be at?"}, {"instruction": "I'd say an eight.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Why do you think it's not something less like a six?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm more ready than a six because I'm ready to cut back on my drinking and I don't wanna make my depression any worse.", "input": "", "output": "What would help you cut back to two drinks?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe having less wine in the house.", "input": "", "output": "Having less wine in the house will help?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "What else besides drinking helps you relax and unwind in the evenings?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I like to watch movies, read a book, and take a bath but sometimes I drink when I take a bath.", "input": "", "output": "So, it's not just wine that helps you relax. Um, there's reading a book, watching a movie, and taking a hot bath too."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm. Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, it sounds like you have some reasons to cut back on drinking and you have ways to relax besides drinking and it sounds like you're pretty ready to cut back."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Great. I'd be interested to see how well you do on your goal in the next few weeks. Would you be willing to come back and talk to me about it?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Great. So, let's see how well you're doing with these new meds."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "And before you leave, uh, is it okay if we go over this screening form that you filled out today on your alcohol use?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Uh, thanks for filling this out. Uh, looks like you use alcohol two to three days a week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but only on the weekend.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And then when you do drink alcohol, you typically have five or six drinks."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Uh, maybe a couple more.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, the reason why I like to talk to patients when they fill out this form is because sometimes, uh, alcohol use can impact our health. Um, and my role is to be helpful. I can share some information with you about alcohol use, um, but I don't tell anyone what to do. It's always up to the patient to decide what they wanna do about their drinking. Um, so is it okay if we talk a little bit more about your alcohol use?"}, {"instruction": "So, uh, are you saying I drink too much?", "input": "", "output": "How would you define drinking too much?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I-- If-if I was getting fallen down drunk or if I drink every night. Um, it's not like I get sloppy drunk or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Well, in this country, the guidelines are men can drink up to 14 drinks a week or up to four on one occasion and still be low risk."}, {"instruction": "So I'm already at the week limit. And then I have four beers a night. Are you sure?", "input": "", "output": "So a limit of four a night doesn't feel right to you?"}, {"instruction": "I have five or six beers when I go out with friends to a bar. It's not a problem for me.", "input": "", "output": "You're not alone in feeling that way. Uh, binge drinking can feel normal to some people."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't consider my drinking binge drinking.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't chug a lot of beers in a row. I have about five or six beers throughout the entire evening.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Well, technically, we define binge drinking as having more than four drinks on one occasion."}, {"instruction": "But I'm healthy. What health problems are you talking about?", "input": "", "output": "Well, uh, we know if someone binge drinks over time, there's kind of two categories of risk. There's the short-term risk where someone who binge drinks is more likely to fall down, hurt themselves through an accident, uh, they're more likely to drive while under the influence. Uh, but over the long term, binge drinking can also, uh, cause things like heart disease, uh, different kinds of cancer, liver problems obviously, and then even mental health issues like depression and anxiety are more likely to happen."}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't know about those things.", "input": "", "output": "Can I ask you, uh, what do you like about drinking alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I-I like beer. I like the way it tastes, I like the way it makes me feel. Uh, like when I'm around friends and it's not a problem for me.", "input": "", "output": "And so what about your drinking do you not like or is there anything that worries you about your drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that was fine until I came here, uh, but now that I know about the health risk, uh, I have something I gotta think about.", "input": "", "output": "So, on one hand, you like how beer tastes, uh, it's part of your social life to some extent, um, but on the other hand, you don't like the idea of it posing risks to your health over the long term?"}, {"instruction": "E-exactly.", "input": "", "output": "So weighing those things, you know, what you like about your drinking, what you don't like about your drinking, uh, where do you wanna go from here? Uh, what would you like to change about your drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm, I'm not sure. Uh, something I have to think about.", "input": "", "output": "Well, how about hypothetically if I were to ask you, how would your drinking have to impact your life in order for you to be ready to change your drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I don't know. Maybe if I got sick or something, uh, maybe I'd wanna change things then.", "input": "", "output": "So if you experienced a negative consequence from your drinking, uh, that would feel meaningful to you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, I like to give this handout to patients. Uh, it defines risky drinking, it talks about what the consequences are, uh, and it also lists signs of what an alcohol use disorder is. So thanks again for taking the time to fill this out and being honest with me, uh, to talk about it. I provide better care, uh, when I know about my patient's substance use. When we come back for a three-month follow-up appointment for your ADHD, I'd also like to talk to you and check in about your alcohol use too, if that's okay with you."}, {"instruction": "Sounds good.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, great. See you next time."}, {"instruction": "Well, doc, I know you told me that I need to lose weight. And even though the scale didn't show today, I was able to lose about 5 pounds, but then I gained it right back.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront. Do you mind if we explore this issue further?"}, {"instruction": "No, by all means. I know we have to discuss it.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Uh, well, it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently. And I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have it come back again. So, tell me what you did to lose that initial 5 pounds."}, {"instruction": "I started watching what I ate and I ate less. I've been eating more fruits and vegetables. I've also been walking a lot. I'm walking up to 20 minutes a day now. I saw the weight come slowly off, um, and I felt better. But then when I watched it come back on again, you know, I gave up.", "input": "", "output": "But you did have some success. Tell me how you felt when you lost the weight."}, {"instruction": "I felt great and I felt really proud of myself. I thought that this was something that I could do.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, it sounds like you realized that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's gonna affect your overall health. So, tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back."}, {"instruction": "Well, I think it's because I've been eating more fruits and vegetables, that- that's it.", "input": "", "output": "And how many servings of fruits and vegetables on average per day would you have?"}, {"instruction": "To be honest, I have four or five -- four to six glasses of orange juice a day. Um, I have fruit for lunch and breakfast. I have, uh, usually one to two servings of a vegetable like lettuce or broccoli with thinner.", "input": "", "output": "John, it's very important that you recognize that some fruits, but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola?"}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't know. Um, but doesn't the fruit- food pyramid classify, um, fruit juice as a- a serving?", "input": "", "output": "You're absolutely right, but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only. When it comes to nutrition, we have to have a more personalized approach. So I have a hunch, and that is the excess fruit that you were consuming probably caused your weight rebound. What's your impression?"}, {"instruction": "Well, this changes quite a bit. I mean, here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter.", "input": "", "output": "Indeed. Let me ask you something, knowing what you know now, how important is it to you to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking in?"}, {"instruction": "Obviously, I need to cut back on the fruit juice. But boy, do I love that OJ.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I understand. Let me ask you this, on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 meaning that there's no way you can do it, and 10 meaning that you're 100% confident that you can do it, how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking in."}, {"instruction": "Um, six or seven.", "input": "", "output": "All right. So, you're not a zero. So, that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable, this is something you certainly can do it. Why are you not a zero?"}, {"instruction": "I guess it's because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight.", "input": "", "output": "So, you realize, again, that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in, you're gonna decrease your weight, you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna impact your po- health positively?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "But you're also not a 10, and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success. What would it take for you to be a 10 or even an 8 or 9?"}, {"instruction": "Getting the fruit juice of the house because I know if it's there I'll drink it. My wife does the shopping for us, so maybe if I ask her not to get the juice, that would solve it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Now, if the juice was still there, can you think of anything else you could do?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose I could replace it with, um, a low-calorie drink or drink more water.", "input": "", "output": "Excellent. John, I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction. And the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in. So if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're t- drinking and how you did it, what would you tell me?"}, {"instruction": "I'd say I didn't have any and I substituted it with, um, sugar-free drinks.", "input": "", "output": "Excellent. Well, it sounds like you have a plan. Same scale, 0 to 10, how confident are you that you can, uh, make this happen?"}, {"instruction": "A 10.", "input": "", "output": "I agree. All right. Well, you-you know what? I'm not gonna start any medications today. Your levels were a little bit off, but I think we can handle this from a purely lifestyle standpoint. What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "Great. It sounds good to me.", "input": "", "output": "Excellent. I'll see you in two weeks."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Well see, my-my wife's been getting on me a lot lately about trying to improve my health habits, and I really don't see what the big problem is. I mean, I've been working real hard. Sometimes I can't come home for dinner, so I'm having to go out to eat at Applebee's or something like that, so-- but she seems to have a bigger problem, I really don't see what the big deal is."}, {"instruction": "Well see, my-my wife's been getting on me a lot lately about trying to improve my health habits, and I really don't see what the big problem is.

Have you noticed putting on any weight, or anything like--?"}, {"instruction": "Well, a little bit, but nothing too-- you know. I'm not blo- I'm not bloated or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Okay. And how about going to see the doctor? Have you gone to-- for a visit or anything recently?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah, I've been to the doctor about maybe last year for a physical, but-- I mean, everything showed up to be fine, so\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Okay. But you feel that you feel good?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, and so what I hear is that you're-- you feel like your wife might be, uh, overreacting to this?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I mean, not really overreacting. I know that she loves me and I know she-she wants me, uh, you know, live a long time and be healthy, but just sometimes, especially if you work a hard job, like kinda going out to eat at these places kinda makes you feel a little bit better about your situation.", "input": "", "output": "Sure. Sure. Okay. Um, and so one thing I'd just like to do is maybe give you some information on, um, maybe obesity or diabetes if you're interested or open to that. If you're, you know--?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. ", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Good."}, {"instruction": "Hi.", "input": "", "output": "It's been a while."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's been a while.", "input": "", "output": "This is something new."}, {"instruction": "Oh, oh, yeah, the\u2014Yeah", "input": "", "output": "You got your lip pierced. How long ago did you get that done?"}, {"instruction": "About a month.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "What made you decide to get-get a lip piercing?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't know. I just felt like something different. I was getting bored and, I don't know, it's kind of nice to stand out a bit, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, change.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, and it looks nice."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Um, I guess, you know, as your dentist, I have- I have a couple of concerns about lip piercings, oral piercings. I wonder what have you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your teeth or your gums?"}, {"instruction": "I don't actually, really. I-I mean, I'm sure that it might push on my gums or teeth, but I don't know how much it will impact that much. I've pretty good teeth. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't really know ", "input": "", "output": "You do. you have beautiful teeth as I always tell you-"}, {"instruction": " Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "-every time you come in."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Um, I mean I have had some patients with oral piercings and they can erode some of the gum right, um, just right there at the front."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Um, so that's one-one thing, and the other is, um, I do see fair amount of chipped teeth-"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-just from contact with it. I wonder what are your thoughts about that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I definitely don't want it mess with my teeth. I know I kinda already have low gums to begin with, like you've been telling me for a while, and I have to flo-floss, which I-", "input": "", "output": "Yes, flossing."}, {"instruction": "Um, which I'm not doing but, um, yeah, I guess, I don't really wanna wreck my teeth 'cause-- Yeah, I didn't really notice any of the chipping.", "input": "", "output": "There's nothing yet."}, {"instruction": "I guess I'm not paying attention to it.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah.

So, okay, well thanks for-for talking about it-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-with me, and also before I do the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take -"}, {"instruction": "Hi.", "input": "", "output": "Hi, another session and another session where you are actually on time."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You've done-- You've got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, no, it's easy.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Yeah. You know, I've been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now.

Meeting's definitely helped.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's helped-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "-heaps.", "input": "", "output": "It's helped heaps?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with?"}, {"instruction": "Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff-", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "-and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that's a pretty big deal."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I'm wondering if the Billy of six months ago would've done that?"}, {"instruction": "Nah. I didn't really think about it frankly.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What's shifted in you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it'll make things easier.", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that's just really helpful.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, what did you say to Donna?"}, {"instruction": " Oh, I just said-- I said, \"Uh, could you give me a hand with this?\"", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "And, like, she filled them up for me, and I told her what to write.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, where did you get to in terms of telling her that, uh, reading and writing is not that  for you?"}, {"instruction": "Just-- I-I asked her to fill that out for me because I said I'd be too messy.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, I was thinking about how that stuff about not feeling confident around reading and writing has, um, really got in the way for you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And I mentioned that's somewhere where you don't feel so confident, and I'm wondering what it would be like to feel confident with reading and writing. What difference would that make to your life?"}, {"instruction": "Like, a big difference, but, like, it's not like I don't try.", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "Like, I'm just not really good with it.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Yeah, I can really see that you're making an effort. In fact, I can see that you're really making an effort in lots of areas, not just in terms of reading and writing."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Like  if I'd got into polytech and stuff, so I think that's good.", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, where are the forms now?"}, {"instruction": "They're still at home.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. If\u2014", "input": "", "output": "So, what needs to happen next?"}, {"instruction": "Just take them in.", "input": "", "output": "So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I'll just drop them in.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you're gonna do that?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, probably by the end of this week.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I don't know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don't even know any course that I'll do.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So what's the- what's the-- Say, if you get on the course-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-and, um, you're, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don't feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, um-- Well, I don't know. Hopefully, there's not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don't know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, all these changes that you've- that you've made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now?"}, {"instruction": "Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way.", "input": "", "output": "So, offending gets in the way of the life that you're starting to lead?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending?"}, {"instruction": "Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So you've noticed that when you've been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It's kind of harder to think straight.", "input": "", "output": "It's harder to think straight when you've been drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Yeah. And so you've got Donna around at the moment?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And that's helping keep you in check, as you said?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. What would happen if she wasn't around say or at a party or?"}, {"instruction": "I'd probably just go be stupid with my mates.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. 'Cause if there's just like if a mate said they're gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don't know. She say that's stupid and stuff. And I don't know. It gives me something to do.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "Just kind of stupid. Well, it's pointless, but still a bit of a laugh.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. Yeah. 'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you've got about the job and a life with Donna and-"}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "-kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn't fit in with that dream or that idea."}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "So there's that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there's the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you've had a few to drink and you're with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So you've got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "And it sounds like sometimes when you're in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it's hard to hold on to that vision of the future."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. You don't really think about that. Well, just in the moment.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking?"}, {"instruction": "Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking.", "input": "", "output": "Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next-"}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "-kind of minute or so-"}, {"instruction": "No. Just, like, it's not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So it's not your idea. And you also go along with it?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. You can't really be like, \"Oh no,\" just give me shit.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no?"}, {"instruction": "Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don't know. And they'd talk me into it probably.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So it's hard to actually say no to your friends-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-'cause of what they- what they thought of you."}, {"instruction": "They'd just think I was joking, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So I'm wondering what the-the thinking, 'cause, um, one of the things that's really changed for you is being with Donna."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So I'm wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys."}, {"instruction": "I don't see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't think, like, I am not sure they like it.", "input": "", "output": "Then so when you're-- so you're spending less time with them and more time with Donna?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. And you're saying you're kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you're spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past?"}, {"instruction": "They don't lead me into trouble. But-", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it."}, {"instruction": "Uh, like it's my choice though, they don't make me.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I know it's just having grown up with, it's just what we've always done.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So that's just what you've always done."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "But we're also talking about this idea that it doesn't fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are?"}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be?"}, {"instruction": "My life? Well, what do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "Mm, well the stuff about when you're in the moment. Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "When you've had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Just more or less like if Donna was there and maybe if my mates got some girlfriends or something like that would calm them down too.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "So just hang out instead of go and do stuff, like stupid stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So-so Donna's helped calm you down and you'd like, um, them to calm down too?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, 'cause then we could hang out together and stuff-", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "-with our girlfriends and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "So am I hearing that it's tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-now that you're with Donna?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Cause I like I feel guilty not spending my time with, yeah, Donna. Like, I miss my mates, like, I get lonely and stuff, but even though they get me into trouble, but-", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "-just, kind of, feel stoked that-that I see them on the weekends and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So-so what's the definition, for you, of a good mate?"}, {"instruction": "It's, like, loyal-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-yes, someone who's got my back.", "input": "", "output": "So, someone who's loyal, someone who's got your back, yeah? What else? What else is really your definition of a really good mate?"}, {"instruction": "That's about it. It's-- yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Someone who'll stand up for you.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, so, someone who'll stand up for you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah? Yeah. Sounds like a really strong definition of a good mate-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-for you? So, I'm wondering about, um, whether good mates lead you into trouble, if it's something you wanna do. If you got something different that you wanna do, what would a good mate do in that situation?"}, {"instruction": "I mean, support me.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. How-how would you wanna be supported, Billy?"}, {"instruction": "Just don't give me shit about, I don't know. Um, yeah, just, if I- if I don't wanna go do something, don't, like, don't give me shit about it.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. Okay, so that's-that's the kind of support that a really good mate would give you? It sounds-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-like these guys have been around for you-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, they ", "input": "", "output": "-for quite some time, and they're really important to you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Okay. So, I'm wondering how we can get to that point where, yeah, you can say, \"No, I don't wanna do that,\" and they're supportive of you?"}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think it would take?"}, {"instruction": "Just they know that I'm serious.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, how would they know you're serious?"}, {"instruction": "I guess, like, if they actually know I'm going to polytech and stuff that they might understand.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "But, like I feel guilty if they wanna go and have fun, and I'm not with them.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. That's the second time you've used that word 'guilty'."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah? So, it sounds like it's a really-- something's really important to you about that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Like, just going out with them or spending some times with them-- time with them, but, like, I really wanna spend time with Donna too-", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "-so, it'd be cool if we could spend time together, like, with Donna and my mates.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, it's almost as if you feel a bit torn because you wanna be with Donna, but you also wanna be with your-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-with your mates?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, like-- Well, I know I get into trouble with them, but they're still my mates, and I-", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "-feel--", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, so they're still important to you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I also am hearing that you don't wanna get into trouble anymore."}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. Yeah."}, {"instruction": "No problem.", "input": "", "output": "I saw that your doctor made the referral and, um, and I really appreciate you taking the time to come and make that appointment."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's-it's a bit of an inconvenience I'd say, but I'm here though.", "input": "", "output": "So you made it in here-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "- and do you have a sense of-of what some of the doctor's concerns were that led her to refer you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, something about changing my life even more. You know, the smoking's been changed, and now it's, you know, cut down the drinking, get rid of those extra smokes, get rid of my dog. I don't know what else have to do.", "input": "", "output": "So your asthma has been acting up and there's a lot of stuff, not just the asthma going on?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, there's a lot of stress too. My wife's still on maternity leave, she's not getting paid, she's with the baby right now. And I'm the only person that's working right now, and plus I got to change all these things that are going on in my life.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Almost\u2014"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's a lot.", "input": "", "output": "Almost overwhelming it sounds like."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, it is overwhelming. It is.", "input": "", "output": "Well, we have about, I guess, 15 or 20 minutes together and I wonder, would it be okay, if we took a couple of minutes and just kind of looked at all of the different things that are going on for you and maybe you can let me know, what would be the most helpful to spend-spend some time on?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it just feels like everything's all over the place but I guess we got to start somewhere.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, one of the things that-that we use are these-- it's kind of like a worksheet and it's an agenda-setting worksheet basically."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "So if you were to-to list all of the different things that people around you are saying that you need to work on or you need to change, what would some of those things be? And, Sal, just because we write them down here, it doesn't mean that you have to change them."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "It really-- You're in the driver's seat, so it's just to kind of put all the cards on the table, so to speak."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Um, okay, that sounds good. As long as I'm not changing anything and we're just kind of putting, um, I guess, pen to paper or something.", "input": "", "output": "Yep."}, {"instruction": "Um, okay, so my asthma.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so asthma is one."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "What else?"}, {"instruction": "Um, the fact that they want me to get rid of Oscar, that's-that's my dog.", "input": "", "output": "So your dog, and-and the doctor's saying the dog's\u2014"}, {"instruction": "Well, he's-- Yeah, he's saying it's a main-- It's a main contributor to my asthma problems.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Which I don't- I don't- I don't- I don't buy it and I can't just get rid of him like that, but it's something that's there.", "input": "", "output": "That's pretty shocking to be told that you have to get rid of your dog."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. The dog has been there before my wife. I know I've had him longer.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So that's a huge stress right now?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah, it's- it's a big stress, it's like my best friend, so that's one of the important things. Also, I guess, cutting down these last cigarettes I've been working on.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so smoking and-and I'm working towards quitting completely sounds like that's a goal for you?"}, {"instruction": "Um, finances is a problem right now too.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so money."}, {"instruction": "Time, I got to come to all these appointments and I'm taking time off work, which obviously is the money factor, right?", "input": "", "output": "Right. Right, right. So the appointments and time."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Um, and some of these things are kind of related to each other I think we're already seeing."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's something going on. And, um, also my drinking, I got to cut down my drinking too.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, wow. So there's a lot happening right now, Sal. Anything else that that's concerning you?"}, {"instruction": "No. It's just overwhelming when you see them everything they're, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Right. Well, so where would you-- I mean, if you-you had to pick somewhere, one or two kind of high priorities or-or things to talk about in our time this morning, where would you wanna start?"}, {"instruction": "I think- I think the thoughts about the dog has been definitely bothering me, that's been one.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "And, um, my-my asthma is out of control too. So maybe those two.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, and those are ones that are pretty related to each other-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "- sounds like. Okay."}, {"instruction": "Um, it's really stupid. Uh, I was at a pub crawl last night and you know how pub crawls are. You have a few drinks and then I thought it was a really good idea to catch up with my friends who are, yeah, they're in front of me. So I just like jumped off the stairs of the bus and I was wearing these like stilettos 'cause it was a 90s-themed pub crawl. Anyway, and then I just like fell on my ankle. It was really embarrassing.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a wild night."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "It was a lot of fun but I didn't do any dancing after that.", "input": "", "output": "No, I guess that that would be the end of your, uh, shaking and moving. I know-- I wonder if you'd be open to exploring your alcohol use and what that looks like during the week."}, {"instruction": "Uh, sure, uh, as long as we don't talk too much about like vodka 'cause I'm still, ugh, a little\u2014", "input": "", "output": "You're still feeling the effects of-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-last night, are you?"}, {"instruction": "A little bit.", "input": "", "output": "Oh wow, it was-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-really a rough night."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's normal.", "input": "", "output": "So what is a typical week for you as far as your alcohol use?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, me and my friends kinda, uh, we party on the weekend and, you know, we're all university students and so it's just normal, um, to have a few drinks.", "input": "", "output": "So a few drinks is nothing new to you?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "And what does a few drinks look like? Is that per night? Is it two drinks?"}, {"instruction": "Um, per night, uh, like if we go out oh, it's a lot. It's like I can drink probably like seven or eight drinks like if I'm going hard. Um, and then, you know, like maybe when I get home from school, a long day at the library, have a beer or two, so.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Do you have any concerns at all about your alcohol use?"}, {"instruction": "No. I-I don't know. It's normal for university students I feel.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so at this point, you're not too concerned and you think that, you know, this is what the other students are doing?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Would you be open to kind of looking at the low-risk drinking alcohol guidelines?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, sure.", "input": "", "output": "I don't know how you're feeling right now but I'm just wondering if we can take a-just a quick glance at this-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-and what the safe limits are for women is 10 drinks for women a week with about two drinks, uh, per day."}, {"instruction": "Oh really?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Wow.", "input": "", "output": "Where do you- where do you feel you fall into that?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, uh I would say a little over that.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, okay."}, {"instruction": "Especially with midterms coming up.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so it's kind of a way to cope through stress?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Right, and is that something that has been, you know, a way of coping for a while?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Does that concern you at all?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I mean, the 10 drinks seems like not a lot, uh, for like-for me and like my tolerance.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I guess I've kind of built it up over the years.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Um, so that's a little- a little bit, uh, concerning I guess to me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like you have any reasons to kind of bring your alcohol use down within the limits?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, any reason to? Uh, I guess health-health reasons.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me more about that."}, {"instruction": "Um, well, I mean, clearly I don't feel good right now. Um, and it's-- I definitely feel more productive when I don't have a hangover. Uh, so I see a benefit.", "input": "", "output": "So you can see some advantages to reducing the amount of drinking-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-um, that you consume during the week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah", "input": "", "output": "Is this something you would be willing to explore with me a little further at another time maybe when you're feeling a little bit better? Is this something you'd be willing to come back and talk to me about?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, I think when I'm feeling a little- a little better. Maybe when I haven't gone all out the-the night before and sprained my ankle.", "input": "", "output": "I'd love to, uh, set up an appointment for you if you can come in later this week or early next week to-"}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay.", "input": "", "output": "-kind of explore this a little bit further and maybe some of those advantages of reducing to the safe limits. Is that something that we could do?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. Yeah, just not on a Saturday morning. ", "input": "", "output": "That's okay with me."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Sounds good.", "input": "", "output": "So, what brings you here, Bob? What's, what can I do to help?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah, well, the only reason I'm here is 'cause my wife thinks I've got a problem with smoking. I've been smoking all my life and, uh, six months ago, uh, she thought, she got into this health kick, right? And now everyone who smokes is evil. And, uh, so that's why I'm here just to please her, get her off my back and\u2014", "input": "", "output": "So, you're not too happy to be here. This is the last thing that you want to be doing this afternoon."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. That's an understatement. I mean, I'm supposed to be at work right now, too, right? So-", "input": "", "output": "You've taken time off you, it's costing you time and money being here."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. I'm only here because my wife forced me to come, you know. Like this has come to a head six months of just nagging me, relentless every day, because she was able to quit smoking and now I have to quit.", "input": "", "output": "So, let me ask you this, Bob, what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she's concerned about my health and she cuts out all these articles from the paper about second-hand smoke and\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Wow, that she's been showing you and making you read."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I've got to read this. That's my reading assignment for breakfast and I want to go out and have-- We used to go out and have a cigarette together at the table. Now I have to go outside in this weather, you know, what's that about? And she used to smoke more than me and now she's like holier than now?", "input": "", "output": "So, you're pretty angry about it. It's pretty outraging that you're forced to change your whole life because of a decision she made six months ago."}, {"instruction": "And she's got my kids on this against me, you know, my son and my daughter, they're, it's like, they're ganging up on me, you know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "So, from your perspective, do you see any consequences to your smoking?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the big one of course is how it's affecting my wife and the family. Like my dad's 85, he still smokes. I mean, yeah, you know, sometimes I thought of quitting, but I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I can-- I don't know if I can quit.", "input": "", "output": "So, let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario 'cause there's a lot of pieces to it. Your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too. So, you're sort of isolated, you're put in a corner and you're being told this is something you have to do, you have no choice in the matter."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You have a few concerns about your health, but that's not really the driving force. It sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore. Does that pretty much sum up--?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah. I-I'm just, I don't want to lose her or my family over smoking.", "input": "", "output": "I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you. That you would do anything."}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah, I mean, we've been married over 25 years, and uh, we've never had any major problems. Like this is-- this is the first problem. I don't even really see it as a problem cause we used to both smoke and I was trying to accommodate them by smoking outside, but it's feeling like we're going like this and I'm just concerned, like if this keeps going, like.", "input": "", "output": "So, it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it, it's like it's all or nothing. Either you keep smoking the way you are, things continue to go downhill and get worse, your wife gets more and more on your case, or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again. It's almost like one or the other. It strikes me that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking."}, {"instruction": "So, I can actually do it that way like gradual taber?", "input": "", "output": "There are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt. Recognizing that it-it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be."}, {"instruction": "I wish my wife could have come today cause she's feels after like, just stop like right away. So do you think she could come with me at a future appointment or something and she could hear that message?", "input": "", "output": "If you wanted to bring your wife along, I'd be more than happy to talk with both of you."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'll have to talk to her as well because their schedule changes from week to week, she works shifts, so I'll call you back tomorrow and we'll set something up.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. That sounds good."}, {"instruction": "All right.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks for coming in."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "So now that we've discussed a little bit of your medical history and- and taking your vitals, I'd like to ask you a few more questions. The-"}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "-the rise in your blood pressure is concerning to me, so I'd like to gather a bit more information about your lifestyle."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Have you had any major stressful events recently or any change in your work situation?"}, {"instruction": "Not really, I haven't been stressed. Uh, I've been working steady, you know, these days, I'm glad to have a job, I really am happy that I'm working, so.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, that's certainly true. I'd also like to ask about some health habits that can contribute to high blood pressure."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, do you smoke at all?"}, {"instruction": "I don't smoke. I smoked, you know, as a young adult, quit 20 years ago. I went cold turkey. I was proud of that, haven't even thought about smoking.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, great. Um, do you drink alcohol, including beer or wine?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I do drink beer, I drink, you know, two to three pints on weekdays, sometimes on weekends, maybe four or five.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, I'm concerned about the amount that you're drinking currently. It sounds like you're having about 15 to 20 drinks per week, and that's definitely more than what we would recommend and could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure."}, {"instruction": "Well, I-- you know, my pressure has been high for years and, um, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Well, according to your chart, your blood pressure has gone up since July, and you said that you've been drinking more recently, so do you see the connection there?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe a little bit.", "input": "", "output": "Alcohol can have some dangerous effects on your body. So along with contributing to high blood pressure, it can have a big impact on your liver, which you need to keep in mind. So your liver has several different roles in your body. First, it helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body. It also helps process alcohol and other drugs. So when you have an excess of alcohol, your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up, and over time, your liver won't be able to work as well."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And how about the use of other drugs like cocaine, heroin, marijuana?"}, {"instruction": "I don't use heroin or cocaine. I've never even thought about using the hard drugs. Back in school, 20 years or so ago, I smoked reefer, you know. Once I got out of school, I haven't used that at all.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Have you ever used any prescription medications that weren't prescribed for you or in a way that wasn't prescribed?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't- I don't, uh, really like the idea of taking pills. Uh, as a matter of fact, a couple of years ago, I had this jaw surgery. They gave me a prescription for Percocet. I took one, maybe feel weird. I think they're still sitting in the medicine cabinet.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, excellent. Well, it sounds to me like the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. I think decreasing the number of drinks that you have when you go out and maybe decreasing the number of times that you go to the bar each week could be the best thing that you can do for your health."}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I'll try.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And then we'll set up an appointment for about a month from now. We'll recheck your blood pressure and see how you're doing with all this, sound okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, what brings you in?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm supposed to come to learn about my-- how to manage my diabetes. Just got diagnosed.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. I see- I see that your A1C or your blood glucose is very high."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's what doctor said. She-she really laid into me about that. Said it was-- I guess, this is really serious stuff. She was talking about losing eyesight, mm, my feet, mm, problems with a lot of other stuff, and it really scared me. Uh, so,  you know, how-how-how to manage all this, I guess, is what I gotta learn, but it just sounds massive.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Well, you do need to take your medicine. We, uh, will need to start dieting, uh, you know, lose some weight, change-change your eating habits, exercise, uh, to get your diabetes under control, because your doctor is right, it is very serious."}, {"instruction": "That's, uh, that's a huge amount of stuff to do and, I'm not- I'm not certain I can do all that, and on top of it, it's-it's-- if I don't get it all done, all this stuff happens to me?", "input": "", "output": "So, it sure can."}, {"instruction": "", "input": "", "output": "So, uh, you know, we-we need to start looking at doing all those different things to get your diabetes under control 'cause your-your number is very high."}, {"instruction": "Well, I-I ", "input": "", "output": "What else has brought you here?"}, {"instruction": "They found a little bag of weed.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's not a lot though.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's not like I was gonna sell it or anything. It's like\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Just enough for your own use?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, whatever, you know. It's California, no one cares.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."}, {"instruction": "How long is this gonna take?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, we-- You know, we have about 15 to 20 minutes to talk today, total. Um-um, which certainly it's just the first of-of some sessions that we'll have together over the next six months. It'd be a natural question you'd wanna know how much time this will take, of course. Um, what else would you like me to know about you and your perspective that you think will help me work with you over this time?"}, {"instruction": "I just wanna get whatever I need to get done, done.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. You're more focused on what you need to do to get this behind you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah", "input": "", "output": ".Okay, mm-hmm. Well, I'm wondering then if it's okay with you and-and I have a form that we can use if you'd like, um, just to put out some different ideas on an agenda that we could share as we're working together so that I-I can support you to be successful in getting this behind you. Would-would this feel like a natural time to-to move towards figuring out where we might go together?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So about how much are you smoking over the course of a day? You had said it had increased over once or twice a day."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, um, normally, I'm smoking, you know, like once in the morning, uh, once during my lunch break and then in the evening maybe like five or six.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So about eight cigarettes. So over the course of a day, just under half a pack?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And that's changed over what period of time?"}, {"instruction": "Um, honestly, it's probably been over the past year or so that I- I've been smoking a little bit more.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So over the past year, the smoking has increased. And that's been mainly in the evening?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Um, I have a two-year-old son as I mentioned, so I try to never smoke around him. So I'm normally kinda waiting until he gets to bed.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Well, that's the time when you can relax and unwind."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "So are there other things you do in the evening to relax?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I mean, maybe I'll have like a drink or two.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. A drink or two. So about how many drinks would you say you have over the course of a day?"}, {"instruction": "Um, maybe like two max.", "input": "", "output": "Two max. How many drinks would you say you'd have over the course of a week?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I mean, I don't really get why you're asking me that. I mean, I just came here, you know, for a regular visit. I-I am not here to talk about my drinking.", "input": "", "output": "No, I understand- I understand. And I'm certainly not here to tell you what to-to do, Sarah. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and sharing some information with you, and what you do with that information is totally up to you. You've got a lot going on. You're a mother, you're working, you're going to school, and our healthcare team wants to make sure that you have all the resources available to you to meet your goals, including good health. And my job as your healthcare provider is to listen to you and to share information with you, including healthcare concerns associated with smoking and alcohol. Would that be okay with you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, we do know that an increase in smoking and alcohol is associated with certain kinds of cancer; colon cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and, um, also pancreatic cancer. It's also associated with liver and lung disease as well as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. So that's a lot of information, but I'm-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-interested in what your thoughts are, Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Well, I-I'm just kinda surprised because, I mean, I don't smoke or drink that much. And I mean, compared to people I work with, you know, I-I smoke a lot less, and I feel like I've actually been trying to keep it pretty low.", "input": "", "output": "So you're consciously trying to cut back."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "I have a readiness ruler in my pocket here, 0 means not ready to stop smoking at all and 10 means absolutely ready to stop smoking. Where do you see yourself on that scale?"}, {"instruction": "Um, maybe like a five.", "input": "", "output": "About a five. So you're halfway there. So why did you choose a five rather than a four?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I mean, you brought up some kinda scary stuff like, you know, cancer risk or other things like that. And you know, being a mother, I-I don't want something to happen to me obviously.", "input": "", "output": "Right. Well, that's a lot of information to think about. So given, the fact that these healthcare concerns are a possibility, and that you're worried about your family and you certainly have goals you want to succeed at, where are you in your consideration to making a change? In other words, what steps would you consider taking for this number to move closer to a 10?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I mean, I could maybe try to cut back in the evenings a little bit.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, great. Let's quantify that a little bit. So how many cigarettes would that be?"}, {"instruction": "Well, right now, if I'm having like five or six, I could try to smoke three in the evening plus, you know, still the couple during the day.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So you-- that's cutting back quite a bit. That's a big step. So since we're kind of running out of time here today, I'm wondering if we could-- would be willing to come back in about four weeks to review this plan?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, good. So we can go over your laboratory results at that time, as well as review your plan. Now, would you like some information on smoking cessation?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I-I think that would be very helpful.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, I've got a brochure here and this has-- it's a really good brochure. It has some distraction techniques in it in case you get those nicotine cravings. So it's-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-been helpful, um, in-- with patients before. I'd also like to ask you, would you be willing to see one of our counselors?"}, {"instruction": "Well, what-what for exactly?", "input": "", "output": "Well, Dr. Kirtley is one of our counselors and he is an expert in-- at discussing the association between alcohol and stress. I want to share something with you. The National Guidelines recommend that women have no more than seven drinks of alcohol per week to-to stay at that low risk level, to avoid the healthcare concerns that we spoke of earlier."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "You've indicated that your alcohol consumption is a bit higher than that, putting you at risk. So that's why I asked if you'd be willing to talk to Dr. Kirtley."}, {"instruction": "I mean, I would like to talk about, you know, my stress, but I'm still not sure with the whole drinking thing.", "input": "", "output": "Certainly, certainly. I'm glad you're willing to talk to him. So before you leave here today, we'll, uh, stop by the scheduler's desk and make an appointment for you to see me back in four weeks, as well as the appointment with Dr. Kirtley. And that way, before you leave, you're all set. So do you have any other questions for me, Sarah?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, it's very nice to meet you. I'll see you in a month."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Hi, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to let you know that at this appointment, we're gonna be giving Lilly some vaccines."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I-I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. I've been reading a bunch of stuff lately about them.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Can you tell me more about your concerns about vaccines?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah, well, I was just- I was reading that it's better to let them build up their immunity, like, naturally and stuff in their immune systems.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so you were thinking that maybe exposing Lily naturally to these diseases would be a better choice than using vaccines to help her get stronger?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah. I mean, I had chickenpox as a kid, and now I'm immune. Right? So.", "input": "", "output": "That's right. Having chickenpox as a child means that you are less likely to have chickenpox as an adult because you've developed a-a natural immunity. Uh, but is it okay if I offer you a little bit more information about the other vaccines that we're- we were going to give her Lily today?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, okay.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, uh, before vaccines were developed, often when children had a natural exposure to some of these diseases, they ended up with, uh, sometimes death, disability, measles caused brain damage and, uh, deafness and blindness. Polio caused, uh, paralysis in children. And so, allowing children to have natural exposure to these diseases, sometimes was a little bit of a gamble, it could be dangerous."}, {"instruction": "Wow, I didn't realize it was so dangerous. I've never heard of polio.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Some of these things I've mentioned to you, you're-you're not familiar with. Uh, and I think that's because we've done such a good job of eliminating some of these diseases that a lot of people your age, and even my age, are unfamiliar with those things.  Um, so having shared this information with you, what do you think about the idea of vaccines for-for Lilly?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I guess it's okay. I mean, I just I want her to be healthy and safe.", "input": "", "output": "It's really important for you to make sure that she's protected and that you make good decisions and do your research before you make any medical decisions for her."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I just want to do what's right.", "input": "", "output": "So, again, I hear your overall goal is really, to not give up these things you'd like but to cut back on how much you have-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess so.", "input": "", "output": "-on that. All right. So, I'd like to ask you, uh, kind of a scaling question about this 'cause I'm hearing that this feels really important to you that you'd be way up there on the high- on the high end of importance."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, I'm gonna ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, \"I'm very, very confident,\" where would you put yourself on a scale right now of confidence in starting this new plan?"}, {"instruction": "Right now, I'm probably-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-gonna say a six.", "input": "", "output": "A six."}, {"instruction": "But I know when I go home and I see the food, it's probably gonna drop back down to a four.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. All right. So, let's talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're gonna be at a four."}, {"instruction": "Right?", "input": "", "output": "Okay?"}, {"instruction": "I guess.", "input": "", "output": "So, why are you at a four and not even a lower number? Why are you not like a zero or a one?"}, {"instruction": "Because I've been wanting to do this for-for years, like-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "-ever since I started becoming conscious of my body.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Like ever since I started being a teen, like this has always been a goal of mine, like, especially 'cause all my friends play soccer, and like-", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "-hike, and are like super stick-thin but really healthy and active.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "And so I'm just sort of like, well, I'm not.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "But I want to be like-- I don't want to be like stick-thin, but I really want to be like really healthy and really active.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "And like be able to look nice, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, all right."}, {"instruction": "I wanna be able to look nice.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, what would help increase that confidence? What-- Because that sounds like where we really need to focus on. What's gonna help you feel more confident about this?"}, {"instruction": "I don't even really know-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-honestly. Like, I mean, I know I'm gonna have to keep like telling myself like-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-like this is something that you want- that you've wanted-", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "-for years.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "Like, you can do it. Because like-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I know I can do it. Like I can do anything.", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "I can do anything-", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "-I know that. But it's hard getting to the point where I-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "-do something.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Well, if it's okay, just for a moment, let's put the- let's put the changing the eating pattern off to the side, and let's take a look at some other time in your life that there was something you really wanted to accomplish and you did. And what is it about you- what was it about you? What kind of strengths did you bring to the table that allowed you to tackle something that felt like a challenge and-and allowed you to be successful?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah. I just got off work, and apparently, they're going smoke-free, so I'm-- I-I thought I'd stop by the pharmacy here and see what my options are. Some of my friends have tried nicotine patches and the-- they say they don't work really well. I don't really wanna quit smoking, I just need something to get me through the day.", "input": "", "output": "So you want nicotine replacement, but you don't wanna quit smoking?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe like da-- during the day nicotine replacement. Is that-- I mean, do you have anything like that?", "input": "", "output": "We don't really recommend that. The idea is you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit, so then you wouldn't be smoking at work, but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't really wanna quit. I mean, I like smoking. I like go-- after work, I have a beer with my friends, and I'll smoke cigarettes. I mean, it's not really a big deal. Cigarettes aren't that bad. I mean, I know that the-- it's popular to say that smoking is bad for you but, you know, I like it, so I'm gonna be doing it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, smoking really is really bad for you, you know. It causes things like lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. Okay.", "input": "", "output": "-oral diseases."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, what are my options? You know, assuming that I'm right, what are my options?", "input": "", "output": "Well, to be honest with you, you mentioned the patch. I can't recommend a patch to you if you're gonna continue smoking. That can actually be pretty dangerous for you. In order to advise you about this at all, I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now."}, {"instruction": "Well, I mean, I s-- I-I-I smoke barely a pack a day. I mean, I've probably smoked for about five or six years now. It's not really a lot of cigarettes, but it's sort of hard to get through the day at work.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, we actually consider 20 cigarettes a day to be a significant amount, and in fact, I would then recommend to you that you would start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement."}, {"instruction": "Sounds good to me. The more nicotine, the better. Is it like gum or something? Could I chew it like while I'm in the office? That sounds pretty great. I mean, do you have\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Well, there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings, and probably the gum would be the best option for you. It's not something you would continue to use continuously throughout the day, however, but gum is something you use just when you have a craving."}, {"instruction": "Oh. Okay. Well, where is that?", "input": "", "output": "Well, we have that here, but again, the-the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking."}, {"instruction": "Well, I--  I'm probably not gonna buy anything today. I mean, I just came by to see what my options are. I-- if-- thanks for the input. I mean, do you have anything else, do you have any other advice for me?", "input": "", "output": "Well, aside from the gum, you could try the nicotine lozenge, that would be another option for you. Again, that's not something you'd wanna use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement, but again, that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke."}, {"instruction": "Oh, well. Okay. Well, thanks. I mean, I guess that helps a little bit. I'll-- maybe I'll be back later. Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Oh, it's a nice place. It's close to work. It's good living with a mate.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So, in terms of being supportive and a sort of support you're gonna need to make these changes."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "What's your thinking around that?"}, {"instruction": "That's the thing, isn't it? I am-- I don't know if it's the best place for me to be if I'm gonna make those changes.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "And Tristan is a good flatmate.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "I have no-- We're going in different-different directions now. He doesn't have the same kind of responsibilities I have and stuff, and so-- And I can't expect him to change his whole life around, just because I wanna change mine.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "I just-- I don't know how keen I am to move in with my- with my aunty and uncle, though.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. You're good to explore, but I just want to ask you about, how much does Chris-Christian-Christian know-- Tristan know about you changing your life? What does he really know about the changes you wanna make?"}, {"instruction": "I sit down and talk with him, asked him for, um, for support and stuff and he's fully, he says fully he'll be there for me. But, like I said, he's, um, he's in a different place in his life than I am in mine.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "He doesn't have kids.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "He doesn't-- I don't know if he can really understand what it means to me. Um, he's a good mate.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What are some of the pros and cons about moving in with wh\u0101na, moving in with your auntie and uncle?"}, {"instruction": "The food would be good. Um, I get- I get support with-- my wh\u0101nau is really supportive, but I'm- I'm worried about losing- I'm worried about losing my freedom. I'm worried about, um, about them taking over, or, you know what I mean? I have a freedom where I am now, I'm in charge of myself. That would probably be really good.", "input": "", "output": "In terms of that freedom and in charge of yourself, and the changes that we're talking about, and building your own family, and to enable you to do that, where do some of that freedom stuff sit with re-engaging back with your wh\u0101nau and your children, your partner? Is it something you're gonna wanna hang on to, or how you're going to manage that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't wanna hang on to freedom if it this- if it means that I lose my kids. Um, I'm just, uh, I'm just worried about-- I'm worried about if I move in with family, that they, even if their intentions are good-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I'll do anything to get my kids back.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so I'm just gonna ask you a couple of more background questions."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Do you use any tobacco products, or smoke cigarettes?"}, {"instruction": "No, I would bum cigarettes in college, but I was never a smoker.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. How about in the last year?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really anything.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And how often do you have a drink containing alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "Um, a few times a week. Uh, Wednesdays, I'll go to happy hour and have about two or three. And then, um, Thursdays, seven, um, seven or eight. Fridays, probably just a couple of glasses of wine with dinner. Um, but Saturdays are bigger night. And I would probably have a few drinks before I went to the bar. And then have four or five at when-when I was out. So\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So it sounds like you're drinking about four times a week, anywhere between three and eight drinks on a given day. So, maybe around 20 drinks a week?"}, {"instruction": "I guess, it sounds like a lot when you say  like that. But yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Do you use any street drugs like any marijuana, cocaine, heroin?"}, {"instruction": "No. I-I smoked weed in college, but just a little bit. I wasn't a regular smoker.", "input": "", "output": "Do you, um, do you ever use any prescription medicines that were not prescribed for you, or ever use your own prescriptions in a way on which they were not prescribed?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, you know, as we said before, you're drinking-- it sounds like you're drinking about 20 drinks a week, over the course of a few days. And I did want to point out to you that the recommended limit for women is actually no more than seven drinks a week, and no more than three on a given day."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "So you're doing more than that right now. And when you drink more than this amount, it puts you at risk for a number of things, okay? Things like greater risk of injury, damage to different parts of your body, um, just a bunch of different problems. And, uh-- so I'm going to recommend that you cut down- cut down that amount to the recommended limit. Again, that's no more than seven drinks a week and no more than three on a given day. Do you think you could do that? Would that be a good goal for you?"}, {"instruction": "That's a lot to change. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, I know that making changes isn't always easy. But when you drink more than what's recommended, it creates problems. You know, you said you hurt your ankle when you came out of the bar this time."}, {"instruction": "I mean, the stairs were really steep. So\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Well, it's possible you strained your ankle as a result of the alcohol. You know, it can actually affect your balance and stability. So, really, you know, for where you are right now, you're drinking a good amount more than what's recommended. And, you know, I want you to be healthy. And I don't want to see you coming back in here for something else. So I'm really gonna recommend that you try to cut down to that amount. So, do you think you could do that, cut down to no more than three drinks on a given day?"}, {"instruction": "Where are these limits from? Um, old- an older population? Because, uh, I drink just as much as my friends do. I mean, everybody drinks like I drink. I'm not even the biggest drinker in my group. So I'm pretty middle of the road.", "input": "", "output": "So, it sounds like, you know, the amount you drink is pretty normal-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-amongst the people you typically drink with. But these limits are-- they're actually recommended for all adults. And studies have shown that when you drink more than this, it creates a bunch of problems like we talked about. So, you know, why do you think you drink the amount you drink?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It's what we do. It's-- this is how we have fun, I guess. It is fun.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I think you can still have fun within these amounts. So that's what I'm gonna recommend. Um, I think this is a really good goal, and hopefully, we won't see any more injuries. Okay? So why don't you try that?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Thank you so much."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "So I get a sense it's a little anxious being here today and, uh, meeting someone like me, and, um, what we're gonna be doing today is-is inducting, but also I wanna talk about, um, yeah, the issues that-that have got you here and we need to do some sorting out around, um, yeah how serious you are to sort of sort those issues. So?"}, {"instruction": "I don't really know what issues I need to sort.", "input": "", "output": "Sorry?"}, {"instruction": "I don't really know what issues I need to-", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "-sort. It's just a bit of cash.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "So\u2014", "input": "", "output": "So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't think there is much to sort. I have a few drinks like everybody else my age.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Pokies are at the pubs for the thrills, it's no worries.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"instruction": "It's not an issue.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. See one of the things I'll be really interested in-in talking with you about is, um, yeah, what's-what's the, um, what's the worst thing that has happened in terms of pokies, in terms of you know behavior around the pokies, what's the worst thing that's happened?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I suppose when you've got no money in the pocket at the end of the night.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"instruction": "And some nights you do, so.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't really keep track.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. A few times a week.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Yeah."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It's if you're at the pub, you're, you know, that-that you're out there.", "input": "", "output": "That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So-so thinking about this, say a couple times a week, you know, two or three?"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's "}, {"instruction": "It's the unlucky ones.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue."}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um\u2014"}, {"instruction": "A bit of a rush, I suppose.", "input": "", "output": "A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I suppose.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I suppose it's lead me to be here, maybe. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you?"}, {"instruction": "Much the same, bunch of party girls.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't know. I suppose they walk away a bit quicker than me.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend?"}, {"instruction": "Sarah.", "input": "", "output": "Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "What would she say about\u2014"}, {"instruction": "We'd just have a laugh.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, no friends or friends should-- She accepts me for who I am.", "input": "", "output": "Absolutely, and that's what you want from friends, isn't it?"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "At times.", "input": "", "output": "At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. You don't have any money, so-- And that she-she'll probably be quite happy if I stopped.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "But, um, I don't know. She-she doesn't really discuss it with me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. But you owe her some money and you get the sense that-- Or I'm picking up, you get a sense that she's not terribly happy."}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does."}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "So the part of you that does see this is-- as an issue, yeah, that the gambling sometimes can be out of control, you know, tell me that part of you that-that maybe knows that, uh, it's getting you into trouble and it's gone way-- just moved you off from that point, there have been some\u2014"}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't know if pfft-- maybe I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for gambling 'cause-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "-you know, suppose in some way, I took the money for-for that but I don't know, you know? It's just a few dollars here and there and I didn't really think about it at the time, so-", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "-I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, and-and in some ways getting caught might be a good thing. I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money. So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I-I don't think it would have been too much of a problem. I mean I'm not a bad person, I wouldn't have, you know, wouldn't have continued to steal. It was just at the time that I was going through a rough patch. I wasn't intending to make it a long-term thing.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Yeah, so you're not a bad person. Certainly, I don't make judgments about people being bad people. So that seems sort of actually thinking about this, you sensed that you could've stopped."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Have you put on a kind of real hat, you know, you get a real hat here, you know? What-what's your hunch about that? Is it a kind of-- that kind of realization it's a bit of a smoke screen, what's your hunch?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, you tell me.", "input": "", "output": "How about then your-your kind of hunch about that?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I suppose I didn't expect the-the money would've added up to what it did, so I guess, at the time, I-  I wasn't thinking of the reality of it, you know, building up, so-", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "-you know, it did, so I'm here-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah-"}, {"instruction": "-so, I suppose\u2014", "input": "", "output": "-so, what did it add up to, at the end of the day? What are we talking here?"}, {"instruction": "It's a couple of grand or something.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah. It's a little bit here, a little bit there, so it then adds up, yeah? Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Well, that a little bit here, a little bit there is nothing I didn't work for.  I worked  and I was getting paid $18 an hour-", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "-$25, you do the math.  And that's gonna support me?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Okay. So-so, there's some-some questions you've got around some-some ways you, kind of, explained them. And then, as we work together, you know, we-- there might be some other ways we look at it and see it too, you know, that-that's part of working together. So, I'm wondering, how open are you to, you know, seeing this situation from lots of different angles?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I'm usually an open person. ", "input": "", "output": "Yeah? Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Just provided it will help me deal with it.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, what other things have you've been open to at other times in your life when you've been open to-to new ideas and being able to talk about stuff, that may be tough to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I am just usually pretty open with people. It's a bit different here tonight and-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "-just not knowing what to expect then\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, and-and, coming in, talking to a stranger, you know, and someone who can be honest to what you did, talking to a stranger, coming in this time, what do you sense about how you're doing so far?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I suppose I'm saying that the money did add up, and that was enough for me to end up here, so-", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "-I suppose I'm here for a reason. ", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. You know, like-- I-- And, some people wouldn't even, sort of, get in the door or wouldn't be as open as you've been today, okay, to an extent, so, you know, like I said, good on you, yeah. You know, being able to-- It's hard to come to a place like this and start to really open up, so, you know, you've just shown that you can do that. Yeah."}, {"instruction": "I didn't have a choice. ", "input": "", "output": "Well, you have a choice about what you open up to me about. Absolutely, you have a choice about that, yeah. That coming, being on sentence, no, you don't have a choice about that, um, well, you have a choice, 'cause, I mean, you can choose not to come, and you'll be breached and get to head back to court."}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "Um, but you do have a choice about how you are here when we meet, and what-what we talk about here. So, um, you know, so you do have lots of choices within that. And, my sense is you're, sort of, you know, a young woman who will make some good choices about that 'cause you're not a bad person, and you know that."}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I-I just-- I can't shoplift anymore. You know, I got- I got caught again. And uh, you know, I-I got suspended, I got back to school, so I'm-I'm uh-- I'm gonna mess up my whole life here, unless I can stop this.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's bad. My friends and I, we just-- I mean, it's fun and uh-- so I don't know what to do, but I- but I gotta change.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I want it.", "input": "", "output": "So, it sounds like you're ready. You're ready to give this up."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "But, maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear."}, {"instruction": "Right. I don't know what I'm gonna do, I got some friends. These guys are-- they're bad news, but they're my friends.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "And, uh, and it's fun.", "input": "", "output": "And it's fun."}, {"instruction": "You know?", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Nothing-nothing much else going on that's as fun as this. We go in, we steal these CDs. It was working out fine, but\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Um, I did wanna talk to you though. I'm a little bit concerned looking through his chart of how many ear infections he's had recently. And I-I noticed that you had checked the box that someone's smoking in the home. So I was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that."}, {"instruction": "Well, um, It's just me and him and I do smoke. Um, I try really hard not to smoke around him, but I-I've been smoking for 10 years except when I was pregnant with him. But it-- everything is so stressful being a single mom and-and my having a full-time job. And so it's just-- that's why I started smoking again.", "input": "", "output": "You have a lot of things going on and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Some people have a glass of wine. I have a cigarette.", "input": "", "output": "Sure. And it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. Why did you make that decision?"}, {"instruction": "I know it's not good for him. I mean, I've read those things about ear infections and asthma and stuff and-and, uh, but other kids have ear infections and their parents don't smoke.", "input": "", "output": "So on the one hand, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems?"}, {"instruction": "Right. Yeah. I mean, he doesn't have asthma. Yeah. He-- I don't-- he hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other friends have, so. And I've thought about quitting before in the past, but I just don't- I just don't see how it's possible right now.", "input": "", "output": "What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he was inside me and we were sharing everything and I knew that he would get some of that. And I didn't-- I just didn't-didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him.", "input": "", "output": "Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, exactly.", "input": "", "output": "How were you successful when you quit before?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I-I think about it now, I don't even know how I did it. I just- I just did it. You know, I just- I just couldn't imagine like him not being born or going into labor early-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-and-and him having problems and stuff like that, all the stuff that they talk about with women who smoke. So I-- that was just enough to-to say, \"Okay, you know what, I'm-I'm not going to risk that.\" so.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "But they don't feel as scary to you now?"}, {"instruction": "No, I mean, we're two separate people. And like I said, I don't, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I'm pretty good about that. I-I don't let other people smoke around him. Um, so I, you know.", "input": "", "output": "You're doing the best you can do."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. But it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I-I know that I need to, and I, you know, keep every new year I say, \"Okay, this year I'm gonna quit smoking\" but then something happens and it-it just doesn't. And quitting doesn't happen.", "input": "", "output": "It's on your to-do list. It's just not making it to the top?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "If you did decide to quit on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and you don't think you could do it and 10 is you feel pretty certain that you could, where do you think you fall right now?"}, {"instruction": "Probably like a 5 . Kind of in the unsure area. Like I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it, but at the same time, it just seems really hard. And it's not the same situation.", "input": "", "output": "Well, what made you say five rather than two or three?"}, {"instruction": "I know- I know all the ways it's bad for me. And I don't want him to grow up thinking that it's okay to smoke. I don't want him to-to use any kind of-- I don't want him to chew or anything like that. Um, so I know I need to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy's doing, but I just don't know if I can do it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So it sounds like you have a lot of reasons why you'd like to quit. You have been successful quitting in the past, and right now you're just feeling a little bit hesitant about your ability to do it?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Where do you think we should go from here?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I-I'd like some help. I just don't know what kind of help I need.", "input": "", "output": "Sure. Well, if you'd be interested, that's something I can definitely talk to you about. There are a lot of new options that can actually help people be way more successful in their attempt at quitting. There's different medications you can try."}, {"instruction": "I don't like medicine.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people to go through it with you. And sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you where smoking is such a stress reliever."}, {"instruction": "That sounds nice, but I'm not sure if I have the time for all that.", "input": "", "output": "Sure. It feels like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life. I wonder if we could talk about some options that might fit into your life."}, {"instruction": "That would be really nice.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, if you're willing, then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about that."}, {"instruction": "I would like that. That would be great.", "input": "", "output": "Great."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "Hi.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Does that sound okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life?"}, {"instruction": "Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college.", "input": "", "output": "Hm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "That's great."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "So, maybe move away for college.", "input": "", "output": "Cool."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, kind of keeping your options open."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, definitely.", "input": "", "output": "Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, maybe um, pre-law.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun?"}, {"instruction": "Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-something like that, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You like to have a good time?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "So, I'm like normal.", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good way to be, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. ", "input": "", "output": "All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now?"}, {"instruction": "Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Through college.", "input": "", "output": "Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you?"}, {"instruction": "Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "What's important to you about your family?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me-", "input": "", "output": "Hm."}, {"instruction": "-and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.

What do you know about how that's dangerous?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment.

So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are, you know, carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it.

How were things after you moved out?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I thought that they'd be better, but 'cause I thought I'd have to kind of be independent and I suppose actually a lot worse. So I'm-I'm just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don't really have any friends or anything. I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it's not-- I don't know. It's kind of scary because I've just been kind of-- that should just end the flight by myself, which I always thought I'd like, but I don't actually like it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So what other kinds of difficulties that you have been experiencing?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I mean, I'm-I'm a photographer. Um, so I kind of-- It's-it's been stopping me a bit, my anxiety, from being able to get work and because every time, you know, there's, uh, an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people, I just tend to just turn it down. So it was kind of making things hard in that respect and um, just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I'm just kind of increasingly more alone. So it's kind of stopping me from making friends and, you know, like relationships and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So you said that, um, your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things. So they're, they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer, I guess that- that can be kind of a problem. And they're also stopping you or you feel like it's stunting you, uh, socially. You're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. Um, it was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously, I mean, my parents, so it's fine, but you know, they would, I'd go to places with, um, or I'd kind of have people there, but more and more, I'm just finding myself just staying in a lot. I mean-- I went like two weeks ago for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don't, I just don't want to-- I don't want that to happen. I don't want to lose everyone. So-", "input": "", "output": "So you're kind of worried about how, where this is going to lead to."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.

Um, and I mean, I-I've always been a bit shy, um, at school, but it was never ever, uh, like it didn't really affect the things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years ago, I guess. It just started when I- like my friends went to university, and, I don't know, I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of escalated from there.I just stop going to parties or I'd just say no to invitations or I don't know, I thought my job would help because I mean, I love it. I've- I really like doing photography, but I'm just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on, so, which is my thing, you know, but\u2014", "input": "", "output": "What kind of work is the most difficult for you in your job?"}, {"instruction": "I guess when it- I have to kind of be working with other people.

So I just don't do it.", "input": "", "output": "So I guess, tell me a bit more about what happens then. So let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with, uh, you know, it's going to involve, uh, photography with- with a group of people and you're going to have to have social interaction. What kind of thoughts go through your head?"}, {"instruction": "Um, just, I mean, I get really hot and sweaty, and I don't-- I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid, and I feel like they're all going to be staring and thinking, I just can't do my job. And I'm just an idiot. And I mean, they'll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and-- I mean, I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else. So that's why I like doing shots where it's just me and the camera 'cause I- then I can just put all my attention on that instead of having to, you know, be with other people.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation and you think, \"People will look, people will stare, people will think I'm a weirdo.\" So there's quite a lot about what you- what you think other the people will think. And how does that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Um, just makes me feel like an idiot, makes me feel like I just shouldn't even bother trying to do it anymore. I should just go home and I just-- I think I just don't want to be in that situation. I just feel like everyone else is fine and they're normal and I'm just the freak, you can't, like do normal things and\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Can you give me an example of a-a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that."}, {"instruction": "Um, like a work situation or just--?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety, you know, that you're describing, you felt that kick in."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I was doing a job where it was kind of like a- a Nature issue and I was having to work with a lot of different people. Um, and, um, when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine.

Why was that helpful?"}, {"instruction": "Cause I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought, at least if I can just-- I don't know. It sounds weird, but I was just trying to keep my hands still on it.

I can quit.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What makes you so confident?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I mean, I don't see why I couldn't, I-- although I have not ever tried to quit, it's just something that I do for fun, you know, on breaks at work, in the morning, and after work.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. And so in terms of, uh, uh, readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt, where do you think you fall on the scale of 1 to 10, where one is, I'm not considering it at all, and 10 is, I'm definitely ready, I wanna quit."}, {"instruction": "I am probably a two. I-I haven't even thought about quitting and until this great announcement at work today, I- I'm totally not gonna quit smoking.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What made you say two instead of one?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I mean, anything's possible. I mean, I-I guess I could maybe be convinced. Yeah. Is there some-- I mean, are there things I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking?", "input": "", "output": "Well, there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke.

Well, that\u2019s good information. I mean, I'm not gonna do anything today. I just need to know my options, but that's encouraging. If I decided to quit smoking, I-I do have at least tools to help me.", "input": "", "output": "Sure. And back to that scale, you mentioned, you said you were a two. What do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I guess if my friends, like if one of my friends decided to like quit with me, that would probably help too, but I-- all my friends love to smoke, so I don't see that happening in the near future.", "input": "", "output": "Sure. I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-free, if there will be some people at work who planning to quit."}, {"instruction": "That's a good point. I hadn't really thought about that. That-that's a good idea. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, it sounds like you're really here just for information today.

I felt good about myself, and just in general, exercise, I know, makes me feel good. I want to be a good example for my kids. I want them to feel like that's a part of life-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-exercising.

I'd probably have to sit down maybe with my husband and try to figure out a good time for me to be able to do that, where he'd be home with the kids and I'd be going to do that, whether it's morning-time, evening, maybe the weekends.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Just to find the time to be able to do it, or what works in our schedule.", "input": "", "output": "So, it's that balance of doing something for yourself, but it sounds like you don't want that schedule to affect too much into your family routine."}, {"instruction": "Right, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important, where would you rate yourself on how important it is to start exercising more?"}, {"instruction": "Mm, I would like to say a seven or an eight, that that's how important it is to me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, and how come not at like a five or a six?"}, {"instruction": "Because I'm really sick of being overweight.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Not ha-- I just don't like being unhealthy. It doesn't make me feel good, so I'm motivated to change, it's just getting there.", "input": "", "output": "So, to summarize, it's important for you to do this. You're starting to feel sluggish, you're not feeling healthy, and you know that you've got other people in your family watching you, and you want to be a good role model for them to know that this is gonna be just a part of your life, is your exercise. Yet for you, you're struggling just a little with the logistics of when to schedule time for you so it doesn't interfere too much with your family."}, {"instruction": "Exactly, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, knowing this, what do you think you'll do next?"}, {"instruction": "Mm, I'll probably, I don't know, find-- Now, while it's still somewhat okay outside, maybe pick days I'm gonna go for walks or runs, um, maybe look for a gym close to the house so that I know I can go there quickly or maybe that has daycare, um, yeah, maybe I'll just start to look for that, and find ways I can do it first.", "input": "", "output": "That's great.

Yeah, you used to have contact with your mom, you know, almost every other night and now for just about a week, you haven't even gotten to talk to her. I can imagine that being pretty difficult. I remember you saying something about like your dad's birthday coming up?"}, {"instruction": "My dad's birthday is tomorrow.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "And I just wanted my call so I can talk to my mom. That's it.", "input": "", "output": "Like I said, it's been, um, a long time and this is basically the first time that we've seen this behavior from you, so I know for a lot of other guys right before they get out, uh, a lot of anxiety, a lot of frustration comes around because they haven't been out in a while and then like the pressures of being on the outside are starting to settle in.

He hasn't made me die in 12 years, and the doctor is saying, \"Oh, I don't know if it's the stress, the finances, the drinking.\" So, what are we doing saying Oscar could make me die?

When you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope for when you look ahead?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I-I kept the kid because I wanted-- It was almost like that push, that sign for me to, like, move forward and become like an adult because it's scary, right? Like I-I still feel like a teenager sometimes. And having that push to be a real person is really-- It's a lot of pressure and I-I want to raise this kid well. I don't wanna- I don't wanna let my kid down. I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna regret choosing to have this kid because I think it's the right time, but I don't wanna- I don't wanna make mistakes that make me realize maybe I'm not ready for this 'cause sometimes it feels like I'm not ready for this.", "input": "", "output": "You put your heart there that the baby is really- it was almost kind of like a sign for you that was saying, \"This baby is giving you a kind of a new chance at life, or giving you a plan B,\" and you guys both get to decide what plan B is gonna look like."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I just guess it's easier said than done though.

And I'm just- you know, you can't just one day flick a switch and become a new person.", "input": "", "output": "While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you're wondering, \"Do I deserve that second chance?\" And then this other part of you that says, \"Why not?

You got a lot of people around you that are kind of pulling it down, and it's kind of taking you back to the old life.

I don't really- I don't have any other choice. Like I have to- I have to take that path.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that, what makes you say, \"I have to take that path\"? What makes you feel like you need that?"}, {"instruction": "Because I need to for my kid.

You--\" Maybe it would, you know, give them a wake-up call too if They actually, like, see it.", "input": "", "output": "So you're thinking that, um, once your friends see you with the baby in your arms that they too will see that there's a different path for them too?"}, {"instruction": "Or at least they'll feel less pressure to be who they want me to be.", "input": "", "output": "Mm, kind of feel like you're pulled between two worlds there."}, {"instruction": "A little bit.", "input": "", "output": "It's not easy to be in that world and also having that constant reminder that the baby is coming and this baby is saying, \"I want this better life,\" and you want to give the baby a better life too.

You kind of wanna have the best of both worlds."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "I want the friends and the relationship that I get from my friends, and at the same time, I don't want the party scene that goes with that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, like I-I know I just can't cut off my friends altogether.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Nina, you know yourself best, and you know, you know, you know what your world looks like and what those, you know, like, you know the support that your friends give you and the support that you get from your family, you know that.

Um, and I'm just wondering if maybe we can kind of pick this up, um, in a next visit, but before we go there, I'm just wondering, is there some steps that you would be willing to kind of take or consider, uh, with-with regards to your drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Um yeah, like I'm so close anyways, that I know I need to now. Um, and I just also, like, have I completely screwed this up, like, is it already too late?", "input": "", "output": "You're concerned about the health of your baby. I just would love to share with you, Nina, that every day without alcohol is a good day for your baby, and you know, starting today to have zero alcohol is a great start, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of something you'd be open to as no more alcohol at this point."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm, I have to do.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, sounds like this is really important to you. You want to make this happen."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Is there anything that I can support you with before we wrap up as far as giving up alcohol today?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.

Nice to meet you.", "input": "", "output": "Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for coming in today."}, {"instruction": "Thanks for having me.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Tell me a little bit about yourself."}, {"instruction": "So I am, um, 28. And I moved out to Arizona about six months ago. Um, I really enjoy spending time with my family and hanging out with friends whenever I can. Work keeps me pretty busy. Um, But I'm really, um, looking to kind of make some changes to my diet and physical activity. I'm not really happy with where my weight's at right now, and, uh, so I thought it'd be good to come and talk with you about some of that stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, you're feeling a little bit dissatisfied with your health patterns?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Um, I'm really starting to notice how I feel more sluggish and just not-- My mood is shifted a lot too, which at first, I thought was because it's getting colder outside, um, but I do also think it maybe has some relation to my activity, or lack thereof, and also kind of the foods that I'm eating.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so you're feeling some low energy and you know, in the past, when you've been more active and eating differently, you've had more energy?"}, {"instruction": "Right. Yeah. Especially during times when I'm more active is when I noticed the biggest cha-change in energy and mood.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Tell me more about that, those previous times that you've been active."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Um, well, I played sports in college, so that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun, um, and I just think back now to, as much that I would cram into a 24 -hour period, and like, wonder how I did that, but I think that part of it was because I was so active physically, um, I just had way more energy throughout the day, mentally and physically to, um, you know, go to school full-time and-and still socialize with friends and do all that stuff. Um, so when I think back to like, probably like the peak of my life of when I felt my best physically, mentally it was that time.", "input": "", "output": "You had energy, and you were like the Energizer Bunny, just keep going and going and going."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, exactly. And now it's not so much the same. Um, like when I get home from work, I'm pretty exhausted, uh, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a computer and thinking and working. And so, um, yeah, that's probably been my biggest, uh, issue is like when work ends, going home and not really doing anything. Um, just trying to like unwind by watching Netflix or something else, right?", "input": "", "output": "So your days are just as full now that you're working and a career person, um, and your energy level isn't what it used to be. What-- Do you have any ideas about why that might have shifted?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, I think part of it is that when I was in college, it wasn't really an option to go, like, I had to go to practice or I had to do those things because that was, in a sense, my job that was paying for school, um, and now there's not that same commitment to other people or to scholarship money. So that definitely has shifted, um, but I-I do feel like a-an urgency to go it just doesn't seem that like the step that's missing is for me to actually go to a gym or somewhere to be more active. Like, I think I want to it's just the doing it that seems to not happen.", "input": "", "output": "Right. So in the past, it wasn't up to you whether you had the choice to go be physically active. Now it is up to you, and-and you're looking back at the last few years and saying, I wanna do things differently."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "I want to be more physically active than I've been."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, I think so. Um, that's not to say like, I wanna go run a marathon but I do think that it would help me a lot in terms of just having a better outlook on life, um, and better energy to- if I were to pick up some type of activity.", "input": "", "output": "Great. And you've noticed a mood enhancement effect of exercise."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me more about that. What do you notice specifically about your mood on the days you're physically active?"}, {"instruction": "Just, I'm-I'm just happier and more upbeat and I think that even my outlook is more positive. So like, if I'm sitting in traffic, and I haven't been physically active, I'll probably grumble about it but if I'm sitting in traffic, and I have been, it's like, I just have a different outlook on things and I already feel like I've gotten something accomplished that day. So it just kind of like helps with that ripple effect into my day of like getting more things done.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, you feel more accomplished and-and you feel less irritated by the small stuff."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly.", "input": "", "output": "Great. Well, let me see if I've got this all. You came to Arizona six months ago, you're trying to figure out new rhythms and patterns for yourself. You're looking back at the past few years, and in college, you were real active because you were an athlete, and now it's more up to you about making that choice of physical activity, and you're discovering that, um, not being active has affected your energy level and your mood, and that's something you're looking for more of, both of those things, energy and-and a mood booster."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And then also to, um, like I mentioned, I'm not totally happy with my weight, um, and so hoping too that that would have some impact there and-and maybe help me, um, if my activity kind of gets resolved or improves, then my nutrition also, maybe would go along with it and get better.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Tell me more about your weight concerns. When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, probably about three, four months ago. Um, yeah, just my clothes started fitting tighter, which wasn't as comfortable, and, um, yeah, just not really super happy with my appearance, which has never really been an issue, um, in my life up until now. I've usually been pretty okay with that, and then in the last three months, I just feel, um, like I've had a lot more of a negative outlook on it.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Okay, so it sounds like a sort of a vicious cycle and-and maybe the lacking physical activity has made you feel less confident in yourself. I wonder if that's also a piece of this puzzle since you mentioned that's been a big difference from what was happening in the past."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think- I think the activity piece and then also to like, the foods that I'm eating, I don't think are that great. So that also kind of does the same thing, I think, to my appearance or the way that I viewed myself.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So you had a pretty strong self-confidence, pretty strong body image all the way up until a few months ago and, um, you're hoping to kind of get back to that place where you feel good about yourself."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Great."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Morning.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, there."}, {"instruction": "Hello.", "input": "", "output": "My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind.", "input": "", "output": "All right. So, quite a few symptoms there-"}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "- and some of them sound-"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "- quite troublesome to you."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And how long has this been going on?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before?"}, {"instruction": "Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines-", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "- for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the-"}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "- the herbal shop-"}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "- how are you taking them?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day-", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "- so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and-", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "- other tablets for other things.", "input": "", "output": "So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis-"}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "- what you're gonna take-"}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "- depending on what your stomach's doing?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called?", "input": "", "output": "A gastroscopy."}, {"instruction": "That's it. Yes.", "input": "", "output": "You got the tube down-down from the top?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "That was very uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything-", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "-and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now-", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "- as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that."}, {"instruction": "Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's-", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "- decided that I've had enough tests.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "- there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it.", "input": "", "output": "Right.

And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact.

Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you.

And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests."}, {"instruction": "So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown.

What does it tell me about you as a man, as a father, as someone who wants to get moving?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I hope it tells you that, um, that I'm a good bloke. That I'm a good dad.

Um, and she's not completely convinced.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "Um, but we'll see how it goes.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So what do you think you're gonna need to do to show her and others, uh, to convince them that you are serious?"}, {"instruction": "I need to, um, I need to see all these things that I've started to put into action, I need to see them through to the end.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well. I need to- I need to, uh, to show her that she can trust me. That I'm serious about it.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, um, last week I met with my nurse practitioner, and I ge-I guess she's worried with how much I'm smoking and drinking right now.

So, you know, i-it's just a lot right now.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, it does. It sounds like a lot that you're trying to deal with, and it makes sense that you feel like you need some kind of break or reward."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "So, tell me a little bit more about your drinking. Tell me a little bit about how much you're drinking, and, um, the pattern, and what raised concern."}, {"instruction": "Well, that's the thing. I-I don't really understand what raised concern. I mean, I don't drink that much, you know. I've-I've gone up to maybe two drinks a day max, you know.", "input": "", "output": "So, you're drinking, perhaps, two drinks a day. Um, and I'm wondering, what have you heard about the recommendations for drinking levels?"}, {"instruction": "Not much.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, will you be interested in hearing about those recommendations?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, so, the recommendation for women is to have no more than three drinks a day, and no more than seven drinks over the course of a week. Yeah, um, and, really, the reason for those recommendations is to just reduce the risk that people have trouble with accidents, or chronic diseases. Like certain types of cancers, or high blood pressure, and then also psychological problems. I don't know what you think about all that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, i-it just surprises me because, I mean, two drinks a day, that-that doesn't seem like a problem or risky, you know. And, I have family members who drink a lot more than that per day, and, it's not a problem for them. So, i-it just surprises me.", "input": "", "output": "It just doesn't seem that abnormal to you, especially when you compare it with your family."}, {"instruction": "No. And then, I don't know, I-I'm just getting kind of annoyed, honestly, because, you know, I did agree I would try to work on my smoking, you know. But, with this whole drinking thing, it's like everything that I enjoy, you know, is being taken away from me right now. And so, if I give up drinking, like, what am I going to have to enjoy myself, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, you really feel like you need that reward."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And then it also sounds like, um, your drinking has perhaps increased a little bit over time?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I mean, I guess it has. Probably just with being so stressed out every day, you know. I mean, I'm in my second semester of school right now, and so, adding that to everything, uh, it's a lot. And, you know, I'm trying to figure out child carry. Um, normally, my mom will watch my son, but, lately, she can't always. And so, I'm always kind of worrying like, will she be able to, you know. So, i-it's just stressful.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, and so it sounds like you've noticed that the more stressed you're feeling, the more you're drinking."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I-I guess that's right.", "input": "", "output": "So, let me summarize a little bit what you've told me. It sounds like you have a pretty hectic, stressful life, and you really feel like you need some kind of-"}, {"instruction": "Uh-huh.", "input": "", "output": "-reward or stress relief. Um, and then, on the other hand, you've noticed, um, that your drinking has increased a little bit over time. And also that the more stressed you're fe- you feel, the more you're inclined to drink."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, I'm wondering, have you noticed any problems from your drinking?"}, {"instruction": "No. I guess, you know, the one- the one thing I can think of is, I mean, there will be evenings when I just kind of want to get my son to bed a little earlier, just so that I can have that alone time to unwind, you know, maybe-maybe smoke, have a couple drinks. Um, but, I do feel guilty about that sometimes, because, I should enjoy spending time with my son, but, instead, you know, I'm just wanting to be by myself and relax, you know. So\u2014", "input": "", "output": "So, you've noticed that it's starting to call to you a little bit in the evenings."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And it's perhaps taking you away from things that are more important to you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And it doesn't feel good?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. And so, it sounds like there's a bit of a dilemma there, because-- And I guess we should be clear, it's not the occasional drink that's an issue. Um, it's-it's really the quantity of drinking, and-and whether your drinking is escalating and interfering with things that are, perhaps, more important."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And you've perhaps never seen it in that light before."}, {"instruction": "No. And, i-it's just, it's really hard to take in right now. I mean, yeah. I-I've never thought about it like this. And, so, you know, I-I do feel kind of worried.", "input": "", "output": "I-it seems like it-it would be quite a hard pattern to change."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I mean, i-it's part of my routine right now, and, you know, I-I don't want to sacrifice something I enjoy, but, you know, I'm trying really hard, you know, to be a good mom. I'm-I'm trying to, you know, go-go back to school. I'm trying to work. So, I don't know how I can do all of that if I don't have a way to enjoy myself or relax, you know?", "input": "", "output": "So, it seems like it would be really difficult to change because it's something that's really important to you right now."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "But on the other hand, it does sound like there are things that you- that you value that you don't want the drinking to interfere with."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, I guess I'm wondering if you've given any thought to other ways in which you could cope with stress without relying on the drinking so much."}, {"instruction": "Well, you know, if there was some way that I could relieve some of my stress, I think I would feel better, and, you know, maybe at night, I wouldn't feel like I had to unwind in the same way.", "input": "", "output": "So, if you could somehow tackle some of these stressful issues, um, that could make a difference, and, what-what would that be, for example?"}, {"instruction": "Um, you know, probably my biggest problem is just childcare. You know, my mom normally watches my son, but she's been kind of backing out lately. And so, I'm worrying, am I going to have to call into work today, am-am I going to have to miss class? You know, so, you know, worrying about that really stresses me out, you know.", "input": "", "output": "So, having more reliable childcare could make a big difference."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, definitely.", "input": "", "output": "And it sounds like your mom has been an option in the past, but perhaps not so much anymore."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I mean, she watches him so much. I think she's just probably getting stressed out too. And, I feel bad because, you know, it's not her son, so i-it shouldn't be her problem, but, I need something that I can rely on better.", "input": "", "output": "So, one thing that could make a big difference is if you could figure out some sort of more reliable, affordable childcare, and that would help you not want to drink as much."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I mean, most of my problems always go back to money. You know, i-if I had more money, I could afford daycare, I could work less hours, you know? So, yeah. It's-it's normally related to money.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. It-it sounds like, um, you know, money could make a big difference, and you are working full time and trying to go to school to address that in the long run. Um, but on the other hand, you know, it sounds like you have some other ideas of cope- of how you might cope with stress better. Um, so, I guess I'm-I'm wondering, given our conversation so far, kind of where you are with everything."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I mean, I'm ready to consider changing my drinking, but, as far as actually doing it, I-I don't know. I mean, I have a lot of problems that I'm trying to work out right now.", "input": "", "output": "So, um, it would perhaps be helpful if you could narrow it down to just one thing, and what would that be?"}, {"instruction": "Childcare, probably.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Yeah. It sounds like from everything you're saying, that keeps coming up as one of the main issues. Um, so there may be some resources I can point you towards, but I'm- guess I'm wondering, have you looked into alternatives, more affordable, reliable childcare?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I mean, I just normally see if my mom can watch my son, so, you know, I haven't really looked around.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, one thing you could consider is talking to one of our social workers, they sort of specialize in helping people who have a lot on their plate identifying resources that they may need, uh, things you haven't thought of or aren't aware of. So, I don't know, would you be interested in doing something like that?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, definitely.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Great. Well, I can definitely set you up with that, and you can-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-um, try to tackle, um, your childcare issue, um, with some assistance. Is there anything else you'd like to do, um, for example, would you be interested in talking with me again, um, just as things progress?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I-I think I would. I mean, it's-it's been nice to just talk about everything that's going on.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So, these are not problems that are going to go away in a week. It's going to take some time to resolve. Okay, great. So, um, it sounds like we have a couple of things, uh, to pursue."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Anything-anything else?"}, {"instruction": "Mm-mm", "input": "", "output": "Would you be interested in perhaps thinking about setting a goal with respect to your drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I mean, I could at least try to going back to one drink a night instead of two.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Try to cut back a bit and see how that goes."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I mean, I-I don't know how it's going to go, especially with trying to cut back on smoking already, but, I mean, I can try.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, you can give it a go and, I think doing managing, you might just learn a little bit about how easy or difficult it's going to be, and-and also what it's like to cope with stress in other ways."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, it sounds like we have two avenues to pursue, anything else?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, that sounds good. So, why don't we meet again in a couple of weeks and you kind of update me on how cutting back on your drinking has gone, and also, what it was like when you met with a social worker? Sound good?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, great. I look forward to talking next time."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Um, so you've talked a bit about like the emphysema. Um, what did the doctors say to you when you were diagnosed? I mean the obvious, right?"}, {"instruction": "Every time I go-- Excuse me. -to any doctor, you know, you need to quit smoking and\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Finger comes out."}, {"instruction": "Uh-huh and I kind of go, let's move on, you know because I've heard the lecture. Um, and I really don't put much credence into what they say. I did have- I did have a neighbor who was smoked for many, many years and, um, she had the Oxygen-- Oxygen tank that she would have to sleep at night with the oxygen on and even that didn't deter me from that smoking.

And I have consistently, uh, almost not even considered myself in the equation. It was, uh, kind of sad in a way, at the time that I realized it.

I could still be a teacher you know, I could show up an I could just do a really poor job and I could go home and I probably could keep my job for a while, it wouldn't be the first time right?", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "But I don't feel good about that.", "input": "", "output": "You don't feel fulfilled."}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Like you've done anything helpful."}, {"instruction": "Right, right.", "input": "", "output": "It's because you showed up and you gave out"}, {"instruction": "It's not enough for me to just show up and get my paycheck.

It was in my top 12.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-uh."}, {"instruction": "But I think the conclusion that I came to is that I can be more creative and have more freedom if I have inner peace and self-respect.

Part of what steals my creativity is when I'm- my mind is reeling around in stress and I am not- I can't even hear myself. I can't even hear myself think.

It's a big test and I've kind of been putting it off just 'cause I get very anxious. I don't trust in myself that I'm going to do good at it. Um, and so that's something that's like always on my mind, it's been on my mind for many years and it's like, I gotta just do it. Um, but I always stop myself from doing that because of the anxiety. And I just want to, I don't want to feel that way.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah.

So, I just avoid it and put it off.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not confident at all, 10 being very confident.

How combat, like, not like a two or three."}, {"instruction": "I mean, because I-I have it set up after like so many years, so I still have a ton of anxiety about it, but I think I'm like kind of making it, maybe that first step. And so that's why I would rate it as like a four or five because I'm making that first step, but it's still scary for me.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Yeah, and you also mentioned that you've actually made the appointment that you have to take this exam."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And before you've been putting it off."}, {"instruction": "Yes. And I already kind of put it off after s-scheduling it too. So, um, now I'm actually enjoying that because I-I already like changed date and everything. So now it's actually coming.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, you've made this appointment before in the past and the anxiety has kind of taken over where you've rescheduled it."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "And this time, it seems like it's a little bit different this time. How come this time you feel like you might not reschedule this time around?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well I think it's this kind of long time coming. I just need to do it and then I can figure out, if I don't pass, I have to wait three more months to do it. And then I just study for the next three months. And if I do, then I can have that weight lifted off my shoulders cause it's been all a lot of weight on me and I think about it every single day.

But then I do worry, you know, that negative talk that, you know, when you have anxiety. So then I worry about if I don't pass it, you know, like people are going to ask me how I did and if I don't pass it I'm gonna have to tell them, it's embarrassing for me.

Have those other feelings that could come up and if you don't have."}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "I'd love to hear from you. When was the time in the past that you were feeling anxious about something and you actually did it and it turned out well?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I would say maybe like four or five years ago, um, I had to do a recording for work and I did not want to do it. I was trying to find every way that I can get out of during this recording. And, um, and then I played my recording and because of the way sometimes I carry myself, like not confident and very anxious, um, I think other people don't always believe in me.", "input": "", "output": "And so, um, when I played the recording, it actually ended up being one of the best recordings and like my supervisor and our national consultant, they were very like shocked about it because it because of just was the way I carried myself. So I thought, I don't really like compliments that makes me, um, anxious too again people compliment me, but it was a nice feeling because I really didn't trust in myself. And to know that I did a good job."}, {"instruction": "And so, um, when I played the recording, it actually ended up being one of the best recordings and like my supervisor and our national consultant, they were very like shocked about it because it because of just was the way I carried myself.

And to know that I did a good job.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Um, it made me feel good.", "input": "", "output": "So, in that experience, it really built up your self-confidence and it almost not only changed the way you saw yourself, but maybe how other people saw you and you really, you liked that feeling."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I did.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. And that must've been really brave for you to do something that seems really daunting at first, yet you were really successful at it."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Um, how do you think you could relate that to what you're dealing with now?"}, {"instruction": "I mean, I think again, like all that anxiety, the same anxiety I had with that I have with those tests. And so, um, but that if I pass this test, if I could have that same feeling that I had, like when I did a good job like the-- you know, I mean, I would like to have that feeling again.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm"}, {"instruction": "You know.", "input": "", "output": "So for you to create opportunities to create those moments that you can have that feeling again"}, {"instruction": "Right", "input": "", "output": "And you just mentioned too, you feel really proud of yourself."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So to end our conversation, how do you think you couldn't move? You originally said, you were at four or five, what would have to happen to get you to like a seven, to feel more confident?"}, {"instruction": "Well, considering this test is coming on the way in a few days, um, I think, for me and just like practicing and just really seeing how I do and if I do well, then I think my confidence might go up a little bit.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm"}, {"instruction": "And maybe just having that faith in myself that, you know, that I can do it instead of just thinking that I can't.", "input": "", "output": "So that positive self-talk could really go a long way for you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.

And you liked the way it means, you see yourself and how others saw you, and it seems like y-you're ready to finish this exam and-and remind yourself that you can be successful?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.

I started about four years ago, but I've been involved in music for about 10 years now, so.", "input": "", "output": "Wow. That's a long time. What other instruments?"}, {"instruction": "I started off on the violin first.", "input": "", "output": "No kidding."}, {"instruction": "So I played that for like six years, once a clarinet, dabbled here and there with different things. And then I found the one- the one for me.", "input": "", "output": "That's awesome. And you play tenor sax?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, the tenor sax.", "input": "", "output": "Wow. And how long have you been in marching band?"}, {"instruction": "Marching band since freshman year. So like three years.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Couple of years. Great.

And putting on this entire show-", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "-it's very exciting, very exhilarating once you're in competition.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "It's very cool.", "input": "", "output": "Cool. And do you have a lot of friends who are in band with you or-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-friends outside of band or?"}, {"instruction": "I have, um, you know, I have two-two separate groups. I have my friends from class and then my friends from bra-- from band.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "So.", "input": "", "output": "Great. And then, um, tell me a little bit about your family?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, well I have one brother he's older than me, about nine years older than me.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, wow."}, {"instruction": "And, uh, my parents and my dog.

Uh, we'll go to the movies or we'll most likely we'll just meet up at someone's house-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-and just hang out and things.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. When you're hanging out, is there ever alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes,  I'm gonna be honest sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh So how often do you think you drink alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "Um, depending on how much schoolwork there is When there's not, it might be like every other weekend or like three weekends out of the month or something like that.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, so you're drinking a lot?"}, {"instruction": "A little, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And how much are you drinking on the days that you're-- on the days that you drink?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't, we don't get blackout drunk or anything. It's more of like a little tipsy kind of thing.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I have gotten blackout drunk before-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-but I kind of did that, learned my lesson, didn't like it.", "input": "", "output": "Got it. So you've-you've had some pretty heavy drinking. What-what do you think is the most you've ever had?"}, {"instruction": "Like how many drinks?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Um, it was a good amount. It was the first time I ever drank and it was like three or four cups, but it was mixing different things.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so you don't even know."}, {"instruction": "So, I'm not-- Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, and then your friends drink too?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yes. Not all of them, but some of them do.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And how much do they typically drink?"}, {"instruction": "More or less the same amount. So right now the most we'll have is maybe like one cup after that one time, but sometimes one or two, but they can be kind of heavy.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so it's one cup, but it's not-not one drink."}, {"instruction": "Oh, it's a red, you know, typical. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "It has a lot of alcohol in it."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, so gosh, you're-you're actually really drinking quite a lot. Um, you know, your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "So, is that surprising to you?"}, {"instruction": "A little bit.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Um, so we call it high-risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some bad consequences from drinking like that. So, you know, things like, um, having car accidents, or other accidents, or getting in fights, or, you know, sexual assault, or health problems, or developing alcoholism. Have you thought about those things?"}, {"instruction": "Not too much, to be honest. I-I've always thought since it's, you know, within my small group of friends-", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "-and we usually sleep over each other's house, we don't get into the problems of drinking and driving, and possibly sexual assaults and things like that.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "But I haven't really thought about possible alcoholism or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So it's, um, so it's good, because you're not drinking and driving, but you're still really drinking a lot. Um, and yeah. Okay. So, let's-let's talk a little bit about that, how you might be able to make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "So, um, do you think you could quit drinking or?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think I could. I don't need it. For instance, it-it is-- it is used as a kind of, like, let's get the party going.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "But we haven't always had it-", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "-obviously. So, I think it would be possible to stop drinking.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, does that mean you're gonna stop drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I would probably start off by like, because my friends are also involved, so I'd be like, \"Hey, guys, I don't think I'm gonna drink today.\"", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "And kind of see how that goes. Because\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, you don't sound very much like you think that's gonna work."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's, you know, it's one thing to control my own drinking, and it's another thing when everyone else around me is drinking and then there's like that pressure-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-of, \"Oh, they're gonna think I look stupid.\"", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, how are you gonna quit drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, so I mean, do you think they're really good friends of yours if they're gonna give you such a hard time?"}, {"instruction": "My close ones, I know they wouldn't be, you know, have a problem with that. But the ones that I'm not that close with, but I'll still like hang out with-", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "-those are probably the ones that like might ostracize me for something or.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you might be better off without them though. They\u2019re-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "- maybe not very good friends."}, {"instruction": "Probably, might be too judgmental.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So, um, so I think we should set a goal that you're gonna stop drinking."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "And, um, I think you should probably stop as soon as possible, like this weekend."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Um, so the way this normally works is, you know, we set you a goal, and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple of weeks and make sure that you actually stopped. Um, and so what do you think about that?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I think-- I think the possibility.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So-"}, {"instruction": "I think if you make a good plan, like I think I'd be able to follow through with it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, great. So, the plan is gonna be that you're gonna quit and, um, the friends that you have that you don't think are supportive, you're just gonna, I guess, not hang out with anymore."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I think I can do that.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And then, um, you know, like, are your friends in band drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Um, not-not really. The ones that drink more are the ones like my class friends. My band friends, we\u2019re focused on band-", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "-so I can't really\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, that might be good, is really just to focus more on band. Um, because you know, the other big concern I have for you is if you wanna go to medical school, you're not ever gonna get into medical school if you're drinking like this."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You know, like college is gonna be really hard. And especially with all those pre-med classes, you're not gonna be able to handle it drinking this much. You know, have you thought about that?"}, {"instruction": "Not too much, to be honest.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Okay. So, setting this goal then of quitting drinking is gonna be really helpful for you. And um, it sounds like i-it shouldn't be that tough really, um, especially because you can just stop hanging out with-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-the people who drink a lot, um, since you have some other friends. Um, yeah. So, do you have any questions for me or?"}, {"instruction": "Um, what should I-- uh, yeah, I do. So what should I say like once, let's say, I hang out with my friends and they're like, \"Hey, why aren't you- why aren't you drinking?\"", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Like how should I go about that situation?", "input": "", "output": "Well, you know, one good option would be to just review with them review with them all the bad things about alcohol. You can say, you know, \"I thought about it, and I realized it's gonna mess up my schoolwork. And you know, it's really a lot of risk for my health.\" \"I don't want to become an alcoholic.\" Um, you know, \"I don't want to get liver disease.\", \"I don't want to end up driving drunk or getting into accidents-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-or getting in fights.\" You know, one thing you could bring up is, \"I've heard a lot of stories about kids who you know, are at parties and they're drunk and acting stupid, and then people post stuff on Instagram.\""}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "And you know, that's it for their social life. It's like over."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So\u2014"}, {"instruction": "And-and you know, like professional life as well.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't want that biting me in the butt,  in the back.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So I think just tell your friends you know, you realized there's always bad things about it and you don't want to do it anymore, so you're just not going to."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "And then-"}, {"instruction": "I think I can do that.", "input": "", "output": "-you can tell them to stop too. You know, then that'd be really good. You'd being a good friend."}, {"instruction": "It'd be easier as-- You know, as a group we-we all work together to become better.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. All right. Any other questions or anything else I can help with?"}, {"instruction": "No. I think- I think I'm good.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, like I said, I'll plan to meet with you again in a couple weeks."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "And make sure that you actually quit drinking."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "Sound good.", "input": "", "output": "Great."}, {"instruction": "Fine. Where do you want me to sign?", "input": "", "output": "Well, you can sign right there. Seems like you're not in the mood to talk today."}, {"instruction": "Not really.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. You know it seems like you had uh, a day at school. I noticed that uh, you missed your first hour of class today as well."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, whatever. I just, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "It seems like that doesn't-isn't really a concern for you at this time?"}, {"instruction": "It's just like the same thing every day like, I don't really know why. Like um, so I signed your paper, why are asking me all these questions?", "input": "", "output": "So you're kind of wondering what the point of these visits are, me coming to your house."}, {"instruction": "Yup.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Would it be okay with you if I kind of explained again kind of what this program is about?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so.", "input": "", "output": "You know that I will be stopping by every day just to make sure that you're here and following and-and responding to your GPS and making sure that that's charged up every day and that, um, if you're leaving the house without permission, that we will be aware of that as well. Um, and kinda just to get to know you as well when I come for these visits 'cause, um, you know that's kind of my role as your caseworker is just to-to monitor your day-to-day stuff."}, {"instruction": "So you just wanna know my business?", "input": "", "output": "It does kinda come off as nosy at times I'm sure."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "I know uh, some clients have struggled with understanding that I really do care about you. And you know that when we first met that you had expressed a goal of, um, getting off this program as quickly as possible."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "So I know just kinda being here when you need to be here is one way of doing that."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Yet you still can seem kind of annoyed that this is something that we still have to do."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I mean I guess I'll be here if I have to be but I can't make any promises that I won't leave.", "input": "", "output": "So you're still kinda concerned that you're not quite sure if you will be able to do this successfully?"}, {"instruction": "No, 'cause this just kinda feels like why do you need to know my business? Why do you care?", "input": "", "output": "Um, and-and I'm sure that does seem kind of confusing too 'cause I'm sure you've got a lot of other people involved in your life right now with the courts I'm sure, I know that your mom is concerned about you as well and there's this one other person kinda checking in on you as well."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure it's pretty overwhelming."}, {"instruction": "It's just like a lot.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "And you feel like there's all these rules.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. And there is and I'm sure that it is really struggling at times too."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Um, and I know some clients have expressed just really valuing their freedom. They didn't realize how much they really valued that until it was gone."}, {"instruction": "Right, I think that's the only thing that I wish I had now.", "input": "", "output": "Your freedom?"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "What would be some ways you could go about being able to get your freedom back?"}, {"instruction": "I guess like your sign your papers.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm, yup that's one step, just sign the papers when I come by. Even though it seems like it's kinda annoying at times, it is something that we're contracted to do."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "What are some other ways you feel like you can get your freedom back?"}, {"instruction": "Not do this again so that I don't ever have to be here and be stuck in my house and all of these people coming to visit me and know my business.", "input": "", "output": "So that's something that will motivate you to not do what you did, not commit that crime, and, um, 'cause you do not like when we stop by?"}, {"instruction": "Yup.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay. Well, I know that you are making an effort. I do appreciate then and when-when I do stop by that you still sign the paperwork even though you feel like it's annoying at times. So, thank you for, uh, at least doing that."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, before I leave today is there anything else you'd like to add or-or need to share with me?"}, {"instruction": "Not really.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, well just so you know, again, I do have to come back so I'll see you later today then."}, {"instruction": "All right.", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "Bye.", "input": "", "output": "So, Jacob, everything looks very normal on your physical exam. Do you have any questions for me?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I see that you filled out our, um, alcohol and drug questionnaire. Is it okay if we go through this together?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What we talk about is confidential. I only tell your parents about what we say if you give your permission or if I become worried about a danger to-to you or to someone else. Does that make sense?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, let's take a look. So I see that you have marked that you sometimes use alcohol, and that you have used alcohol to relax, feel better about yourself or fit in. Do you mind telling me a little bit more about your alcohol use?"}, {"instruction": "It's not a big deal. Sometimes with my friends, we'll drink a few beers and when we're hanging out or when we're at a party, and sometimes rum and cokes.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so how many do you usually have at a time?"}, {"instruction": "Um, three or four, probably. I don't keep track.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And how often?"}, {"instruction": "Um, probably about once or twice a month.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, you drink with friends, sort of three or four beers or mixed drinks, one or two times a month. How long have you been doing that?"}, {"instruction": "Probably since last October.", "input": "", "output": "So, for about six months. I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "What do I like about it?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't know. It's just fun to drink with my friends, like when we're at a party at someone else's house, and we're drinking with other people that we don't know. It tastes good.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, it sounds like you feel relaxed and have fun when you're drinking with friends and you like the taste."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I'm also curious, are there any parts about your alcohol use that you don't like?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't like when I get sick in the mornings 'cause of hangovers and-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-when I start throwing up, that's not- I don't like that.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever experienced a-a blackout, like when you've been drinking and you wake up and you don't remember what happened?"}, {"instruction": "No, but that happened to someone I know, though.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And have you had any problems related to-to your drinking alcohol, like at home or school or somewhere else?"}, {"instruction": "Um, one time I missed first period of school 'cause I had a hangover and I was late getting up.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Mm, mom got mad at me 'cause I wouldn't get out of bed and she said she knew I had a hangover.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Have you told your mother that you drink with your friends?"}, {"instruction": "No, but I got grounded for two weeks after that. ", "input": "", "output": "So more negative things about your drinking, like getting into trouble with your mom and missing a class at school when you had a hangover?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I only missed school once.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I see on the questionnaire that you have not ridden in a car with someone who's been drinking and you haven't driven a car, um, after you've been drinking. Is that correct?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "That's great. And I hope you continue to avoid those things. As your doctor, I want you to know that I'm concerned about your drinking. When teens drink, things can go wrong, like injuring yourself. Even when you don't drink too excess, though, your brain is still developing and is very sensitive to the effects of alcohol."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "That's why I recommend that all my adolescent patients not drink at all. So if you were thinking today about how ready you feel to stop drinking alcohol on a scale of zero to ten, with zero not being ready at all and ten feeling very ready, what number would you pick?"}, {"instruction": "Um, probably a five.", "input": "", "output": "A five? So, I'm curious. Why didn't you pick a lower number like a two or three that would mean you're only a little bit ready to stop drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I'm just tired of getting in trouble.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What could you do to avoid getting into trouble?"}, {"instruction": "Um, not drink.", "input": "", "output": " Have you ever tried not drinking or stopping drinking?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What some people your age do is try stopping drinking for a period of time just to see what that feels like."}, {"instruction": "I could probably do that.", "input": "", "output": "So, how long do you think you could go without drinking?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you could go two months without drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, probably.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What things would make it easier for you to not drink?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I could probably drink something else when my friends are drinking, like just coke.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else to make things easier for you?"}, {"instruction": "I can probably hang out with some of my friends who don't drink or inviting them to parties and having fun 'cause not everyone drinks at parties.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Is there anybody in your life that you can talk to about this, who give you some support for not drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. The-- My friends who don't drink would probably be happy that I'm not drinking either and yes, they'd support me.", "input": "", "output": "Great. So you've come up with some reasons to stop drinking, like having hangovers and throwing up and getting into trouble. And you've developed some strategies to-to try to not drink, like spending more time with friends who don't drink or having non-alcoholic drinks when people around you are drinking alcohol. I think that's a great plan. I'm really proud of you for giving this a try. How about if I have you make an appointment for two months from now and then I'll see you back and we can see how things are going?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Hey, Mary, how are you?"}, {"instruction": "Fine.", "input": "", "output": "Um, I noticed some yelling going on in the house, what's going on?"}, {"instruction": "It's not really any of your business.", "input": "", "output": "So nothing you want to talk about right now?"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "My guess is you're probably involved in that."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I understand that sometimes if you're feeling angry or upset about something, the last thing you want to do is share with your caseworker at that time, but, um, you know I am here for you, and if there's anything you ever want to talk about or share with me, that is something that I would love to-to here, and I'll just see sit here and listen if that's something that you would find helpful."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. You know what? I-it seems like things have been really a struggle for you lately, and I have noticed that you haven't been in the best mood, so I'm really- I am concerned about you, but again, it's your choice if that's something that you feel like you want to share with me."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "All right, well, you know I will be by later today. If, um, you have any questions or if you want to talk, um, otherwise, again, I'll stop by and call you later."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "All right, take care, bye."}, {"instruction": "You know that my friends were happy, um, that I'm like this cool person who moved from in the middle of nowhere, has a strange accent that-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-they like all my stories, they are really receptive-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-but they don't know that I have one diabetes story.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "That one I haven't shared yet.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "So, I guess I'll make it short to exactly the incident 'cause I know we can't avoid it now. Uh, yeah, well, that one what happened was I-I was invited to my first party in this crew-", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "-which I was super excited about.", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "But, it was an evening party and we all wore really nice dresses-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-the short ones, the really huggy ones. ", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh. Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "So I actually decided, and I know this wasn't the smartest decision of mine, but I did not wear my insulin pump.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "Which was the reason why I didn't want quite to address 'cause I know better. I-", "input": "", "output": "You probably think that I'm going to get on your case about that or something."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I know, I know, I know.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Like the learning is done but-", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "-but yes I guess it's unavoidable that we address it.

I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy."}, {"instruction": "What? Cutting off some of my friendships?", "input": "", "output": "Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt."}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards.

So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so?"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits."}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-what they want to further their dreams, yeah?"}, {"instruction": "Mm. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so we talked about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep?

Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support you to do that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah.

And how often do you think you drink?"}, {"instruction": "Um, maybe like once or twice a month at the most.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm, so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, and so that's maybe like 20 times a year."}, {"instruction": "Possibly, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess you can say that.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What do you think is the most you've ever had?"}, {"instruction": "Um, just two drinks at a party at the most. I don't-- I don't like to drink a lot. I don't-- Getting drunk is not something that appeals to me. So, I just have, like, a drink in my hand, so my friends won't bug me about not drinking. It's just like to look like I'm actually doing something. Most of- a lot of the time, I don't even drink at all. So-", "input": "", "output": "But you've been drunk before?"}, {"instruction": "Um, no, not really, maybe tipsy, but not like drunk.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, so the most you've ever, ever had is two drinks in a day."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Interesting. So, do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "Um, yeah, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, so one of the things that, you know, is really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving. So, um, you know, that's actually a really big problem. And even around here, we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident. So that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing, all right? Have you ever done that? Have you ever gotten in the car-"}, {"instruction": "No, I have drunk-driven and never got in a car with a drunk driver.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Uh, how much do your friends drink?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I mean, I have some friends that drink some more than others, like, my close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that, but I know that there are people that drink a lot more.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What about at these parties you're going to, are there other kids there who are drinking a lot?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. There are kids that drink a lot more than I do. Definitely, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And do you hang out with them?"}, {"instruction": "Not really closely, like, I know who they are and I'll say hi, but not-- They're not really, like, close friends of mine.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm, so, you know, even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. Did you know that?"}, {"instruction": "Um, yeah. That makes sense.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, so, there, I mean, a lot of the other dangers of drinking, like, um, not just car accidents, but you can have other accidents, you know, people, um, you know, will fall or, um, you know, break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and falling down or, you know, as a girl, it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You know, especially if you've been drinking, then, you know, you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you. Did- have you thought about that?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, I have. That's, uh, one of the main reasons that I don't like to drink that much.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "So-", "input": "", "output": "And then, um, you know, people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too. Um, also, you know, there have been a lot of kids, even at this school, who've gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And then their parents find out or the school finds out and, you know, we have a no-tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol, and really can get you into trouble, and it could put your whole college career in jeopardy.

Definitely, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "But you're still drinking."}, {"instruction": "Um, yeah, I mean, I guess it's the thing to do at a party, so-", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh. So, I mean, do you think it's the thing to do if you wanna be an attorney?"}, {"instruction": "Um, definitely not. That's why I don't try to drink that much. Just-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-make it look like I am, kind of.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Okay. Hmm.

Um, what do you think about that?"}, {"instruction": "I definitely agree. I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol, they are the ones you mentioned, like, health-wise and things like that, so, I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So, do you think you can quit?"}, {"instruction": "Um, yeah, I mean, it's not, like, a really big part of my life, so.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, I'm going to write down then that you've decided to quit."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "And, um, that's gonna be your goal, and that's great, you know, that's really why we're here, is to talk about that and-and make sure that you come to that decision. Um, so, I guess, can you quit this weekend then?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, definitely. I'll just not have a drink.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, and then what about your friends who are still drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I really can't control what they do, but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, and-and what if they won't?"}, {"instruction": "Well, then, I guess, I'll just try to hang around them less or something. I'll try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Probably if your friends won't quit drinking, you should just find new friends."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "'Cause, you know, the problem is if they're drinking, they're gonna pressure you into drinking and then you're gonna feel awkward and, you know, you're gonna be stuck and-and not know what to do and really you'd just be better off probably without them.

Um, let's see. I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking."}, {"instruction": "They would be pretty upset. Yeah. They don't really condone alcohol use.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "So-", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so, yeah, just another reason why you probably need to just quit then. Um, okay, yeah. I-- Okay, so, like I said, I'm gonna right down here that you've decided to quit and, um, uh, you know, I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably in the next semester sometime, so we can kinda check-in and-and make sure that, you know, that's still going well-"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "-and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking.

Um, any questions or anything-"}, {"instruction": "Uh, no.", "input": "", "output": "-like that?"}, {"instruction": "I have no questions.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. You're sure? Okay. All right.

I don't wanna-- I-I used to work out quite a bit, and in the last, I dunno, couple of years I've just-- I stopped going. I got busy, and now I'm out of the habit, and I-I really, I dunno, I feel like I need to get back.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I mean, I think you just need to maybe sit down and write down a list of reasons why you need to get back to the gym, and then on the other side of the list, put down, you know, um, ideas about what's going to help you get there."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Um. All right. Um\u2014", "input": "", "output": "What gym do you belong to?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I belong to the-the Sport Fitness Center.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And-and how far away is it from your house?"}, {"instruction": "Just a couple of miles.", "input": "", "output": "Just a couple of miles. Mm. So you-- you know, you could, like, ride your bike or walk there, and it would be  too."}, {"instruction": "If I walked that far, I probably wouldn't even need to go to the gym, right?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I don't know about that. Um. That-- you know, it's really important that you get your, um, not just your cardiovascular-- that's a good idea for the cardiovascular, but also, you know, your, um, weightlifting, the  "}, {"instruction": " training.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"instruction": "It-it-it would be important.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah.

I think that's the main thing.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Yeah, because your-your health really, to me, it's more important than your-your looks. I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand what you're saying, but, you know, it'd be great to get back in those jeans, but\u2014"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. It-it-it-- I-I am- I'm not getting any younger than I ", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Well, I think you know what to do. You've done it before."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Just a matter-- You just gotta do it."}, {"instruction": "I've gotta make time.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "I've gotta make time.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. And so that might mean, you know, like giving up an hour's sleep, getting up an hour earlier in the day, and going there and getting it done then. That's what I do."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "All right.", "input": "", "output": "So when I see you next time, you know, that's what I'd like you to do is to, uh, experiment with getting up an hour earlier and, um-- You know, 'cause, uh, getting healthier is more important than sleep, you know. I mean, I know sleep is important, but-- And then bring that list back that we talked about."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "All right, so I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Very good. Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "All right. All right. Bye."}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's fine.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks. When I looked at your form, it looks like you use heroin weekly and you injected. What part of your body do you normally inject in?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, mostly in my left arm.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mind if I take a look at your arm, please?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, no. That's okay. How's that?", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, I don't see any redness. Um, can you go ahead and touch that Miguel, and tell me if it feels warm to you or if it hurts?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, nope. It feels okay.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks. Just so you know, when I talk to patients about drug use, my job is to be helpful. I'm not going to tell you what to do or what you should do. What I can do is share some information and be a resource. Does that make sense?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah, that's fine.", "input": "", "output": "Right. What else can you tell me about your heroin use?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I don't know. Um, I use maybe a few times a week.", "input": "", "output": "A couple of times a week. And where do you get your syringes?"}, {"instruction": "Syringes? Uh, sometimes I'll buy them at Walgreens. Most times I'll just get them from the needle exchange.", "input": "", "output": "Uh, what one do you remember?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, Northeast Glisan.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. How often do you use new deals when you inject?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I use new needles every time, I never share.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, it sounds like your health is important to you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's right.", "input": "", "output": "And you showed up today to take care of your migraines."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm, yap.", "input": "", "output": "So, uh, you wrote on here that you've experienced withdrawal symptoms when you've stopped using in the past, is that right?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah. Yeah, if it's, uh, you know, if it's been a couple of days like I can go two days, three days tops before I start to feel really sick.", "input": "", "output": "What does that feel like?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, geez. Yeah, I mean, it's the obvious stuff like my stomach feels sick, I get the body aches, uh, cold, hot, chills. Uh, everything hurts. Everything is in extremes. My emotions are in extremes. Uh, yeah, it sucks. I don't want to do anything. I just want to stay home and just stay in bed.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds awful. What do you do when that happens?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I mean, I start to use, I get loaded.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. How else does injecting heroin impact your life?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, you know, I get loaded and I-I can- I can function. I can go to work and, you know, do normal things, you know. Uh, I mean, there's been maybe just a couple of times where I wasn't feeling all that well, and I, uh, I was late a couple of times to work or it might overslept from the night before or whatever, but it's about it. Uh, I just want to avoid getting sick right now. That's my main priority.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. You want to stay healthy. I'm curious, what do you like about using heroin?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, you know, I like the way it feels. Um, you know what I mean? When I shoot up my anxiety, goes away, my depression goes away. Uh, things that usually make life really difficult, uh, get a lot easier.", "input": "", "output": "And what about your use do you not like?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah. I mean, I think everybody who uses at least has some concern of overdosing on some level. Right? Uh, so that's something I'm concerned about is accidentally overdosing. And, uh, yeah, I mean, I don't want to get an infection in my arm, you know, just the usual things. I have a hard time hitting veins sometimes, and I gotta dig around a little bit and I would get worried about, you know, hitting something that I shouldn't or, you know, getting infections.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So on one hand, using heroin feels like an escape from things you don't want to think about. On the other hand, it puts you at risk for an overdose in infections."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's right.", "input": "", "output": "So weighing what you like and don't like about your use, where do you want to go from here? What do you want to do differently?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Well, some patients who inject heroin are interested in a medication called Suboxone. It reduces cravings, withdrawal symptoms without making you high. Some patients want information on how to inject drugs more safely or where to get new syringes. Other patients want to carry Naloxone which is a drug that can prevent one from overdosing."}, {"instruction": "Uh, are you talking about Narcan? Is that the same thing?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I got some of that already. I got it from the needle exchange.", "input": "", "output": "Where do you keep it?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, at home mostly.", "input": "", "output": "In case you see someone overdosing?"}, {"instruction": "I mean, that's a concern, of course, right? Uh, I'm on the app just in case somebody nearby is OD-ing and I can get pinged. But no, mostly I just keep it in case I overdose, uh, and, uh, I'm realizing now I have it but I haven't told my roommate about it so\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Your housemate may be willing to give you Narcan if they see you overdosing."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else you want to do about your use?"}, {"instruction": "I would really like a little bit of information on, uh, injecting in my arm.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I can email you some information on how to inject in a way that reduces the chance of infection and we also have behavioral health specialists in our clinic who can go over how to reduce harm with you. I bet the syringe exchange has similar resources too."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "So it sounds like you have two goals right now. You want to tell your housemate about where you keep the Narcan in case you overdose and you want some information on how to inject safely?"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "How confident are you to do these two things? On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 meaning not ready at all and 10 meaning very ready, what number would you pick?"}, {"instruction": "I'd probably say 10.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. You're very ready. Why do you think you picked a 10 instead of a lower number like 8?"}, {"instruction": "Well, uh, I don't want to have an overdose and I don't want to get an infection. Seems like easy things to do.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of plan could you put in place to make sure you meet these goals?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, I can talk to my housemate tomorrow night. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't work tomorrow night so he'll be around.", "input": "", "output": "That's great. And how do you want to get the information on injecting?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, if you could email me that right now, that'd be great.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I'd like to hear how your plan worked out for you if you're willing to come back for another appointment. I look forward to hearing about what worked for you and what was challenging say in four weeks."}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah, yeah. It's fine. Let's do that.", "input": "", "output": "Great. I'll see you then."}, {"instruction": "Pretty good.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. What are you really glad about?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home.", "input": "", "output": "I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going?"}, {"instruction": "Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually.", "input": "", "output": "So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. So you've been working really hard-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work."}, {"instruction": "Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "What are you concerned about?"}, {"instruction": "That I'll- that I'll fall again.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself."}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall."}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something-"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home.", "input": "", "output": "And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"instruction": "Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-might have probably helped you break your fall this time."}, {"instruction": "Right, right.", "input": "", "output": "Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that?"}, {"instruction": "She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- \"Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.\""}, {"instruction": "That's a strong word, isn't it, \"betrayed\". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "But, um-", "input": "", "output": "So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home-"}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "-and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Wh-what do you think about that?"}, {"instruction": "Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "-really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know.

What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"instruction": "-if something does happen?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button."}, {"instruction": "I think I saw something like that on TV.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Is it- does it really work?", "input": "", "output": "It does really work."}, {"instruction": "'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- ", "input": "", "output": "Right. Right."}, {"instruction": "It's crazy, it's crazy.", "input": "", "output": "No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-you know, about that happening and-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to?", "input": "", "output": "We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety.

Um, so with your community service I know you've got 25 hours left to do, um, so that does need to get done by the end of your probation, and your case manager is a really great resource to help you find a place where you can do it. So I know in the past some clients have done their community service at food pantries or shelters, or anywhere in the community that's not, you know, a family member or a friend. Um, the urban ecology center is a really great place. You can kind of work outside, work with younger kids. Do any of those options seem like a fit that you might be interested in?"}, {"instruction": "Um, yeah, I just, so I still have to find the community service hours myself?", "input": "", "output": "So that's something that you can work with your case manager on."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "So, um, that's something you can absolutely ask her or quest- or me some questions about, but they'll be able to come and bring you some options-"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "-of places that you can work with, some phone numbers to call."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "And that is something that we'd kinda like to see you do on your own, but if you're really feeling like you're struggling, those are phone calls that either you and I can make together or you and your case manager can make together."}, {"instruction": "Okay, so I would do that. And then do you know, can I get all the 24 hours in in like a weekend or how does that work?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I mean, 24 hours in a weekend sounds to me like it might be a lot of time."}, {"instruction": "", "input": "", "output": "I can- I can hear that you are really eager to just get it finished-"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-and get it out of the way. Maybe I know in the past it's been helpful for some other clients to sit down and take a calendar and just mark out, okay, I'm gonna do five hours this day, I'm gonna do three hours this day, two hours of this day. Does that sound like something that might be helpful for you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think, just to keep track of it better.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I think it's a good idea.", "input": "", "output": "And then, you know, it might be, I definitely think that if you're committed and it's summer break, it's something you could easily get done in a week."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "What other questions do you have for me about community service?"}, {"instruction": "I think that's it. I think I was just worried about who was gonna do it for me, but I know I have to, I guess, do it myself and that 25 hours has to be done. It seems like that's the time I'd have to get done.", "input": "", "output": "Yup, absolutely."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "But you know that if you have any more questions, you can always come to me or your case manager and we're here for- to be a support for you."}, {"instruction": "All right, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome."}, {"instruction": "Definitely.", "input": "", "output": "And do you mind if we talk about a screening form that you filled out earlier today on drug use?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Let's take a look. It says that on occasion you use, uh, drugs other than medical reasons. Which drugs do you use?"}, {"instruction": "I do some meth.", "input": "", "output": "Snort it, smoke it?"}, {"instruction": "Snort it, always snort it.", "input": "", "output": "Don't inject it?"}, {"instruction": "Mm-mm.", "input": "", "output": "Use any other drugs?"}, {"instruction": "Just, you know, some alcohol.", "input": "", "output": "And, uh, um, you do this how often?"}, {"instruction": "Meth?", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Um, two, three times a month.", "input": "", "output": "So you're an occasional meth user. You don't use very often?"}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "Only snort it?"}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. And the amount that you're using it-it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. And that contrasts with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user but it's not in a healthy category because people who use Methamphetamine tend to run to a number of consequences. And actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your Methamphetamine use?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it could be because, uh, I was high when I had unprotected sex and I would not do that if I were not high.", "input": "", "output": "So you're normally very careful and you use protection when you have sex?"}, {"instruction": "Definitely, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And it seems to you that methamphetamine may have clouded your judgment?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else happening with Methamphetamine in your life? Is it affecting you in any way?"}, {"instruction": "No, I mean, no. I mean, like I said, I only do it in clubs, you know, with my friends, uh, two or three times a month at-at the most. Um, uh, I don't think it's really having other impacts. But I'm-I'm concerned about this one. I never expected to get gonorrhea.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, you know, I'm concerned bout it too and I'd actually recommend that you stop using Methamphetamine altogether. And, um, there-there are a lot of reasons for this but that's-that's would be my recommendation."}, {"instruction": "I-I understand but it's I think that would be a hard thing for me to do. You know, I mean, I know I should but, I mean, that's like my whole social life. You know, I mean, all my friends go to these clubs. That's where- that's where I see them. You know, that's my sex life basically and, uh, meth is just- it's just a part of it. You know, I mean, everyone is doing it there. You know, so it's while I would like to stop it's-it's kind of hard to think about doing that right away.", "input": "", "output": "So you recognize Methamphetamine has some problems associated with it and you also on the balance see that a lot of your social life and your sex life involves Methamphetamine, it would be difficult to quit using?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I don't think it would be easy but I'm not saying that I'm not willing to try.", "input": "", "output": "Well, if you were to, um, consider how ready you are to stop using Methamphetamine completely-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-with zero being not ready at all-"}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "-and 10 being ready, where would you put yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, three.", "input": "", "output": "Why not a one or a two?"}, {"instruction": "I mean, this has been really uncomfortable, you know, gonorrhea is a really bad experience. And, uM, I know I don't think the same, you know, when I'm- when I'm on it. And, uh, I mean, what I have is bad enough, I could easily get AIDS. I could get HIV the same way. So that scares me a lot. That's why it's higher than a one or two.", "input": "", "output": "Are there any other concerns that you have about Methamphetamine?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I do just snort it but you don't know what it's cut with, you know, there could be something, you know. It could be really bad, um, if it was cut with something dangerous or something. I mean, I-I worry about that sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Mm, so when I was first talking to you, I thought that you'd have a very, um, really not much interest in not stoping using Methamphetamine but it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really would like to stop using Methamphetamine. And that is, um, that it might be cut with something else, um, you could get another ST- STD including HIV."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Um, what do you think would make it easier for you to cut down or quit using Methamphetamine?"}, {"instruction": "Something else to do on weekends, you know, different social life.", "input": "", "output": "How could you get a different social life?"}, {"instruction": "It's the hard thing, I mean, almost everybody I know uses it.", "input": "", "output": "Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?"}, {"instruction": "My sister.", "input": "", "output": "Does she-- Have you talked to her about your meth use?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't really talked to her about it. I think she knows it I do it sometimes. I mean, we're pretty close. I think I could talk to her about it, and I think she would probably help.", "input": "", "output": "So on the one hand, it would be difficult to quit using Methamphetamine because there are so many positives that you get from using it. But on the other, there are reasons why you want to quit using methamphetamine."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "And there's some things that you might be able to do that would make it easier to not use methamphetamine including talking to your sister and getting some support."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Well, great. I recommend that you not use Methamphetamine at all but what you do is up to you."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "I could see you again in a month.

You know, Palmy often is they're sort of like, \"Oh, you've gotta own a car, and soap it up, and drive up and down the Main Street,\" and I just couldn't give a shit about that, you know, so. Or play rugby and, you know, that didn't interest me at all and sorta come here and have people, you know, talk about interesting stuff and have a good time.

Instead, I like to see if there's anything they would like to do, if anything, about their use. So what can you tell me about your marijuana use?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I vape. I have a pen, but I don't smoke it though.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.

I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going, different behaviors that you might be engaging in, and thinking about any changes you might wanna make for your life if you decide that you do. It's not my job to change you. I couldn't even if I wanted to. That's not my role at all.

That's really exciting to think about that-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-and sort of be looking forward to the future and those things. All right. Well, one thing I'm going to ask you about is, um, you know, different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life. Whether it's, you know, their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies, things like that. So here's the little sheet that goes through just some basic values that, um, might be more or less important to certain people."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Like belonging or sense of community. Again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. So, when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I think a sense of community and belonging.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I think those two and, um, respect.", "input": "", "output": "Respect, okay. Can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, I think community and belonging, I kind of related them. Um, you know how I said I was in the marching band?", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I really, you know, I really enjoy being in that team setting of, you know, being with other people and all working toward- together towards that one goal.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "And then in terms of respect, I-I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules. Like, I-I really do think respect is important, to respect myself and respect those around me, so.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I place great importance in that.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, great. So sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of, um, uh, belonging, like you said."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "And sort of a-a sense of purpose in a way."}, {"instruction": "Yes, purpose.", "input": "", "output": "And then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you. Okay, that's great."}, {"instruction": "Definitely, that's right.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Well, um, one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends. So what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends?"}, {"instruction": "Um, sometimes we just, you know, go to the movies, go to the beach, like I had said, or sometimes we just get together at someone's house, play some good board games and hang out.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm, and when you're hanging out with friends, is there ever alcohol involved?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, well it's mostly just for, for parties or party settings is kind of to get things going and get everything loosened up as they say.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And so when you go to parties, most of the time there's alcohol there?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And how often do you think you would say you're drinking?"}, {"instruction": "I'd say, um, on a not busy month, for instance, I'd say about like two weekends out of the month. Two or three.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not. Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?"}, {"instruction": "The days that we drink are mostly, like I said, they're parties, so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun. And then when we don't, it's a lot more relaxed. It's a lot more hanging out, playing board games, watching a movie it's not yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So it really depends on what the activity is, whether or not alcohol is gonna be there?"}, {"instruction": "Definitely.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus a night you're playing board games?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I think of them as-as different, I think, you know, like in playing board games and things, it's meant to be relaxing.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "So it's nice to have like that kind of breather-", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "-versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's, uh, after it all, it's very draining.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "But in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have fun.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So there's sort of pros and cons on both sides?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "Um, it's, you know, when we drink, we-we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not, you know, everyone's drinking together. We're a lot more loosened up and relaxed-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-and not really thinking about stresses or things like that, but it can be--When it's too much drinking, it can be- can be obviously bad.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So sort of in the-the too much drinking or-or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "Um, a lot of times, it'll make- it'll make people stupid.  Yeah, you know, people make dumb decisions and things like that. We-we usually try to be as safe about it", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-as possible. So we'll like sleep over at a friend's house. And so that, you know, we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group. So we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "But, um, definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stup- when they're drunk and can be really stupid.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So you're trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah", "input": "", "output": "You're trying to stay put, you're not driving. You're trying to stay with people that you trust. Um, but yet it sounds like there's still some-some things happening from time to time."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Can you tell me a little bit about that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I, especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends, like we drink too much and we end up like throwing up or things like that, that I don't- that's not fun.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Throwing up is never fun."}, {"instruction": "It's not.", "input": "", "output": "And how often do you think that happens?"}, {"instruction": "For me, that's happened to me once. It was the first time I ever drunk and it was- it was a lot, I didn't know what I was doing. I was mixing all kinds of weird things and just kind of taking anything everyone- anyone gave me", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-and that didn't end well.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "But after that, I haven't- but I do have friends that still do sometimes, so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "It kind of puts a downer on my- on my fun.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh. Okay. So, on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sorta, um, carefree can kind of let loose a little bit more, on-on the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess, planning involved-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then, um, there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you, that sometimes you're stuck your-your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend who drunk too much. Okay. And the other not so good things about the alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. People can get a little like sloppy, I guess. Like they're all loose, like with people in corners doing things that should be done in private-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-and that kind of stuff.", "input": "", "output": "So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't need to see."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Got it. Okay. Um, all right. Well, you mentioned a couple of times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. Why did you make those decisions?"}, {"instruction": "I just- I've, you know, I have an aunt who is an alcoholic. So I-I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "So, I, you know, I wanna be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like in someone's house or sort of my parents will tell me something. But-- So, I- like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I wanna limit that.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "And so be where I have fun.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Yeah, it sounds kinda similar to your, um, your value of respect to yourself."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "On the one hand, you- the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "If there's too much, then it sort of\u2014"}, {"instruction": "Then it kind of defeats the purpose? ", "input": "", "output": "Right. And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Um, how do you think that the drinking fits in with that?"}, {"instruction": "In terms of what? In terms of respect?", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I think, well in a way, I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things- I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "And then-- But in terms of at- how it is I am respecting myself, I am- I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blackout like throwing up and everything.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "And try to, you know, let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not gonna go somewhere with a person I met-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-into I don't know where to, I don't know what, and-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-things like that.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So you're sort of looking for that balance-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-of how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefits but not cross over."}, {"instruction": "I usually-- Well, I start off like I make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it and how much is in it. So in that way I control how much I drink. So, I usually just, you know, get one of those cups and then make one drink. And then I'll try to make it last as long as possible. And I'll be like, \"All right, this is my one drink\" and I'm good in that way. I still have something in my cup so people aren't gonna be like, \"Oh, here. Have some more.\" I'd be like, \"No, I'm good. I have mine,\" and I'll still be, you know, having some to like let loose a little.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Okay. And do you feel that that's working pretty well for you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or-or what do you think?"}, {"instruction": "For the most part, it works pretty well because, like I said, people, you know, people come asking me, trying to pressure me, I'll be like, \"No, I'm good. I have- You know, I still have something. I'll get some later.\" And I never end up getting anything. Oh, but sometimes they'll be like, \"Hey, let's take a shot,\" and everyone's gathered around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot. And then at that point, I'll be like, \"Oh, well, maybe I can take one more.\" And that's when I start, you know, falling into-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "-way too much.", "input": "", "output": "So, uh, uh, a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you would like-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-would like to make some adjustments-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-to-to make it a little smoother. Okay. So, kind of thinking along those lines, how important is it to you make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I'd like to make sure that I'd, you know, in terms of respecting myself and my body, I'd like to, you know, try to drink less.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Like I-I-- You know, it is nice to let loose and have fun, but I'd also like it to be so, you know, I'm not damaging my body, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "Like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "And, um, you know, have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group, as a- as a community.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh. So kind of combining you alls-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-goals. Okay. So, you-you have a goal it sounds like, of actually cutting back on your drinking. How important is it to you to work on that goal and on a scale of one to ten, where one is not at all important and ten is it's the most important thing right now?"}, {"instruction": "I'd say about like-like a six or a seven.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, okay."}, {"instruction": "I'd like to work on it but, you know, if I get around to it, I get around to it. If I don't, I don't.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh. Why do you say six or seven rather than like a four?"}, {"instruction": "Um, because I still think it's-it's important.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "I still, you know. Like I said, I don't want to hurt my body. Especially going to med school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your-your social and your school work and things like. I know that once I get to college, it's not- it's not gonna-gonna work out being, you know, drinking every weekend and then like trying to wake up early and go to school, take an exam. Like I know that's not- that's not feasible. It's not a good idea.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, looking ahead, you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to-"}, {"instruction": "I think I-", "input": "", "output": "-on that same scale from one to ten?"}, {"instruction": "I think if I made the decision that I was going to, for sure, then I think definitely like a 10 I know it'd be going through.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, wow. Okay. Why do you say 10?"}, {"instruction": "It's just because I know that once I make the decision, I know I can do it. It's making the decision in the first place.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And so you mentioned the- you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down. Um, have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding, you know, dorky or something and be like, hey, you know, let's just stay in today. Like, let's not go out or something. Or just be like, hey, I'm not like-- I'm not going to drink today. And then even if my friends do, like being okay with them, drinking around me and not doing it, and then them being okay with me drinking-- Me not drinking and them doing whatever they want.", "input": "", "output": "So sort of, um, trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. I think it's-it's very feasible. I think it's possible.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, so I guess we'll talk about, um, less alcohol activities. I'm just making some notes to myself and then maybe, um, reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved. Okay. Um, so that-that goal sounds feasible, you said? Would it be okay if we met in a couple of weeks to sort of see how it's going?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. I think that's good.", "input": "", "output": "Does that sound like something you'd like to do?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself, really ambitious goals of going to medical school and, you know, becoming a psychiatrist or, um, some-some other form of physician.

I have an appointment to run to.", "input": "", "output": "All right, thanks. Call me anytime."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I do, just a couple of minutes though.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Well, do you have any specific questions?"}, {"instruction": "Um, nothing specific. I just am unfamiliar with the medication.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, citalopram is an SSRI medication. Its indication is for depression and it's typically dosed as a 20-milligram tablet but it is available as 10, 20, and 40 milligrams.

Uh, what about side effects?", "input": "", "output": "If there are some side effects to this, it can include GI effects, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. But if you have a patient that suffers from any of those things, you can try either decreasing the dose or changing them to a different agent. Do you have any other questions?"}, {"instruction": "Um, what about does it interact with phenelzine?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, that I'm not sure of. Um, can I get back to you later on this afternoon with that answer?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, sure.", "input": "", "output": "Fantastic. Thank you."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "So, you've got this dream by the sounds of it, which is, you know, to have a partner, and a house, and a nice car-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-so don't forget the nice car, and some kids, and be a- be a good dad-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-to your kids.

So, what-what would interest you about going down that same, sort of, path?"}, {"instruction": "Just learn more about cars and just, kind of, hands-on job.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Yeah, so what in particular? Like, if you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?"}, {"instruction": " Mechanic, or panel , or just-- I wouldn't care, I just-- as long as it's cars.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So, as long as it has to do with cars, you'd be sweet with that?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, pretty much.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So-so what sort of things do you think you need to do to go down that path to get that qualification?"}, {"instruction": "Just I have to get that training, I guess, and then probably get a job.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, what sort of training did you-- did these people, that you've been talking about, what did they do?"}, {"instruction": "Like, sort of, um, just at the polytech. I don't know what exactly it was, but\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "It took them like-- And, it took them like a year or something, and then they went into apprenticeship.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So, how confident are you that you could do something similar to these-these friends that you've got?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I could do it pretty easy. It's just, like, I probably know all this stuff already.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, it would be pretty easy. So, if it's pretty easy, what do you need to do next, Billy?"}, {"instruction": "Like, well, I went out and picked some forms and stuff, but it's real confusing, like, having to apply, so I-I just couldn't-- I don't know. I couldn't do it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, you actually went to the polytech\u2014"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-and picked up some forms?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. Passed around and everything.", "input": "", "output": "Wow."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "That's fantastic, Billy."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I just-- Like, they wouldn't help me out, so-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "-I got some forms and-", "input": "", "output": "Tell me- tell me what happened when you say they-- like it didn't help you? What-what-what happened?"}, {"instruction": "I asked- I asked them what I had to do, and they said I had to fill out some forms, but-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "-well, the forms, it's too confusing.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, they gave you a horde of forms for a particular course?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. Well, I got one- I got one for panel , and one for, uh, uh, like, panel and paint-", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "-so, learning how to paint cars and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, you got the forms, took them- took them home?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I was gonna fill them out there, but then I didn't get them, so I took them home, but I was gonna get Donna to help me, but I just didn't get around to it.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. You said the forms were confusing?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah? What-what's the confusing bit?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't understand, like, what you're supposed to write down. Like, yeah. I'm not good at this, maybe too confusing.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So, when you've had to write things or fill out forms before, how-how's that been for you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't really deal with it. I s-- I don't really like writing.", "input": "", "output": "You don't like writing?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So, wondering what that's about, about not actually liking writing."}, {"instruction": "No, I'm just real messy, so people can't read it.", "input": "", "output": "People can't read-- People can't read your handwriting?"}, {"instruction": " Yeah, no. It's what they say, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, you must be a doctor."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I am. ", "input": "", "output": "Yeah?  Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, you need some help to fill out the forms?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Like, a computer or something. If you could write on a computer, I could do that.", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "But, we don't have a computer.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. All right, so what-what do you need to do, Billy, to actually get to that point where you can fill out a form and post it off?"}, {"instruction": "Just ask to get someone else to do it I guess. I guess I could ask Donna, but it's been embarrassing.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so you feel like it would be embarrassing to ask Donna to give you some help-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-because you feel that she might find out something about you that you're not quite sure you want her to find out?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know if it's that serious, it's just-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "-I'm sure most people can fill them out. I don't know, I just don't get it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So, who else could you ask to help you?"}, {"instruction": "No one. I guess you. You could do it. Would you do it?", "input": "", "output": "Well, have you got the forms with you?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I'm wondering about-- because it sounds like this whole idea about filling out the forms, is getting in the way of this bigger dream that you've got which is around getting a qualification around something to do with cars-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-and getting on this road where you're staying out of trouble because you've got this, um, interest-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-which you can do. So, it seems a real shame that the forms are gonna get in the way, so we need to find a way around the forms."}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah? So, what do you think, between now and next week, you can do around the forms?"}, {"instruction": "I guess, I'd go pick them up and I don't know, I guess I could ask Donna, but she'd probably help me, I don't really want to.", "input": "", "output": "She'd probably help you, but you don't really want to. It sounds like you're a bit embarrassed."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. Plus, well, I don't know if I could bother getting up at nine o'clock every morning and having to go to Polytec. I've got used to sleeping in.", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "At night.", "input": "", "output": "So, the whole thing about going back to poly-- going back to school-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-going back to polytech is-- would-would require a really big change in the way which you're currently living, and you're not quite sure if you can do that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Uh, it would be cool if it's anything like school. Like, I didn't really enjoy school.  so writing and stuff, and I wouldn't wanna do that. If it's all hands-on though, it would be all good.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So, there's something here about your level of-- about how confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds like it's getting in the way."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. No, it does get in the way. I just don't wanna do it.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. Okay."}, {"instruction": "It's a waste of time.", "input": "", "output": "All right. So, it sounds like we might need to have some more conversation around that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, what's really getting in the way?"}, {"instruction": "For what?", "input": "", "output": "Well, this writing business. What's really getting in the way?"}, {"instruction": "Of what? Well, I don't get it.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm wondering, like-- it sounds like it's a thing that you're putting up as saying you can't do-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I can't.", "input": "", "output": "-so I'm wondering where you are around your writing and you're reading?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, it's pretty , but, like, still-- I don't know, I'm not retarded, or anything. I can write and read.", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Well, I have to say, I think it's really obvious that you're not retarded."}, {"instruction": "Like--", "input": "", "output": ""}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, we are having a really good conversation here."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, reading and writing is not a strong point for you."}, {"instruction": "No, not really. Yeah, I don't really enjoy it.", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, how much reading and writing is involved in the course that you're gonna go on?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Hopefully, not many-- not much, but that's what I wanna find out, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "So, what'd it be like if you were more confident in your reading and writing? What'd that be like?"}, {"instruction": "It'd make everything easier.", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "Like-- I don't really like reading books or anything, so I don't really care about that but just, say, real-life stuff like going to the bank, and stuff like that-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-yeah, that have filling out forms.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And, I guess that there will be manuals and stuff like that on-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-your course that, you know, to-- the hands-on stuff, it sounds like you're really confident around doing, but it's the more reading, writing, book, kind of, stuff that you are not so--"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I didn't think about that.", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that'd suck if you had to read, like, a big manual or something. Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. Okay. So- so like before you get to here where you got this dream and there's some things that need to happen before that."}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So, mm, we need to think about what's the very first step."}, {"instruction": "Right. Actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. Usually, as, you know, I'm, um, I'm an honor student. I-I usually I'm studying over the weekend and my parents don't let me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage, to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. And when I- when I got there, like I'm not used to this like party environment where everything you see in the movies is kind of what happens, where you have people just drinking out of the bottle-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-or playing random games with alcohol, just to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and like conform to what everyone else was doing. So I wouldn't be- I wouldn't be ostracized.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, you know, I get it. Like, we've all been there. Okay. You know, I was in high school ones too, you know, I drank too. I get it. There's not a ton to do in this town a-and kids drink, but, you know, promise we have these rules-"}, {"instruction": "I understand.", "input": "", "output": "-and you're on a team, you have to stick by the rules."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Um, I know that it's bad for me. It's-it's bad for my body. It's bad for-for-for-for being on the team, for being an athlete. It hinders my performance. Just, I don't know. I-I feel that my-my friends pressure me. I don't know. I feel I should like go with different friend groups. Maybe. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, like being in a sports team, y-you feel very, you have to like be unified with the group.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, but you're one of the leaders."}, {"instruction": "Right. And as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be-- I expect them to lead not only in the sports but also in social environments. And if that's a social- that's a social custom in our society. So it's like\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Well, maybe you can start leading as a non-drinker then."}, {"instruction": "I could, but that could also backfire on me. I feel that I could be ridiculed for being, having a stick up my butt, you know.", "input": "", "output": "You're a star player, who's going to pick on you?"}, {"instruction": "I mean, it's just one-- I'm just one person against the voice of the mob.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Well, yeah. So the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking. I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. You know, there-there are rules at this school and in my job, I have to enforce them. So, you know, like I said, I get it, you know-"}, {"instruction": "I understand.", "input": "", "output": "-I'm not saying I know what it's like. I-I get that you want to have fun in your teenage years. I get that. But, you know, you are a star player, we want to keep you on the team. You know, we got to figure out a way to get through this."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'll dedicate the time, not to party and night. Well, not-not-not party, but, you know, get involved with alcohol to that extent. And like, have it publicized on the internet.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Like on Facebook, all the pictures that you saw on the internet. Like I w- I will avoid those situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually drink alcohol and allow what I do in my own private time to put on the internet so others can see, even though.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Yeah. I mean, we got to have a deal here if you're going to be on the team. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Right. I'll stop.", "input": "", "output": "All right.

So it's not something you wanna rely on, you don't see yourself continuing to use this. It's something that you'v found at least for the moment very helpful?"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm. Yeah, and\u2014", "input": "", "output": "But it's not something that you wanna make a habit of becoming reliant on, or dependent?"}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, okay. Um, and-and so that's a lot going on right now for you? Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it is.", "input": "", "output": "You've been managing in the best way you can. You also have some doubts about it too, it sounds like?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, I don't really know too much about it, other than it makes me feel good.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so for now you know that it makes you feel good."}, {"instruction": "I'm doing all right.

Yeah, because I really value physical and mental health, um, spiritual, emotional. Everything as a whole package, I guess, health.

This time I put it at number two.", "input": "", "output": "Inner harmony is number two?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's just funny how it came out that it wasn't in the top 12.

It's not a selfish thing to put myself first. And, uh, that's something I've always tried to do, make other people happy, please other people, and-and also put myself second, third, fourth, or whatever it is. And I always thought, \"Well, that's the way a good person should be.They should always put other people first, you know. And then there's times for that, you know. There's something going on, and you wanna go out of your way to help people, and you say, \"Well, my needs aren't so important right now.\" I think that is okay to do once in a while.

Um, then, and but also service, that's third because I really do enjoy helping other people. Being there for other people, you know, and-and if it puts myself out.

They're really-- They have me doing some leg things that-that-that is it really necessary?", "input": "", "output": "Well, you know, I-I understand that pain is hard to work through but a lot of time when you're having rehab after a stroke, that pain is telling you that your muscles and joints are starting to work again. So you can kind of think of it as a positive way to, you know, know that your-your body's getting back to normal."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "But what are your goals for the long term?"}, {"instruction": "I wanna go home.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, of course, of course. And what are the things that you'd like to be able to do once you get home?"}, {"instruction": "Everything. I wanna- I wanna, play with my dog. I miss my dog. I wanna cook for myself. I'm a very independent person and I wanna do things for myself.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah. And so that's a very important goal to be able to get back home, to be able to get back to your independence. Have you thought about what it might take to get there?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I guess the rehab.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're absolutely right. And it's also going to be very important that once you're home, you're able to continue on a regular activity program. Have you thought about what that might look like?"}, {"instruction": "Not really.", "input": "", "output": "Not really, okay. Well, have you ever heard of something called Tai Chi? Is that a familiar term to you?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You've heard of it?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I have.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I have a friend who, uh, does it and she just raves about it. She loves it.", "input": "", "output": "Well, you know, Tai Chi is one of the best ways to get your balance back after you've had something like a stroke.

Is that something you think you might be able to try sometime?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I-I hadn't really thought about it, but yeah I guess, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Like I said, my friend talks about it and-and it's very pretty. I've seen pictures, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's not that easy to get started. You do certainly have to have some motivation to want to do it. Um, and when you first start, oftentimes you do feel a little wobbly or a little insecure."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't see how I could do it. I-I'm still in a walker, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah, I understand. So there are lots of places around that have it. Your local senior center would have it. And what I recommend is that you start by doing it in a chair. Just sitting in the chair."}, {"instruction": "I could?", "input": "", "output": "You could. You can talk to the instructor and that way you won't fall, you'll feel confident and you'll start to learn some of the moves. And then gradually over time, as you get a little bit better at doing the moves in a chair, you can start to stand up, use the chair to lean on, and then eventually, you'll be able to get to the point where you can do it on your own."}, {"instruction": "And you really recommend this?", "input": "", "output": "You know, it cuts your risk of falls in half. It also helps to reduce pain although that's not a short-term benefit, you do have to stick with it for at least three to six months to start have it help reduce your pain. But it does have a number of things that I think would get you to your goals of being home and able to play with your dog and doing your own cooking and things like that."}, {"instruction": "You do Tai Chi?", "input": "", "output": "I do Tai Chi. I do it three days a week and it's really helped my balance as well."}, {"instruction": "Oh, okay. Well, yeah. Um, listen, anything that's going to get me home and if you do it and you recommend it, I'll try it.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Well, I'm delighted. It's a pleasure to see you again.

I noticed that she's been in the emergency room five times in the last year for her asthma. What's that- what's that been like for you?"}, {"instruction": "It's been- it's been really difficult. Um, I hate to see her gasping for breath. And, um, I'm really worried, you know, when she has to go. Uh, so that's been-- it's really difficult when I have to take her.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, it sounds like you'd be willing to do whatever you can to try to prevent that from happening."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I-I also noticed that, uh, it's been about three months or so since you picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Are you having some difficulties with that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I did research on the chronic inhaler and I found out that there were steroids in it and that-that I don't want her taking steroids. I did, uh, research on some of the potential side effects and some of the health problems that can result from taking steroids and I-I just don't want her to take those at all. I don't want her exposed to them at all. And then, uh, let me just go ahead and lay this out right now. Uh, because I'm sure it'll come up, but I-I do smoke. But I make sure that I do not smoke around her so that I make sure that it does not affect her. So-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "-I just want to let you know that right off.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it sounds like you care about Sarah a great deal. You-you don't want her, uh, using steroids. You're worried about what kind of effects those would have on her and you're- you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so it doesn't affect her asthma."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Uh, would you mind if we talked a little bit about the chronic inhaler and the medicine that you're concerned about with, you know, the steroids because, you know, I certainly don't want her using a medicine that has steroids in it, like the ones that you're worried about for athletes. Uh, can we talk about that just a little bit?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Even though, uh, even though this medicine isn't the-the medicine that's in this is in the same broad family as the steroids you're worried about, and those are called anabolic steroids."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Which build people up and have masculinizing effects."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "If-if I can draw an analogy-- Again, even though this medicine is in the same family as those big broad-broad family. If I could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same family of fruits, you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than a watermelon. And if you eat one grape, you'd be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very sick. If we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad family, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very small. Uh, and not only that it's not an anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. And what this drug does is actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the body. It only goes to her lungs. And as I said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those anabolic steroids. This is really safe for your daughter to use. So what-what are your thoughts about considering having her using this?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I-I guess I didn't realize that they weren't the same thing as the anabolic steroids.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Which are the ones that cause all the problems and everything. So, um, if-if you can assure me that it's not going to have those same side effects and health problems-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, def-definitely would not. I mean, probably you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, \"uh-oh.\""}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You know. And so-- yeah, and that- and that does concern people. But I do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs, and won't get in her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're worried about."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mind if I talk to you a little bit about what your daughter's lungs are like when she's having these inflammations and needing to go to the emergency room?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. When-when somebody has asthma, their lungs are like hypersensitive. If I could use an analogy, again, if-if you had the skin burnt off your arm, if somebody brushed up against you before he had the skin burned off your arm, it wouldn't bother you at all. But when the skin's burned off your arm, you literally react to it. Her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. Uh, and like the skin on your arm would be if the skin got burned off. And what this drug can do? This chronic inhaler is reduce the inflammation in her lungs so that her lungs don't remain exquisitely sensitive. Because otherwise, everything in the air like dust, pollen, uh, reacts with her, uh, in ways that it would not normally affect us."}, {"instruction": "Oh, okay.", "input": "", "output": "And so this chronic inhaler can really prevent that from happening. Okay? Which is why it's so important to use it."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "The other thing I was going to tell you is that, unfortunately, uh, even though you are smoking outside and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes, because her lungs are so sensitive, can also affect her lungs and cause her to have a reaction. Now, something I'd like you to think about is that, if you use the chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she still maybe because her lungs are just very different than ours. Um, honestly, I'd love to see you quit smoking for you too because, you know, as you know, it's not real good for you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Uh, and it would certainly help her. Um, but what I'd like you to do is to, kind of, keep an eye on what happens when she uses the chronic inhaler. And if she's still flaring up when you're around her, if there are any, if there is smoke on your clothes because it-it can flare her up."}, {"instruction": "Oh, even when it's just on my clothes?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Yeah."}, {"instruction": "She's that sensitive. If I realized that\u2014", "input": "", "output": "It-it-it-- Yeah. It may not- it may not when she uses the chronic inhaler, uh, but you'll need to keep an eye on that. Obviously, it would be- what would be best if it didn't get on your clothes, or you quit smoking."}, {"instruction": "Right. Um, so would it help, um-- You know, the thought of quitting smoking is a pretty daunting aspect.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I mean, I know people who've tried to quit and it's-it's just it's- it's really difficult, you know. So I know, it'd be better\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Very hard. It's very relaxing, and-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And-and it's hard to replace it with something."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it is. Um.", "input": "", "output": "So, uh, any thoughts on what you may be able to do to-to help at this point, if you don't choose to quit right away?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I was thinking, um, if since it, you know, it affects her that it's on my clothes, if I only smoked while she was at school, and then changed my clothes before she came home. Would that help?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, that-that sounds like it would be great if you were able to do that. Obviously, don't smoke in the house, you know- you know."}, {"instruction": "Oh, absolutely. I never. Never.", "input": "", "output": "Um, so yeah. If you're willing to do that, that certainly would help."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Uh, again, if you get to the point sometime down the road where you're willing to quit for both you and her, uh, we'd be glad to help you do that. Because you're right it is- it's not an easy thing to do."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. ", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "It's really difficult.", "input": "", "output": "So it sounds like right now where we are, is you're willing to-to have her use the chronic inhaler-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-to try to get the inflammation down, so she doesn't need to go to the emergency room and do whatever you can at this point to keep the smoke off your clothes. And I think you're gonna see big changes in terms of, uh, her not needing to go to the emergency room, and you probably won't need to use the rescue inhaler hardly at all."}, {"instruction": "Oh, really?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, because you'll get that inflammation down."}, {"instruction": "Oh, that's great-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "-because that's always scary when she has to use that one.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So we'll go ahead and get both of those prescriptions ready."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Use the chronic inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around if she needs it.

Good."}, {"instruction": "Something clicked, I'd had a bunch to drink and, uh, and I knew I'd messed up. I totally messed up.", "input": "", "output": "How did you know you messed up?"}, {"instruction": "Because I was- because I was right there, man. I was right there in the same place when I'd come home and I'd pop a couple of those pills, it was the same deal, like and I wanted to stay there. I wanted to stay exactly right there. And I just felt like I'd ruined everything. You know, Erin's using the phone now, and he called me the next day and it was, uh, great, but I kinda felt ashamed of myself, and I don't want to feel that way again.", "input": "", "output": "Was it that something happened, um, where you put something that was really important to you at risk? Is that what that was about, um, when you say you felt guilty, uh, you felt bad talking to Erin on the phone?"}, {"instruction": "Because of what-- Yeah, I guess, I think that's what I mean, yeah, yeah. Because you know, I mean- I mean I could have stayed, I could have got, I could have got absolutely hammered and I could have done it every night for the rest of the week.", "input": "", "output": "So you saw yourself putting something that was important to you at risk."}, {"instruction": "But I don't know if I stopped because I knew I had to stop or because, you know, it was like right there, that's where I wanted to stay, you know? Anyway, I just, uh-- .", "input": "", "output": "Here you are actually, three months on, three long months as you say, um, and things have been going really well, Uh, you even get a bit of\u2014"}, {"instruction": "They're better, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Well, and then you get the kind of, I don't know if it felt like a green light or a yellow, it went from red to cautionary, you could see your kids, and that was something that was really what you were working for."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Jean, it's good to see you again."}, {"instruction": "Hello, doctor.", "input": "", "output": "So, what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I did what we discussed. I did the journal-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "-for a week, uh, trying to mark down the-the difference in my smoking, being more aware when I had the urge, if I could stop the urge-", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "-and I found it was okay. It got a little bit scary on the weekend because, uh, uh, the urge has kept on coming-", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "-to have a cigarette.", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "But during the week, I was able to cut down at least two or three cigarettes a week, and that's just in one week. So-", "input": "", "output": "So, you've been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes? That's amazing. I mean, given how much you were smoking."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, you were able to keep the, uh, the journal?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "You-- Sounds like you did that, and that allowed you to really focus on the time  delaying your cigarettes. So-so that's gone well. So, what are the things that are not going as well as you'd liked?"}, {"instruction": "It just seemed to get worse when it was the weekend-", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "-and I was going out with friends and I was home a lot of the day-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "-instead of at work. And I found that, um, it was really hard to stop those urges.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, these automatic cigarettes, when you're socializing and you're-- you have time on your hands, really, are the problems that you're facing-"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "-uh, and that you've noticed are more difficult than the others?"}, {"instruction": "But I marked it in the book. Uh, that's one thing I said to myself, I'll be honest in my marking down.", "input": "", "output": "In marking it down, okay."}, {"instruction": "So, I'm gonna have to really be aware of the weekends. Maybe get some kind of hobby or-or join some group or something on the weekends to keep me busy.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.

So, from now to the next time you come back and see me, what is it that you'd like to-to work on?"}, {"instruction": "I think I'd just like to do what I did this first week. I liked the idea of marking it down.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so you can continue with that."}, {"instruction": "I-- And it took me a week and I'm down two cigarettes a day, I-I figure.", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "What I'd like to do is maybe go down to five cigarettes, in other words, another three a day.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "And, um, 'cause I smoke a large pack and small pack, maybe just two small packs.", "input": "", "output": "You said five cigarettes this time."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "And any thoughts about what concretely you could do to make that happen?"}, {"instruction": "I can try each day to count.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "And I'm still gonna try that when I get the urge to let it go, fight it, and maybe not go out for a cigarette until the next urge comes.", "input": "", "output": "Right.

I don't know how to get there and I hate needles.", "input": "", "output": "Mm.

I can't guarantee because it depends on my schedule, but we can brainstorm about ideas on who can go with you to support you so you feel better about attending."}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So we're working on a 10 point of scale 1 to 10, 1 being not important, 10 being very important. One being not confident, one being very confident. So on a scale of 1 to 10, which number best reflects how important it is to you to drink the-- what risk limits?"}, {"instruction": "I would say an eight.", "input": "", "output": "You'd say an eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels?"}, {"instruction": "I would say a four.", "input": "", "output": "Amount of four."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And so let's look at those two. You're-you're thinking it's pretty important, but your confidence is down here, uh, a four, but it's not a one. What makes you confident that you can drink below risk levels and you remember what those are?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I think it's because you've told me I'm at risk and I have alcoholism in my family and I really don't want to go down that path. So I'm-I'm confident that I can change that at this point.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So that gives you a good reason not to drink. Okay. Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, I have a group of friends that doesn't drink that I hang out with. And I think when I hang out with them, it's not an issue. So that also helps me.", "input": "", "output": "So you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink below risk levels?"}, {"instruction": "Yep.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "Nope.", "input": "", "output": "Now let's look at your self-evaluation of your birth control. So now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control. So on a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "I would say an eight.", "input": "", "output": "An eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you- that you can use effective birth control?"}, {"instruction": "Every time,-", "input": "", "output": "Every time."}, {"instruction": "-probably a six.", "input": "", "output": "Correctly as it's prescribed."}, {"instruction": "Probably a six.", "input": "", "output": "Probably a six. Okay. So you're pretty confident that you can do it. And why are you a six and not a two or three?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I'm a six because I think if I drink less, I'll be more reliable with using birth control. I tend to not use it when I'm-- I drank too much and I don't really care too much.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So it's kind of linked to your drinking, the fact that, um, that you can-- if you can take care of that drinking, you can take care of the-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-birth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why you're not down here."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Very good. So it looks like, um, you're using a good method of birth control, you're just not able to use it effectively. And you've linked it back here to the drinking.

Been up in Christchurch how long?"}, {"instruction": "I've been up here since I was 18.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, so you've been here a while?"}, {"instruction": "Just a little while. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Oh good. You got family out here?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, just my own.", "input": "", "output": "Just your own wh\u0101nau here. . Well, Rick, I'm sort of, uh, interested in that, you know, you and I are gonna been doing some work together for a while. I'm sort of wondering what sort of thoughts you'd be having on your way here today."}, {"instruction": "Um, I was thinking about what you might ask me, what I would say. I'm thinking about my kids, thinking about having to take a day off work.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "It's a bit of a bitch.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I see you've had a bit of experience with, uh, coming to prevention services."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "What's that been like for you in the past?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, it's been okay. Um, it hasn't been bad.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Kind of nothing, really.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Similar sort of offending in the past that's brought you back again this time?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "One of the, um, things that I've learned over the years, Rick, is that a lot of guys get to the doors out there and don't come inside and, um, you've come inside. What does that tell me about you?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I hope that it says that I want to, um, make some changes.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "So is that different from when you've come in here before?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And I still had to walk through those doors so-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "-but, um, I just think about my kids, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So they're really important to you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. And do you have your kids with you full-time or-"}, {"instruction": "No. No, I don't. I see them, um, once a fortnight.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And what's it like for you?"}, {"instruction": "It sucks.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "What would you really like to happen in terms of, uh, you and your children?"}, {"instruction": "I just-- I'd love to be able to see them whenever I can, whenever I wanted to.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "You know. I, um, they're my whole world and-and I've fucked things up.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "So, you know.", "input": "", "output": "So coming along to see me and you and I are doing some work together, then you're going on to do a program, how important is that gonna be for you and your children?"}, {"instruction": "It's really important.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. If I was to put it on a scale of say 1 to 100, 1 being not really important, 100 being really, really important, whereabouts on that scale would you you be?"}, {"instruction": "It's, uh, um, it's hard because-because I'm, uh, I'm not a bad person. I've just done some stupid shit, but I'm not a bad person.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "In-in regards to my kids, I'd be100- 100%.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "If it means say, I can have my-- see my kids whenever I- whenever I want.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. What do you think it'd be like for your kids if they were sitting here now and they heard you say that this was really, really important to you and to them? That you gave this program 100%. Well, then what might that be like for them to hear that?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I-I-I'd hope that they'd be proud of me. I wouldn't want my kids to see me- to see me here though. But I- But I hope they would be proud of me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "'Cause I'm-- Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Anybody else in your family that would be really proud of-- that you're taking these steps?"}, {"instruction": "Um, oh, my mom.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Your is mum still down south?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Does she know that you're here today?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "So how might it be for her if she knew that you're talking like this today? That-- 'Cause it sounds to me like you're really serious this time making some changes."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I am.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "I just, um, I don't- don't know where to s-- where to start. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "So do you think doing this program and completing this program this time would be a good place to start?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I hope so. I-- So I would genuinely want to, I genuinely want to do something to help myself. I don't deliberately fuck things up for myself.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So you and I are going to be doing a little bit of work together then. And, um, and sometimes it-it can get quite tough. And I'm just wondering before we go any further, when the going gets tough, a lot of guys bail out. I'm just wondering are you one of those guys?"}, {"instruction": "No, this is important to me.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "I have, um, I've-- it's important to me.", "input": "", "output": "Good. One of the other things we're really conscious of with is, um, sometimes we do this work in isolation from others. And one of the things we want to ask people is about who they're going to be accountable to. I'm thinking like with your children, uh, your mom and other people that maybe you're interacting with. Who-who else in your life do you think would be supportive of you, and who would you need to let them know that you're actually going through this sort of program?"}, {"instruction": "I, um, I'm separated at the moment from my missus and-", "input": "", "output": "What was-- what was your partner's name?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, Kirsty.", "input": "", "output": "Kristy."}, {"instruction": "I would- I would love f-f-for her to know that I'm doing this and for her to know that I mean it, but, um, I know she wouldn't give a shit right now actually.", "input": "", "output": "Right. In terms of your employer, would they be supportive?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah, I don't know. Maybe, but I don't know if I want them to know though.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What do you think it might be like for you to explore that with them?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Any other family members that, uh, live close that, uh, you think would be supportive?"}, {"instruction": "I'm pretty much by myself up here.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. The reason why I'm asking this, Rick, is just, um, you know, part of, um, uh, being responsible is turning up and doing the program."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "The other aspect of that is kind of like who we're going to be accountable to while we're doing the program. So one of the- one of the challenges, one of the riddle I'm going to put in front of you is like who else can we get involved to support you while you're going through this?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't know. I don't, um, have that many people-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "-that I am-- I don't have that many people I trust to support me. My mates, I love them but, um, yeah, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So as we're gonna do this work together and go through this, uh, this program, one of the things we-we don't want to do is fall into the same trough we did last time. So I-I just want to leave that with you to think about next time we come together. There may be two or three other people that you think of that can be really supportive, that we-we need to let know that you're  each gonna make these changes and this time, you're serious about it. So let your mother and, uh, and, um, your partner, how might that happen? How does that sound to you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, let's give it some thought.", "input": "", "output": "Rick, I get a sense that you're kind of padding this walk a little bit on your own at the moment. Would that be true?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. That'll definitely be true.", "input": "", "output": "Your family is down south. I mean,who-who-who else do you think would be really interested in sup-supporting you, rowing with you if you like on this journey?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I have a good relationship with my mum,-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "-with my brothers and sisters.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "My mum is actually pretty important to me.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. How would it be for your mum, do you think, if you were to tell her that this is something that you're-- is really important for you and that you know that this time you really need to do this for her and for the family? What-what might that be like for her to hear?"}, {"instruction": "I think she'd be proud of me.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. All right."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Brothers and sisters, that, uh, would also be very supportive if you were to make this journey?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah. A good, uh, good family.", "input": "", "output": "Good. So how would you go about getting them to support you, to come on board, and be accountable to doing this work together?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't know. Um, have some-somebody just to listen.", "input": "", "output": "And, um, I\u2019m just trying to imagine what do you think your mom would want to say to you if she was sitting here with us now and she heard you talking about this?"}, {"instruction": "She would- she would tell me that she loves me. She would tell me that she believes that I could do it.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. What do you think she might want for you, like upon her for your children?"}, {"instruction": "For them to have a father they can look up to.", "input": "", "output": "I\u2019m getting a strong sense that's what you want as well."}, {"instruction": "It is what I want. Definitely.", "input": "", "output": "So, in terms of having the confidence to do this with the support of your wh\u0101nau and ours, where do you think your confidence level might be now?"}, {"instruction": "If I had their support of my-my family and  I want to say that would be higher. I just know I fucked it up in the past. If they were there to support me now, then I\u2019d be 99% sure.", "input": "", "output": "That's a huge move up the scale, isn't it? So getting your family on board, getting your wh\u0101nau on board is going to be really important for us."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Hi Billy. How are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm all right.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Hey, it's good to see you here and good to see you here on time. Yeah, it's really good to see a good start to the-- to your probation time with us here is to see you being here on time. So how did you get here today?"}, {"instruction": "Just caught the bus.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, caught the bus to-to that-- to the stop outside the office?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, okay. So I'm noticing that this isn't the first time that you've been to see someone at probation and it's not your first, um, community sentence. So I was wondering when you're sitting on the bus thinking about coming here, what was- what was going through your head about being here?"}, {"instruction": "Just a waste of my time.", "input": "", "output": "Just was feeling like, \"Ugh, it's gonna be a waste of my time coming here.\""}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Mmh. So how come you thought it was going to be a waste of your time? What was it based on?"}, {"instruction": "Last time didn't really work out that well.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, didn't- didn't work out very well."}, {"instruction": "Nothing really helped me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So you're hoping that it was gonna help you and it didn't. That was-- ended up feeling like a waste of your time."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. So it sounds you're worried that it's gonna be a waste of your time this time too."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'd say so.", "input": "", "output": "Mm, okay. So what sort of things do you think made it a waste of time last time?"}, {"instruction": "She didn't really listen to me, just told me what to do. She just bossed me around.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, the probation officer we're talking about here?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. So it felt like she bossed you around, didn't really listen to you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she didn't really care.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so actually having someone listen to you and hear about what you're saying is important to you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Mm. So what's it gonna be like do you think working with me 'cause I'm also a female probation officer? Um, I'm wondering what-what's it gonna be like do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I-I don't care that you're a woman. It's just- it's that you don't know what it's like to be me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "You have a different upbringing and live in a different place of town. Just-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "-you wouldn't understand.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, and all of those things are true."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You're right. I don't know what it's like to be you and what I'm getting a sense of is that it's actually important that the person sitting opposite you in this role needs to understand what it's like to be you. Is that right?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, okay. So I guess the invitation for both of us really over the next few months of, um, on the sentence is for us to get an understanding about what it's like to be you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, so it is.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, okay. So in terms of the things that have brought you here, in terms of the things that have got you into trouble and got you into offending, I'm wondering how interested you are in, um, really getting an understanding of it. So one or zero is like, \"Ugh, not interested at all.\""}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "100 is like, \"I'm totally interested and-and getting it nailed and sorted and, you know, getting on the straight and narrow.\" Where would you be on that scale?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not too high. It's not like I'm out killing people or anything. It's just-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "-silly stuff.", "input": "", "output": "All right. So it's kind of silly stuff that's getting you into trouble."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what I'm hearing? Yeah. So in terms of dealing with it, where-where would you be, do you reckon? How interested would you be in dealing with that stuff?"}, {"instruction": "Mm, lots. When I stop getting caught. Don't wanna be back here again.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so you don't wanna be back here. You don't wanna be sitting here and-"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "-to talk to a probation officer again."}, {"instruction": "No, sorry.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So where would you be do you think?"}, {"instruction": "Mm, like what out of a scale it would like fall?", "input": "", "output": "Zero being, \"Argh, not interested at all,\" 100 being totally into it."}, {"instruction": "Mmh, 25.", "input": "", "output": "25, okay."}, {"instruction": "Mmh.", "input": "", "output": "So I know that you're kind of 25% interested-"}, {"instruction": "Mmh.", "input": "", "output": "-and really thinking about what's got you into trouble and hence something about what gets you into trouble."}, {"instruction": "Maybe but, mm, yeah, I wanna stop getting into trouble.", "input": "", "output": "You wanna stop getting into trouble."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I don't think what I'm doing is that bad.", "input": "", "output": "Mm, okay."}, {"instruction": "Just unlucky.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so getting into trouble and, uh, getting caught and-and we see  does about luck and this time being unlucky."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, the cops just have it out for me.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, tell me a bit more about that, Billy? Kind of give me the  the cops have got it on for you?"}, {"instruction": "Just 'cause growing up dealing with them and my mates and stuff and there's, you know, guilty before charged or whatever.", "input": "", "output": "Mm, so it feels like you always seemed singled out and, um, end up being unlucky."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, me and my mates always get singled out.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so you get singled out and that's what, um, means that you end up getting-- having to go to court and get sentenced and end on probation."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So I'm wondering, um, if there are things that you think, \"Well, I can see that that's got me into trouble,\" and, you know, kind of cops aside, things that might have got you into-into trouble."}, {"instruction": "Just jacking cars and just stealing just, like, stuff and smokes and got done for that.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm, okay. So some stuff that you can think, \"Oh yeah, I had, you know, I did some stuff that yeah, got me into trouble.\""}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "It wasn't perhaps about the police singling you out. So those little things, well, you think, \"Mm, yeah, maybe-maybe if I'd done something differently, I wouldn't have ended up in trouble.\" How interested are you in thinking about those things and-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, I-", "input": "", "output": "-trying to get a handle on that."}, {"instruction": "-wanna stop getting in trouble. Don't wanna-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "-end up in prison for the rest of my life for doing stupid little things.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so you don't wanna end up kind of being in prison again 'cause you've done some time inside. Yeah, and you don't wanna end up going back to prison, yeah. So-so that's one thing about wanting to make a difference and the way things are at the moment, yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Cool. What else would, um, would help to kind of keep you out of trouble do you think?"}, {"instruction": "Get some income, some good cash or something.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "A nice job.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "A good-- yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So the things about that have got you into trouble in the past, um, how confident are you that, um, that you can do something to not keep going down the same path? Zero is like, \"I'm not confident at all that I can make any changes,\" and 100 is like, \"I'm so supremely confident.\" Where would you be?"}, {"instruction": "Pretty confident if I had a good job but otherwise, probably have to keep stealing stuff, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "So it depends.", "input": "", "output": "All right, so if you were in a good job-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-one with cars, one that-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-you really liked, you feel that you would be pretty confident to deal with the stuff that gets you into trouble?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'cause it's just small stuff that, you know, just 'cause I don't have any cash.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so you don't have any cash and that's the stuff that causes you to do the small stuff-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-and get you into trouble."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, just stupid little shit, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so if you had a job, you feel pretty confident, but if you don't have a job, your confidence is much-is much lower, is that-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-what I'm hearing? Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, no. That's-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "-not an excuse but, yeah, I'll probably keep doing it. Just try not to get caught.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so if you don't have a job you reckon, um, you'll probably gonna keep on offending."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah, I just get bored and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so part of this, what's going on is you also getting bored?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I get bored real easy.", "input": "", "output": "Mmh. Yeah, say something more about that. It sounds really interesting about you knowing that you get bored really easily."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I got a short attention span or something.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, what-what makes you say that?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, just can't sit around home all day. I'd wanna go out and do something exciting.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so you wanna kind of get some action, don't wanna sit around-"}, {"instruction": "Mmh.", "input": "", "output": "-all the time. But one of the things I'm noticing, we've been going here for a wee while now talking and, uh, I haven't noticed any lack of attention."}, {"instruction": "Just talking about something I like. Like talking about cars is all good.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so we  something that interests you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Mmh, and when we might be talking about something that doesn't interest you, what would I notice?"}, {"instruction": "I probably just wouldn't listen.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. All right, so-so one of the challenges is for us to be talking about things that interest you. Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Um, and also maybe get to the point where things are different in your life Where you're not getting into trouble and things feel a bit more sorted in your life."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Hi, Billy, how are you doing? It's good to see you again."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, how's things been?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not too bad. Yeah, getting out of trouble.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So you're keeping out of trouble."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, so how'd you get here this time? Like 'cause other times you got the bus? What-what did you do this time?"}, {"instruction": "Ah, I got a lift from Donna. She's-", "input": "", "output": "Oh yeah. Who's- who's Donna? You haven't mentioned Donna before."}, {"instruction": "Like she's my new girlfriend.", "input": "", "output": "Oh okay. Tell us something about Donna."}, {"instruction": "Ah, just met her a few weeks ago and she's just, uh, real cool. She's really nice. Yeah, get along with her really well.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, you get along with her really well."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So what's special about Donna?"}, {"instruction": "Donna is easy to talk to unlike other girls that I don't really get along with. Uh, she's like and a good friend too so-", "input": "", "output": "Oh okay. So someone who's both a friend and a girlfriend?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I can hang out with her and stuff and she gets all my mates and stuff. So it's all good.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, yeah. It's really special when you find someone who can be both a friend and girlfriend, eh."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and I'm lucky.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. You were made to say you're lucky."}, {"instruction": "She's just a really nice girl.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Okay, so she dropped you off here today."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's good of her.", "input": "", "output": "So what does she think about you coming here?"}, {"instruction": "She thinks it's good. Yeah. Uh, she doesn't want to get in trouble and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "She doesn't want to get you in trouble and I heard you say earlier on that you've been keeping out of trouble."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I was just getting busy with her and stuff. So it's all good.", "input": "", "output": "So what sort of things have you been doing together?"}, {"instruction": "Just, uh, just hanging out. Just watching movies and stuff just, I don't know, gives me something to do.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Gives you something to do. So we talked like back on that first time we met about how you reckon you've got a short attention span and like things to like to be doing things."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So you're watching movies with her, you're hanging out?"}, {"instruction": "It's, yeah, just chilling with her. It's good.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, and keeping-keeping out of trouble."}, {"instruction": "Yeah mostly, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, what's the mostly?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, you know,  mostly.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So when you say mostly, it kind of leaves a little bit of room for there to be some trouble."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Am I picking that up?"}, {"instruction": "Oh no, just stupid stuff. Just when she like-- she has to go to work and stuff, so I have to keep myself busy.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so she's- she's got a job."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, what does she do?"}, {"instruction": "She just works the whole day just typing numbers and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So kind of 9:00 to 5:00 sort of job."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. She actually goes there four days a week though.", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "So we get to chill on Friday.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So you two get to spend Friday together and the weekend."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Okay, so when she's at work, what happens then?"}, {"instruction": "Well, uh, sleeping and then, I don't know, catch up my mates if they're not doing anything and just get up to mischief with them.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So what sort of mischief are we talking about here, Billy?"}, {"instruction": "It's, uh,  for the cars out there,  no not-not normally. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Okay, so you're kind of skating on the edges of getting in trouble again."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm being careful though so-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Okay. So I'm wondering how much of what you do on Fridays you tell Donna."}, {"instruction": "But what do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "Well, if we're talking about this idea about kind of scaling around the edges of trouble again,-"}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "- I'm wondering if she knows that."}, {"instruction": "No, not really.", "input": "", "output": "So what do you reckon would happen if she knew?"}, {"instruction": "She'd tell me off.", "input": "", "output": "She'd tell you off."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Well, what-what are her hopes for you, Billy?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, okay, she wants me to be happy, I don't know. Me to get a job or something. So, get a nice car we could cruise around in it.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Yeah. So she wants you to be happy."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So what would- what would like a really happy life for Billy look like?"}, {"instruction": "Just be able to buy her stuff. Nice car, nice house.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. A nice car, a nice house. Mm-hmm, what else? What must be a happy life for Billy?"}, {"instruction": "Just and it'd be good just me, her and just be able to provide for her would be cool.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm, okay. So in five years' time, it's fast forward to the future. Five years time, how would you like it to be?"}, {"instruction": "Just settle down and maybe have some kids or something, family life.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.

Um-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-I guess those are my big goals.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, do you see your substance use as being, um, maybe a cause of those other issues at all? Do you see them linked at all?"}, {"instruction": "I mean, yeah, I guess- I guess if I think about it, that's kind of the common theme.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Okay, um, how do you think that your substance use is going to affect your employment?"}, {"instruction": "I'm pretty worried that I'm gonna get fired.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I don't- I don't really know. We're the only shop in town that-that does the work that we use. So I don't- I don't know what else I'm gonna go do.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "So\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, and if you lost your job, what do you see being the consequences of that?"}, {"instruction": "Um, my wife might leave me. Uh, might lose the house. Um, can't pay my bills.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Do you see that at all as being affected by the substance use?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's probably- it's probably the reason why all that's happening. I mean-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-If I lose my job, it's 'cause I failed the UA, so\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, so can you talk to me a little bit about, um, maybe where you wanna be 90 days from now? What do you want your life to look like?"}, {"instruction": "I'll still have a job.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Still have a wife and, uh, yeah, if I-- If those two things can happen then, you know\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I mean, I know if-if I lose my job, she leaving me. She's been getting after me about smoking weed for a long time, so\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So that's where you wanna get to. Um, what do you think that you need to do in the next, like, month or so to maybe help going in that direction?"}, {"instruction": "Probably need to go talk to my boss and start taking some steps not to lose it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Um, I mean, it was just the, like a social gathering. It wasn't like I was looking for it, uh, the drinks were there and I-- all my friends were doing it and it was just-- it's-it's not something that I like do occa- on occasion, but whenever the opportunity presents itself, it-it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "But, Tommy, there's so many consequences with drinking. You know, you're not even 21 yet, you could get arrested, you could, you know, have a drunk driving accident. You could, you know, mess up your schoolwork. You have such a bright future ahead of you. It just really, really concerns me."}, {"instruction": "I-I get what you're coming from, but I-I-I really did. I-I thought that I had it under control and I didn't let myself get too far gone. I-I didn't want to be, um, how do I put this? Like, I want it to be in control and I wanted to make sure that all my friends were okay, so I didn't let myself drink too much.", "input": "", "output": "There's really no such thing as not drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too much, you know. Like, think about it, think about all the things that can happen to you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I-I understand exactly what you're saying. And\u2014", "input": "", "output": "How much are you drinking?"}, {"instruction": "I-I don't think I'm drinking that much. I mean, it's-it's mainly for social gatherings. Like it's nothing that I do, like by myself or whatever. It's just the\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Is it like every weekend?"}, {"instruction": "Every other weekends, I would say.", "input": "", "output": "Tommy, I'm just so concerned, you know, can't you think of anything better to do?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I-I guess I can. I-I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I-I do get you're coming from and\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Is-- are your friends the problem, like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you were partying with?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess I haven't really put it on myself. I guess it's really been forced on their account. And I've just been following in their footsteps just to-- just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun. And I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can.", "input": "", "output": "Well, there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? That's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and-and really doing what's best for you. And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here."}, {"instruction": "Mm. Yeah. I-I-I do see that maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to-to a certain degree. And I-- it does make a lot of sense. And I-I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking that\u2014", "input": "", "output": "I think you really need to quit."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me, wherever I go and parties and stuff that. I-I kind of feel like I should just, uh, get used to it or at least understand its, uh, its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely. I don't- I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life.", "input": "", "output": "I think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, um, I wish you would quit. If all you're going to do is cut down, that's better than nothing. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it. It's really important."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I-I-I just-- I don't see the problem in it right now and maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic of an experience but I'm\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Do you wanna wait for that happen? Do you wanna wait for a dramatic experience?"}, {"instruction": "You're-you're right. I-I don't want- I don't wanna be too far gone before it's too late. Like I-I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape. And I-I guess I've never really had any-any real experience where the alcohol has really affected me that much or affected anybody close to me that much. So I guess it's something that I feel like I'm control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I-I think that that would be a good step forward into-- and a life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true- the true aspects of life rather than the-the haziness of alcohol.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, sounds good."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Hi, Jean. I'm Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you."}, {"instruction": "Good morning, doctor.", "input": "", "output": "How can I help you today?"}, {"instruction": "Well, doctor, I-I made an appointment with you finally, because I was diagnosed over three months ago with a pulmonary disease, COPD.", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "And although I didn't call right away. I really need some help in quitting smoking.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something.", "input": "", "output": "It's time to do something, okay. So you've been diagnosed by-"}, {"instruction": "A respirologist.", "input": "", "output": "A respirologist diagnosed that, and-and how are you feeling right now?"}, {"instruction": "I'm- I'm really scared, uh, 'cause I don't feel well.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.", "input": "", "output": "All right. So it sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm. I-I don't know what I'm going to do about it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by?"}, {"instruction": "I'm giving myself six months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like a long time away, but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time. I don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I've gone through therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally- I went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit.", "input": "", "output": "Right. So you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital."}, {"instruction": "I had no choice, I had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is. Uh, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, it's part of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at home. My parents smoked. All of their friends smoked. It was on television. Everybody looked so grand.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess. It's-it's good for my nerves.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, \"Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out.\"", "input": "", "output": "Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right?"}, {"instruction": "That's right.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Is there anything I missed?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I enjoy it. It just- it relaxes me. It's great after a meal, um, for me-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-we all just do it as a little group of people, uh, my family.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "The people I work with, we go out in the courtyard-", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "-have a cigarette and talk. That's how you make friends. A lot of people, um, we're like a little group now, we're all- a little bunch of us.", "input": "", "output": "So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette."}, {"instruction": "I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you're right.", "input": "", "output": "You've told me what is good about smoking for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so good about smoking for you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.", "input": "", "output": "Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you?"}, {"instruction": "Um, it's expensive, really got expensive, and I smoked 30, 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day. And I'm starting to buy different makeup 'cause I'm starting to really age, starting to get lines in my face and wrinkles and my skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So let me make sure I've understood this piece as well. So the not good things or the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health, effects on your physical appearance and how you'll look and-and-and the amount of investment that you're making in makeup and getting your nails done, et cetera. And then the cost of smoking."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do, and 1 would be the least important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking?"}, {"instruction": "It's for me, for my health, and for the money and everything I've said, I would say it's 10 or- out of 10 that I should quit smoking.", "input": "", "output": "Definitely most important."}, {"instruction": "Yes. A hundred percent, one of the most important things.", "input": "", "output": "Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I, I'd say 35 or 40% competent.", "input": "", "output": "35-40%. Okay."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I'd like to say more, but, um-", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm- I guess I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I- it's starting to- I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty good that I came to see you. I-I- it was a step and a couple of people who care about me actually, uh, gave me a pat on the back that I came to see you. So-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-this was a big step. So I guess, yes. Um, it wouldn't have been as high maybe last week.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe if I could come to see you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe if there was a group or something. I-I don't know, but I-I need some help.", "input": "", "output": "So if you got help, that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%."}, {"instruction": "I-I think so because I feel a little better that I just came to see you today.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Discussing things helps me. I always feel better when I get things out.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts about that?"}, {"instruction": "In other words, think about it more, don't- don't just do it automatically.", "input": "", "output": "That's correct. And writing it down helps that process."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. I think so because, um, when I get the urge, I could maybe fight it and, um, maybe wait till the next urge-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-and maybe mark that down that, uh, I didn't go right away when something went wrong. Um, yes, I-I can try that.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss. Okay. Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "No, that gives me something to work towards until I see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Excellent. Well, thank you so much for coming in today."}, {"instruction": "Thank you for seeing me, doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Hi, I'm Bruce Berger, I work in the clinic. I know you're here to pick up a prescription today."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Um, I noticed, uh, we noticed some of your records that, uh, you've been coming in and getting Sarah's resc-rescue inhaler for her asthma quite frequently, and you haven't got a chronic inhaler for quite some time now. I also know she has been in the emergency room several times this year. Is-- can you tell me what's going on there?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I did a research on the chronic inhaler, and I saw that there were steroids in it, and I do not want my daughter taking steroids. I read about all the side effects of steroids and all the potential health problems. I don't want her taking them, and I just want to tell you right up front, I do not want to hear anything about the fact that I do smoke. Um, I smoke outside, I smoke away from her. I do not ever do it around her. So I do not want to hear about that.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I-I need to tell you that the-the medicine that she's taking, the chronic inhaler, which is really essential to controlling her asthma does-- is not a steroid like you're thinking. It's-it's much safer, it's very safe, she-- and she needs to take it to get her asthma under control, and I also want to tell you that, uh, your smoking does affect her asthma, even if- even if it's outside, it gets on her clothes, and to be honest, I'd like to see you quit smoking for you anyway. But, uh, if you want to keep her out of the emergency room, she needs to use that chronic inhaler every day, and you need to watch your smoking."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I-I am not going to allow her to take any kind of steroid. I am not going to allow that to happen. She's my daughter. She's my responsibility, and I'm not going to allow that to happen, and I absolutely make sure that the smoking does not affect her.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I, you know, I-I don't want to argue with you about this. I-I know that if you-you know, and if you want to keep Sarah out of the emergency room, uh, I-I just wish you'd heed what I'm saying. She needs to use that chronic inhaler every day to get her- to get her asthma under control, and the smoke on your clothes and the smoking flares her asthma up. So she really needs to use that chronic inhaler, and you really need to think about quitting smoking."}, {"instruction": "Fine. I'm in a really big hurry, and I need to get those prescriptions filled as soon as possible, please.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, well, I-I hope you really listen to what I'm telling you about her using that chronic inhaler, and I hope you consider quitting smoking."}, {"instruction": "Fine. I just need to get my prescriptions.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I think the activity piece is the kind of low-hanging fruit that I see. Um, I feel like it's gonna be harder for me to change some of my nutrition habits right out the gate, but if I can get into maybe an activity routine, that that could be good to help maybe some of the other changes happen later.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Okay. So physical activity is feeling like the easiest change to look at first."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think so.", "input": "", "output": "Great. So tell me a little bit more about your motivators for getting started in being more physically active. I know you shared energy levels and I know you've shared, um, that you'd like to see a boost in your mood and feeling less irritable and stressed. Any other benefits that really make you wanna make this change right now?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think just to feeling like physically stronger, um, like physically more able. Uh, last night I like struggled with the jar of salsa, like opening it. So I think that just stuff like that, um, you know, would be in addition to mood and being more productive and energy and all that stuff. Um, yeah, that that would be a definite end goal for me too. And then really to like, I think if I am more active, I think my body image or my body confidence would improve also.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So you're wanting to feel stronger so that you can open jars and other things and- and also just have a better sense of confidence."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Great. So on a scale from zero to 10, zero being not at all ready to make a change in the area of physical activity, and 10 being let's- let's do this. I'm excited. I'm ready. Um, where- where do you fall on that scale?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm, I'd say I'm about an eight.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So you're- you're feeling fairly motivated."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Uh, why didn't you pick a six?"}, {"instruction": "Well, like I said, I just, I've identified like a lot of things that I think would be good. Um, if I were to be more active and I definitely wanna have that improved mood and energy, um, and feel better about myself. Um, so yeah, all of those things I think are what's really driving that- that rating.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. You're noticing there- there are too many great benefits to being physically active and, um, today you've mentioned energy, mood, strength and body confidence."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Am I missing anything else?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Those are the big ones for you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Fantastic. Well, um, now we can start looking at if you're interested in how that might look-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "- and- and what activities you might end up, um, choosing."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that'd be great.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Um, how about if we talk about, uh, the problem that I'm really having is, um, getting somebody motivated to do something, um, such as move out of my house.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so, um, there would be, so what you're, what you're attempting to do is, um, well-- Tell me, I guess, uh, tell me a little bit more about it so I understand it a little bit more."}, {"instruction": "Well, I-I offered my home to somebody and, uh, for, you know, uh, a transitional period.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "You know, and it seems that, um, it's hard for me to be assertive and say I think the, um, the, uh, transitional period is- has come and it's beginning to time to transition. So.", "input": "", "output": "So that's a really kind thing of you to do to take someone into your home like that when they need help like that. And, um, but right now, you're thinking that, uh, time is up you'd like to get this person, you know, you're-you're-you're ready to have him or her move out and have your place back to yourself."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's, it's absolutely right that I want, I-I want change but I'm not, I am kind of, like, weak in that area where it's, like, the ability to actually say the words. You're right, yeah. I'd like to be able to do that.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. And what would, uh, what would help you get to the point of actually, um, booting them out?"}, {"instruction": "Um.  I don't know, I'm-I'm, I guess, I'm kind of, um, I care about the person and, you know, there's a certain amount of comfortability of having somebody with you, you know, and I'm just, so, I guess I am at war with myself because part of me wants the comfort of having a companion and the other part of me is just, you know-- I-I cannot-- I am not really sure what I wanna do, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So you kind of feel two ways about it. You-you'd like to, um, you feel like at some level that the time is up for that person to go, and on the other hand, there's a certain amount of security in having him in the house and in knowing he's around."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you know, it's kind of, like, the old sock- song saying hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.  And\u2014", "input": "", "output": "But you're not quite ready if you wanna sing that song."}, {"instruction": " Well, first of all I think he would hit the road if I started singing that song 'cause I can sing. ", "input": "", "output": "I thought you did a pretty nice job singing there right there, it's scary to be quite honest with you and I appreciate, I also appreciate your sense of humor in-in doing that."}, {"instruction": "Well, you know, in life you have to have a sense of humor in my- the way I view and otherwise, you know, I'd be like where's the news.  I mean, it's either\u2014", "input": "", "output": "That really helps you get through things is to be able to laugh about it."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, I have to laugh, I mean, even comedians say, you know, uh, most of-- What I've heard about comedians is that they are really not always that happy and they use that in a comical way to, you know, deal with life, so, yeah.  I kind of, maybe I should go into that.  Like this girl\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Your new career."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, like this girl Ruth that I know she's-she's, uh, got a serious job and she kind of does that on the side. ", "input": "", "output": "So, um, what are the uh, uh, what would be the benefits to you right now to having him out of the house?"}, {"instruction": "Mm. Let's see. Well, you know, I'm really not sure, I kind of, you know. Um, I'm having a hard time with that. Um.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me a bit more about that."}, {"instruction": "Mm, well, I have to really think about it because-", "input": "", "output": "Some guilt?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. Maybe some guilt and I, um, uh, I just, you know,  I go back and forth a little bit, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Cause you wanna do the right thing because you're- because you're a good person and that's a- that's a really important value to you is that you- is that you help people out."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I-I- yeah. I mean I- thank you. I-I-I appreciate you saying that I'm a good person. Like I feel I am. Um\u2014", "input": "", "output": "But you've done your duty. Duty is done."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Oops, it's just hard to- it's just hard to, um, er, yeah. I- my j- my job is done and I have to start to realize that I have to be a little bit more assertive, I think, and a little bit more, um, sure of myself.", "input": "", "output": "And so, what have you done in order to start getting them to Hit The Road, Jack?"}, {"instruction": "Well, um, I've had co-conversations about with him and sometimes not-not so pleasant, but I'm-I'm just making, you know, 'cause I happen to sometimes just like hold things in. And then finally I- at-at one point I was really, you know, very logical about it. And then the other day I kind of got not so logical about it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "", "input": "", "output": "So, uh, you were telling me earlier though that you've talked to some other people and he has some options about some other places to go to."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.

And that shows that you care. And even more, it shows that you care about your mom and that, in the end, it doesn't sound like you wanna leave her alone because you're still worried about ot-you're still worried about all the burdens on her that you're even thinking of removing yourselves to make her life easier.

Ending your life hurting yourself when it's just you and your mom. And you just said, she's a single parent. She doesn't have a husband, you don't have a dad. It's just the two of you. So how could it be the right choice? But I understand your pain and I know where you're coming from. And I know that the release that you feel physically is something that helps you in the moment. Are there other things that we can help you find to start replacing, um, that behavior?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't know. I don't know. It's just, um, I'm not sure I can.", "input": "", "output": "You're not sure. So you have a lot of on your mind right now. You just opened up to me. You told me that you've been cutting, that you've also been thinking about hurting yourself, killing yourself, not being here. Short-term, the cutting is helping you. You feel like a burden to mom, that stresses you out. That makes you sad. You see how much she struggles, but also on the same hand, we see how much you've been trying and how much you've been trying to help out by trying to go to school. We know your attendance is good. You go most of the time, you know, you're trying to keep up your grades.You have a C average, even having A in math, which we know was the lowest grade you had all semester. So all of those things shows how much effort you've put in and we see that effort. So you've been doing what you can and it's normal to feel like sometimes it's not enough.

So what about maybe sharing a little bit about your alcohol intake and maybe a little bit about what your- what your life's like a little bit for me today?"}, {"instruction": "Um, okay. Uh, well, I guess I drink like a glass of wine at supper every night, and just to, you know, relax a little with my friends if I go out. So wine has always been a kind of a family tradition with supper.

So, you know, I'm independent and I'm gonna- I'm gonna do what I want, it's my body.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So you don't feel very comfortable with somebody telling you what you should be consuming, what kind of alcohol, and how much alcohol you should be consuming. And, um, it sounds like you've been getting some mixed messages, your doctor's saying there's no safe amount of alcohol you can drink, and asked you to come and see me. And then also, you've been checking- sounds like you've been checking things out a little bit."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.

So it's- yeah. I don't know, but, um, I'm here anyway.

And that's if a woman isn't pregnant. And when it says in the guidelines, as far as drinking, uh, throughout pregnancy, there is no safe amount to drink during pregnancy.

It's just a fancy little brochure saying what I've already known, I've already heard.", "input": "", "output": "So you feel like, um, what the doctor's saying and this brochure just kind of feels like, yeah, it's just kind of blowing things up out of proportion a little bit."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "And it sounds like you-you've got some solid information already that alcohol, you know, has been safe to-to have during pregnancy.

Well, it's like all this brochure is saying is that, um, the same again, the same thing that I've heard, that the limits and that there is no safe amount of drink during pregnancy, but it's like, why not?", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "You know, it's kind of like the \"why\" that it's like-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-I never get that information.", "input": "", "output": "Wha-what's the big deal if you're drinking and\u2014"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, like what kind of issues would that cause if any?", "input": "", "output": "Maybe we can kind of put that on the shelf for a moment, and we'll come back to it and sort of look at, you know, what is- what does the guidelines have to say about why.

Um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. And, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. And you're right, you're not drinking as much as some people out there.

So, what would that look like for you?"}, {"instruction": "Mm, um, you know, I-I guess drinking no more than maybe three or four times a week, and-and on the weekends, which is when I would drink the most, cup back to no more than five or six beers.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white.

So that's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week.

From this, uh, drinker's pyramid over on this side of the card, you can see that the-the score on your screening sheet shows that you're up in the harmful category of drinkers. So that it's likely you're drinking, you know, in quantities probably more than about 90% of the folks who come in to see me here at the clinic."}, {"instruction": "Well, I know my drinking has increased a little since I got divorced and moved to Portland, but I-I don't think it's that much of a problem.", "input": "", "output": "It doesn't feel like a problem to you right now, yeah."}, {"instruction": "No, not really.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, okay. And then the other thing I should mention, Jill, um, drinking more than these quantities, it's-it's possible it could be pushing your blood pressure up a bit, and I'm wondering if that might be affecting the difficulty we're having getting your blood pressure down right now."}, {"instruction": "I didn't realize that drinking had anything to do with blood pressure.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Yeah, it can sometimes."}, {"instruction": "Oh, well. Well, then I guess that could be a problem.", "input": "", "output": "My perspective as a doctor, it would be good if you could think about cutting back a little bit or doing something different about your drinking.

So on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to do that and 10 being very ready, where would you lie on that scale?"}, {"instruction": "I'd probably a 6.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Okay, so that sounds-- I think that's great. So why would you be up at a six and not down at a two level? What kinds of thing would push you to be there?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't realize that drinking was related to my blood pressure problems.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "And I did fall earlier this year on my home from the bar and hurt my shoulder. I don't think the drinking made me fall, but it probably didn't help the situation.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "And though my son keeps telling me that I'm drinking too much, and it's scary to think that my drinking is harmful. It's a big word.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Yeah. So you've got some good reasons to try to cut back a little bit."}, {"instruction": "Sounds like it to me.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. And it sounds like you're willing to maybe try not going to the bar quite as much and maybe drinking a little bit less when you go to the bar."}, {"instruction": "I think I can try to do that, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So to what levels do you think you could do that? Where-where would you wanna go with your drinking?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I could use those numbers, and I can't make any promises, but I could try to drink less than three in a night and less than seven in a week.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Okay."}, {"instruction": "That mean I can only drink two or three times a week.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So you'd drink maybe just a couple of times a week and maybe a little bit less on each occasion? Is that what you're saying?"}, {"instruction": "Like I can try that, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Okay."}, {"instruction": "I don't think I need to quit, but I think I can try to cut down.", "input": "", "output": "And you think you're-you're able to cut down to those levels of no more than seven a week?"}, {"instruction": "That's what I'll shoot for.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I think that sounds like a great step for you as your doctor. Why don't we revisit this the next time you come in to talk about your blood pressure in about six weeks or so and, um, then we can see how you're doing with it."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "All right?"}, {"instruction": "Sounds good.", "input": "", "output": "Well, let's get back to your blood pressure then and see what we need to do about that."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Hi, Liz.

I think it's just that I have a busy schedule.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "I just need to find the time to do it. And, yes, I might be lacking a little bit of motivation, but I think it's more timing and trying to fit it in.", "input": "", "output": "And that sounds like a lot of excuses to me. So I feel like you had shared with me before that you do have a gym membership. So I think that's something that you just need to fit in your schedule. So for you to really see results that you want, my guess is you need to go about three to four times a week and really fit in that hour workout, um, on a daily basis."}, {"instruction": "But I think that part of the problem is that I-I don't have three to four times- three to four times a week to do it, or an hour even.

The safest level of drinking for teenagers is zero drinks. That's because we know a number of negative things are more likely to happen when adolescents drink.

Sexual assault is another thing more likely to happen and so are sexually transmitted diseases. I'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do what the possibility of having an STD?"}, {"instruction": "Um, yeah. I was drinking the last time I had sex. Um, the guy had been drinking too, and we didn't use a condom.", "input": "", "output": "Do you remember giving consent when you had sex?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. We've had sex before and we've used a condom before.", "input": "", "output": "How do you think drinking alcohol affected using a condom this time?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we just didn't stop to put one on. We weren't thinking that way.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like drinking changes how you think in those moments?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I would've definitely told him to put on a condom if I was sober.", "input": "", "output": "There's something else I wanna share. When people forget where they are or how many drinks they've had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. And when people keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call alcohol use disorder."}, {"instruction": "Well, that's not me. I don't need help from anyone.", "input": "", "output": "I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, it's fun. I like drinking when my friends are drinking too. Um, I laugh more. It's just fun.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And what about your drinking do you not like?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't like forgetting where I'm at sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "I really don't want any STDs.", "input": "", "output": "Right. So, on one hand, you like the feeling of being relaxed and having fun when you're drinking and on the other hand, you don't like forgetting where you are or forgetting how many drinks you've had and you don't like putting yourself at risk for STDs?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So, when you think about what you like and not like about your drinking, where do you wanna go from here? What would you like to change about your drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I definitely don't want to drink too much again.", "input": "", "output": "How ready are you to not drink too much? If I asked you to pick a number on a scale of 0 to 10, and 10 being totally ready, what number would you pick?"}, {"instruction": "Um, a nine.", "input": "", "output": "Very ready to stop drinking too much. Why do you think you picked such a high number like nine rather than a lower number like a six or a seven?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I really don't want any STDs and I don't like wondering whether I have one or not.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What plan could you come up with to make sure you achieve that goal?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, I wanna count my drinks so I don't have more than two and I want to stop drinking once I start feeling drunk.", "input": "", "output": "Great. Who could help you reach this goal?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I have this friend who thinks I drink too much. She would probably be willing to make me promise not to have more than two drinks at a party.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And how about unprotected sex? It sounds like you don't want to experience that again."}, {"instruction": "I'm going to talk with him and I'm gonna make him promise that we always use a condom and that we don't have sex drunk.", "input": "", "output": "All right. So, you're very motivated to change your drinking and you have a plan to keep from drinking more than two drinks at parties and keep from having unprotected sex. I would like to share how it's working for you. What do you think about coming back in six weeks or so?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Great. Thanks for talking with me and I look forward to seeing you again soon."}, {"instruction": "Well, um, since we spoke last, I've been to the gym a couple of times.", "input": "", "output": "You have?"}, {"instruction": "I have.", "input": "", "output": "That's fantastic."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and actually, my pants feel a little better too. I'm very pleased with it.", "input": "", "output": "So, what else have you noticed other than your-your pants are fitting better?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I do feel better.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "My back\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Your-- my what?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my back doesn't hurt nearly so much.", "input": "", "output": "Wow."}, {"instruction": "And, um, but it seems like it's, um-- but it's still hard. I'd like to go more often or I-I guess that I'm-- I just need to be a little more patient with myself because it's, um, I'm not, uh, I'm not-- I wanna be able to like spend more time at the gym but right now, it's um, not, um-- Well, I guess I need to build up to it.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So and what would you-- What would- What would help you get to building up to it? Spending more time there."}, {"instruction": "Um, well, I guess just sticking with it and not getting, um, sidetracked.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Like last week, I-I didn't get there at all until like Thursday during the week,-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-so it was- it was a frustrating week like for the gym that way.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I was kinda busy with some other things, but, um\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. But you made it-- You made it one day-"}, {"instruction": "I-I got\u2014", "input": "", "output": "-instead of zero days."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and actually, I made it again on Saturday too. So.", "input": "", "output": "That's fantastic."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Even with this, you know, pretty horrendous schedule going on."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's been a little-little hectic, you know. And, uh-- But, I-I don't like it too much because there's all these younger guys that can lift a lot more weight than me or they can stay on the treadmill longer and it-it-it's a little discouraging, you know. 'Cause I don't know if you've noticed, I'm not buff and they are. And it's-it's a little discouraging to think how much work it's gonna take to get, you know, kinda back towards that.", "input": "", "output": "So you-you'd like to get buffed?"}, {"instruction": "No, but, um, when-when I'm not at the gym, and I am my normal rational self, I realize that I'm, you know, way, way past the age of where I would really even want to do that, let alone want to spend the time it takes. But then while I'm at the gym, and I see the buff young guys, you know, lifting a lot of weight and all that stuff, then you know, the-- I don't know, the urge to be buff comes up in me.", "input": "", "output": "So, but for right now, it sounds like the-- just having the pants fit better-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-sounds really, you know, like it's making you feel good about yourself and\u2014"}, {"instruction": "It is.", "input": "", "output": "What other positive things have you noticed about the exercise?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I noticed-- Well, I-I still need to work on my diet a lot. I haven't-- I-I'd like to say that by working out at the gym, I have, uh, I've -I've modified my diet, but I haven't very much. I've gotten a little bit better with that, but I'd like to do a lot more.", "input": "", "output": "In what way have you gotten a little bit better?"}, {"instruction": "Um, a little bit less junk food. Um, like at times, when I'm like I feel like, \"Oh, I think I'll just go have a candy bar,\" or some worthless thing like that I'll actually have second thoughts before I do it.", "input": "", "output": "So you're at the second thought part. And what do you think would-- might take you, uh, over to actually doing it if you wanted to?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I think, uh, when I really start seeing some results at the gym, it's kinda, uh, I think the way it works in my mind is if I've worked out really hard and I've- and I've-- say I've lost a pound that week-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-you know, and then as I'm looking at that double or triple fudge four-decker of ice cream Sunday thing, you know, that somebody is eating, I would say, \"Wow, that would be about two hours on the treadmill.\" Then-then that would be probably-- the-- that would keep me from actually ordering one of those.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, okay. The payoff just wouldn't be worth that two hours of treadmill versus that double fudgy browny thingy."}, {"instruction": "Right, decadent-- Why do they put the word decadent in food?", "input": "", "output": "'Cause it is decadent, it's lovely."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yummy, so-"}, {"instruction": "Okay. But it seems to be going so far so good. I-I guess, you know, I can like, you know, um, I-I'm-I'm pretty pleased with who-- how it's going on. Um, I'm really-- I'm glad we talked that last time 'cause it-it was the impetus to get me to go the first time in a long, long time.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aiden and that should help with the ear infection, but in looking through the chart, I mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "That's really a big problem."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's pretty stressful for both of us. He gets really upset.", "input": "", "output": "Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually smoke exposure. Are you smoking?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I-- Yeah, I do smoke, but I don't smoke around him. I try really hard not to smoke around him.", "input": "", "output": "Well, the fact that he's having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke, and so, what can you tell me about that?"}, {"instruction": "I-I don't know. I mean, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I don't smoke in the car. Um, when he's home, I go outside to smoke. I just-- I mean, I know it's bad, and I know it's bad for him, so I don't want him to be around it so I try really hard.", "input": "", "output": "I really need you to quit smoking. Both for your health and for Aiden. Did you know s-smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections, it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here. Also, things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, um, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. It's really putting him at a lot of risk. In addition to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?"}, {"instruction": "No, but I don't smoke. I'm-- I-I-I've thought about quitting, but it's just- It's really hard so I just don't know how to do it.", "input": "", "output": "Well, now's the time to quit. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease, for all kinds of things-"}, {"instruction": "I know, I know. I've heard-- People have told me before, I've heard all that. I just don't know how to do it. How am I supposed to quit? It's-it's so hard.", "input": "", "output": "Well, there's all kinds of things you can use now. It's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement. There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum, there's the inhaler, there's nasal spray. We can talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban, there's quit smoking groups you can go to, there's hotlines you can call."}, {"instruction": "I just don't have time for any of that.", "input": "", "output": "There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit, this is really important."}, {"instruction": "I understand that. I know it is. I mean, everybody has problems, right? It's just really-- It's really, really hard.", "input": "", "output": "Well, what can be more important to you than the health of your child?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking. This is really important."}, {"instruction": "I'll-I'll-I'll go look at all those things and-and I'll find-- I guess I'll-I'll try to find something, and-and I'll talk to my doctor about it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and your child in danger."}, {"instruction": "Okay, whatever. Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Um, pretty obvious .", "input": "", "output": "So, what happened. So first of all, tell me what you did, exactly."}, {"instruction": "What do you mean what I did?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I mean, where did you cut yourself? I know you said you cut yourself when you-"}, {"instruction": "That's the same as always. Same as always.", "input": "", "output": "Like your arm?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "What did you cut yourself with?"}, {"instruction": "A razor?", "input": "", "output": "How deep?"}, {"instruction": "Do you wanna see it?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Let me see. You know those look to me like they-they-- did you go to the-- It doesn't look like you went and got any stitches, but that looks to me like you could have used them. What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I think have you ever been to an ER when you cut yourself, you'd know why I don't go.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, but part of the problem is those look deep and like you're going to have significant scars. So my suggestion is in the future, if you do it, is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed. But let's talk about how, um, how this happened. First of all, tell me, you were telling me on that phone that you wanted to die. But, um, did you-- Was this a suicide attempt or do you think it was just-just a cutting? Were thinking of killing yourself or wanting to kill yourself or wanting to die when you did it?"}, {"instruction": "I was thinking about killing myself. You thought you would help me and you didn't. That's what I want to talk about. I wanna talk about how it is that my life is not going better and you are not helping me, and you are not available to me when I need help.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So let's-- Okay, so it sounds like me not being avai-- Was me not being available with you, rela-related to you cutting yourself?"}, {"instruction": "I cut myself the first time I called you thinking you would help me, you wouldn't help me so then I figured, what the hell I  might as well just go all the way. And so, that's why I cut myself that deep.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I want to thank you for coming in today to see me. Um, I do understand from talking with your counselor that you've got quite a bit on your plate, you've got a lot going on. Can you tell me a little bit about that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, um, I have a two-year-old son, and then I work full time as a server at a restaurant, and then recently, I also started going back to night class, so you know, just the combination of all that, you know. I-I've just been feeling really stressed lately.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, I could see that. Um, may I ask, are you also a single mom?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So you've got a lot of stressors right now. You're a single mom raising a two-year-old, you're working full time, and you're going back to school. What do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I-I told the counselor that I think childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about that?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Um, well, my mom normally watches my son, but lately, it's kind of becoming a problem. You know, she like will back out at the last second, and so I've had to call in at work a couple of times. I've had to miss class a few times. So i-it's just stressful worrying about, you know, whether I'll be able to do those things or not.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So I'm hearing you say that the situation with your mom's not ideal. You actually miss class sometime and had to lose some work shifts as well, and that's problematic."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, exactly.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, outside your mom, is there anyone else that can help with childcare?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, I have a sister, but I don't really trust her to watch my son, and I don't really know that many people that-- the only thing I can think of, I have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped one time when my mom backed out. She-she actually has, uh, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked out.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't really know her that well, but I mean, she seems nice and I-I think she did a pretty good job that night.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So what I hear you saying is this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her to be."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Stepped in last minute. Um, when you picked up your son, you didn't have any concerns and he seemed happy?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Let's pursue that neighbor a little bit. Um, people like that, I like to think of as natural resources, but I know for a lot of people, the major problem with, uh, childcare is affordability."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Have you given any thought to, if you'll be able to afford to pay someone on a regular basis to watch your son?"}, {"instruction": "I-- you know, I mean, maybe a little bit, but I don't really make that much money to be able to afford something like daycare or, you know, like full time babysitting.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, I can understand that. Um, what are some of your natural skills?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I mean, I-I like cooking. I'm-I'm actually in school for culinary arts.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I bet you're a really good cook then. Um, what would you think about a plan where you worked out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange for her watching your son, you would prepare dinner for her and her, um, daughter?"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Um, you know, you could maybe swap a meal for child care. What do you think of a idea like that?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. That's, that's interesting. I-I never really thought of something like that, but, yeah, it might work.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Okay, I'm glad you think so. Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. No, I-- you know, there-there just aren't that many people I trust right now with my son.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I can respect that. You-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow your own intuition on that. Um, what about the baby's father, is he of any help?"}, {"instruction": " No, no, not at all. He, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, fine. You know what? We've got one really good lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in school?"}, {"instruction": "It's-it's three nights right now, so I have class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Um, so what would it look like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mom were helping you out?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, you know, if my neighbor could even just take over one day of watching my son, I think that would help my mom quite a bit.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, if you could just reduce the amount of time that you're needing your mom, she might be more supportive, more onboard?"}, {"instruction": "I mean, I think so, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Um, so what do you think would be your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom?"}, {"instruction": "Mom, you know, just, I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this idea, and if she is, you know, telling my mom about it and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a little better and maybe a little bit more reliable.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Sounds like you got a good plan to follow up on there. All right. Um, now you mentioned that your son is two. When will he turn three?"}, {"instruction": "Just a couple months from now. He's almost three.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, in that I-- in that case, I've got another idea for you. Um, what about, um, maybe when he turns three, you could enroll him in Head Start? Are you familiar with that program?"}, {"instruction": "I've heard of it, but I don't know that much.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Head Start is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program. Um, it was really created for parents and families, just like yours, folks who have a lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start really prepares your child both socially and intellectually for going to school. Um, and you know, by the time he turns three, you may find that that routine is something that's better for him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more information on local Head Start sites?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare for sure.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, good. Um, all right. It sounds like you've got a good plan there going forward. Um, now I did see from the nurse practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How's that going?"}, {"instruction": " Well, you know, I-I've been working on it a couple of weeks now, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I expected. Um, trying to break my routine in the evenings, especially has-has been hard, but, um, you know, a couple of nights I have reached my goal in terms of, you know, number of cigarettes I'm going to smoke and number of drinks. So, I mean, I've done okay some days, but others, not so much.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So what I hear you say is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. So yeah, that's really to be commended. I just want to ask you one thing though. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers of that and how that might be impacting your son?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. I definitely have, so I-I try to never smoke around him, and if I do smoke at home, I always go out to the balcony to smoke.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, okay, good. You know, I can tell you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, just from our conversation today, I can tell you're a really good mom. Um, let's reflect back on what we've discussed here so far. Now, we've got a couple of good options between the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare. What do you see as your next steps in getting that going?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it. Hopefully, that kind of helps her situation out. And then, um, I'm definitely want to look into the Head Start idea because I think that would be really good.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, okay. Good. Um, I think you've got a good plan there. Um, what would you say to us getting back together, say, in two weeks, just for us to kind of revisit and see what kind of progress you've made, you know, if you've got something worked out, great, but if you've hit a bump in the road, I tell you what, we'll put our heads together. We'll come up with another plan."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Good. Well, I want to thank you again for coming in today, Sarah. It was really nice to have met you."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. All right.", "input": "", "output": "You're very welcome."}, {"instruction": "Oh, great.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, always happy to hear that. I do have some concerns though because I'm seeing some irritation in your mouth in the palate that's called nicotinic stomatitis and-"}, {"instruction": "That sounds bad.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, it is. It's some damage to the roof of your mouth that happens from tobacco smoking and so I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit how-- about how tobacco fits in your life right now."}, {"instruction": "Tobacco. Well, I don't smoke cigarettes. I've never smoked cigarettes. I do go out with my friends. Um, you know, we go out to bars and, you know, we'll have a few drinks and smoke some of those little cigarillo-type things. I mean I wouldn't even think of them as cigars and they're certainly not cigarettes. Um, and I mean I'll have one or two of those in an evening with, uh, with my friends but certainly not 20 or 30 of them a day like you would with cigarettes and that's the only thing that could possibly have anything to do with tobacco.", "input": "", "output": "So you've made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you're kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. But you have been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time you go out."}, {"instruction": "But that's- that's just like a- a social thing. That's something that my friends and I do. We-- We-- It's not habit or something that I have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out for an evening. Not packs of them.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, so you're not-- You're not like those chain smokers, you're not smoking packs and packs a day."}, {"instruction": "Oh, no. No.", "input": "", "output": "The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth."}, {"instruction": "Well, we've-- you have a point there. Mm, now that you mention it, um, I have started having one or two at work, you know, when we have break since I have a couple of friends at work that smoke and so every time we have a break, you know, we all go out to the- the break place outside, um, and so I- now I go with them and I have one of these Swisher Sweets. Um, I like the peach flavor  they're so cute. But that's really only pretty recently.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you're smoking."}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah, yeah. You know now that you say it like that it's true. Um, I am smoking on a daily basis.", "input": "", "output": "So aside from that social aspect, what are the things you like about it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's relaxing and it's just nice to be with people, um. Um, and you know, when, you know, I like to go to Las Vegas, and so when we go to Vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar bars, is kind of sophisticated and fun and so, you know, it's mostly a social thing.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I was going to ask you about, um, whitening my teeth because I've noticed that they have more stains on them up than a few years ago, and so I imagine that has something to do with the smoking.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other things that you're concerned about?"}, {"instruction": "Um. Well, there's the expense, you know. Wi-with the economy and all, um, I- I have to be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of if I'm buying more of them than I used to. So the-the money aspect is also a concern.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Were you aware of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, absolutely not. I mean I thought of it more as a- a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty bad for you."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes.

And she, kind of, knew what I was doing. She asked me to, like, to promise her of no alcohol, no drugs. Then I'll pick you up by 12:00. And I-I was surprised. 12:00-12:00, that's basically when the party starts, but I told her whatever-- I thought- I thought to myself that I'll-I'll come-- I'll figure out to delay her, can you pick me up later? So later, so she-- I promised that-- She dropped me off, I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So I-- we go, I have fun like I've been having. And I was drinking. And then the time- the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon-- I couldn't delay her from picking me up. And as soon as she picked me up, and I stepped in the car, she said, \"You drank vodka.\" And I'm like, I-I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor.

What do you like about drinking?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It-It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not when- not when I'm dealing with sports or like-- you know, like a social environment. I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious, I would say. And when I- when I drink, I feel, I don't know, like, it relaxes me. I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily.

So is there anything else that you like about it?"}, {"instruction": "Let me think. Well, I just enjoy it. I think it's, uh-- it's not good for me, I know, but I'm so used to smoking.

What would you be willing to do to prevent going to detox again and getting suspended?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I- I guess the easy one is I wouldn't- I wouldn't drink so much and I try to avoid situations where I'm more-more likely to get in trouble.

So we're-- You know what? Um, it sounds like you actually have some pretty good ideas about, um, how to handle this, and yet kids are-- I know kids-- actually, adults can be really mean too.

And, um, so you'd be willing to come back and talk about it then? Okay. All right.

The freshman and sophomore year, you know."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "But, um, anyway, I think you are hanging in there beautifully, and I love hearing that you're involved in swimming and some other things 'cause they must help connect you up with some pretty-- I would hope-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "- people.

I wanna do something about it."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I mean what do you think that next step is?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.

Um, okay. Um, well let's, uh, let's just have a look shall we? See what's going on. You just wanna open your mouth for me. Say ah."}, {"instruction": "Ah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Right. Uh, to be honest, you know, looking there, it just looks like one of those viruses that are going around at the moment that are causing these sore throats. So, uh, I think that we should just perhaps go for a bit of paracetamol and, uh, some fluids and let nature sort it out."}, {"instruction": "I've been sat here for half an hour. Do you not want to know a little bit more about it, or? I mean, it- it's really painful. I- I've barely been able to swallow today and I'm so worried about passing things on to the kids. Um\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Well, I mean, I'm sorry we're a bit late, but you know that's the general practice, isn't it? You know, sometimes these things happen. Um, but it doesn't alter the fact that you do just have a virus, uh, and they are very common. And the nice thing is that it will get better with paracetamol and fluids, and the paracetamol will help the pain. Um, with giving it to the kids, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that. It's unlikely they'll get it, but I can't guarantee it."}, {"instruction": " Well, I mean, this is gonna affect my job. I talk on the phone quite a lot at work, and I'm just-- I don't think at the moment I'm going to be able to go to work. Can- can I, at least, get a sick note?", "input": "", "output": "Uh, well- well, not really. Uh, you need to self-certify in your first seven days off sick so if you're going to take some time off, just take some paracetamol, lots of fluids, get a self-certified note, uh, in to your employer, and put sore throat there."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't think my employer are gonna take that. I mean, they- they've given us so much hassle at things in the past. I mean, can- can I get a private note? Can- can I ask you to write me a letter, at least?", "input": "", "output": "Uh, well, obviously that's a non-NHS thing so we have to charge you for that and our going rate for that is, uh, \u00a312."}, {"instruction": "Just- it's just not good enough. I just-- ", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I'm sorry. But, you know, if you have just got a sore throat, then there's not much I can do about that. It's just, you know, something that we all get from time to time. Perhaps, what you really need to do is, uh, you know, just take some paracetamol and get some fluids."}, {"instruction": "Parace- paracetamol. Do you understand how difficult this is gonna be for me? I mean, I could lose my job or something.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, that's pretty unlikely with sore throat. I think that's so, you know, a little bit of grand staging there."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, uh, I think I'm gonna say something that I don't- I don't want to, so I'm actually going to go.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Bye."}, {"instruction": "Well, I, um, I did get an interview for a job. Um\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Wow, that's so great."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I wasn't able to go, um, cause my kids, I didn't have any one to watch them. And, um, you know, so the- that was sort of game over. I just, I had to cancel the interview and this, it's too bad because it was a really, a- actually was a job that would have been good, but I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "You sound disappointed."}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah, because it's- it's, you know, I didn't really have a choice. I guess I have to be- I have to make sure my kids are taken care of first. And, um, you know, I'm worried that this is gonna keep happening.", "input": "", "output": "It's gonna keep happening that you have to turn down opportunities."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm, okay. Well, tell me, um, on a scale from one to 10, how important is it for you to get a job?"}, {"instruction": "Um, it sits about at a 10 because yeah, I mean, I'm the only one supporting my kids and, um, you know, it's just, what I'm getting from welfare is just not cutting it. So I really need to have a job and soon.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. You're-you're-you're it."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You have to provide for your children."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Um, and tell me on a scale from one to 10, how confident are you that you could get a job?"}, {"instruction": "I mean, right now, I think I'm about at a three. I just seems like, you know, even if I'm able to get into the interview and get childcare, you know, when I show up, I've got this resume that it's- it's not impressive and it's got all these gaps of employment and I'm not as educated as other people going in for the same job. So I just feel like I'm not, um, I don't know, that employable.", "input": "", "output": "So, it sounds like, you know, the childcare issue has been getting in the way, and so finding something that would work for you would be really helpful."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And then also it sounds like you're kinda feeling not so great about your resume and your experience."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah, because it's so limited and I've been out of the workforce and even when I was working, I mean, it's not, I don't know, it's not stuff that I feel like can lead to the job that I want now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What is it that you- what is it that you want?"}, {"instruction": "I just want something that is- is gonna be steady and where I can be, you know, even if my kids are in childcare during the day, that I can be home every night and spending time with them and, um, know you really like to get something where, um, I'm just making good money and- and I don't have to worry all the time about money.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Yeah. So, if you had- if you had consistent work, it would change your life in a lot of ways."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It would be huge.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. It would provide the income that you need and you wouldn't worry so much."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And it'd be nice to just know what I'm doing and just have my routine.", "input": "", "output": "Right. So every day you know where you're going."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And you know, what's- what's happening for the- for the day, for the week."}, {"instruction": "Right. Well, it would be good if I knew, you know, that my kids are taken care of too-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "- so I'm not worried about them while I'm at work.", "input": "", "output": "Right. Yeah. Because you're- you're the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well."}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Um, so tell me, what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence, to feel a little bit more confident about getting work?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I mean, being able to make the interviews would be the priority.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Um, so chi- you know, taking care, having some childcare, having-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "- having someone I trust that I can call when I know I've got an interview.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Because you definitely need to go to an interview in order to get the job."}, {"instruction": "Right. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So having taken care of that part, having some reliable childcare would definitely help."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "What else would get you to a five?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I just wish that I had- I had more experience or, um, you know, more education. It seems like everyone's got a college education and I don't have that on my resume.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I get asked about education and training and \u2013", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "- um, you know, I just, it, as soon as I asked about it, I just feel just like I'm not good enough-", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "- since I don't have that.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, so if you had something on your resume that was around education training, maybe a certificate of some kind of a field that you're interested in, that you would feel proud of yourself."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, something I could talk about in the interview too. You know, even if I was some type of certification where I could say, I could, you know, with confidence talk about- about that.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Okay. What-- do you have any ideas as to what fields you might be interested in getting some more education, more training?"}, {"instruction": "I mean, I guess, I just don't really know what it's gonna be because I need to have a job now so I'm not really sure.", "input": "", "output": "Like what's going to be fastest."}, {"instruction": "Right. I almost feel like that's more important than what I'm interested in, you know, because I'm like, I'm not going to go back to school for four years right now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, and so if- if you were, it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd wanna to do something really quickly like a short- a short certificate."}, {"instruction": "Yeah or something-- yeah, something that I could get immediate skills that would, you know, get me into some kind of a job now, even if it's not my long-term goal or, you know, career just- just get me into something and then I can always focus on.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, sort of like a short-term or transition into something else."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Great. Exactly.", "input": "", "output": "But that would be steady and pays well?"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, and allow you to afford everything you need to afford."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, because even those jobs right now don't feel accessible for me. They seem like, you know-- seems like if-- maybe if I were better on the computer or you know.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so specifically getting some computer skills will help?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I think so- I think so because I don't-- I can't-- I don't really have anything on my resume that talks about\u2014", "input": "", "output": "The technology."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Okay. So whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right now and you really need the money and you really need to take care of your children and it sounds like you have some ideas as to how you could get to these interviews for one, and then once you're there at the interview, feeling more confident about your skills, um, getting some child-- reliable child care certainly sounds very important."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Um, as well as maybe doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes and training in computers?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that would be great.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "That would be great.", "input": "", "output": "So what would you like to do next, you think?"}, {"instruction": "Well, find the childcare resources-", "input": "", "output": "Okay, okay."}, {"instruction": "- is- seems to be- that seems to be the\u2014", "input": "", "output": "That's a priority."}, {"instruction": "The priority 'cause I can't even do an interview without that.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "And then, um, I mean-- I guess getting into some type of- some type of a training program that's, you know, short-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "- like maybe there's a weekend, I mean\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm glad we figured that out and I think you'll feel better over the next few days."}, {"instruction": "Oh, thanks so much doctor. I'll just take it easy for a couple of days.", "input": "", "output": "Well, since I have you here and we still have a few minutes left, I'd like to bring up another topic. I noticed that your blood pressure and your weight have been climbing a bit over the past few years. We haven't really had time to talk about this much before and I may be able to offer some useful strategies. Would it be okay if we discussed weight and health for a few minutes?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I suppose. I know my weight is a problem, but every time I try to take it off, I end up gaining it back. I don't know what to do.", "input": "", "output": "I know how you feel. Managing weight can be frustrating. Maybe we can just start trying to figure it out together and I'll be here to help you through the challenges."}, {"instruction": "Okay, thank you doctor, but I'm just concerned about how I can possibly lose weight now since work is so busy and the kids take up so much of my time.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, that's certainly understandable. We both know that there's a lot that plays into weight management, but there's no need to figure it all out today, especially since things are so busy for you right now. Maybe we could put our heads together and think about something small that fits reasonably into your life and then we can take further steps when you're ready."}, {"instruction": "Okay, that sounds great. So, what should I do?", "input": "", "output": "Well, let's see. One of the things that's involved in managing weight and health is being active. Physical activity benefits the whole body. It's healthy for our joints, our stress levels, and especially for weight management. Perhaps we could talk about some ways of adding activity that fit into your life."}, {"instruction": "I knew you were gonna say that, but I don't have time in my schedule. I can't afford to take an hour to go to the gym every day.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I understand that. I don't have an hour to go to the gym every day either, but one of the great things about physical activity is that any amount in any type of activity can be very helpful. For example, let's think about some activities that you enjoy doing."}, {"instruction": "I like to walk.", "input": "", "output": "Me too. Walking is great exercise."}, {"instruction": "Wait a minute, isn't walking too mild to help you lose weight, though?", "input": "", "output": "Actually, even just a few minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have time to do even more, that's great. Walking is also great because you can do it anywhere, it doesn't need to be at the gym."}, {"instruction": "Oh, wow, that sounds good. You know what? Come to think of it, I have some time before I have to go back to work and I saw a nice park on the way over here, maybe I can take a short walk after this appointment.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds great."}, {"instruction": "And you know what? I used to really love to dance, but I haven't done that in such a long time.", "input": "", "output": "Well, dancing is a great exercise, especially because it's fun."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. And I know my family would support me if I could just find some place where I can go dancing.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, that's great to hear that your family is so supportive. And I bet there's a dance class somewhere around where you live or maybe even a dance fitness class at the gym."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and you know what? I really like to try that.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to do some research on this and give it a shot?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, I really would. I'm kind of excited about it. What else you got?", "input": "", "output": "Well, small steps can go a long way.

I'll see you soon"}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions.

I'm on his command, almost.", "input": "", "output": "Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.", "input": "", "output": "So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You go for this checkup with the doctor.

We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved."}, {"instruction": "A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-", "input": "", "output": "Mm."}, {"instruction": "-if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?", "input": "", "output": "Correct. Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Also, it's\u2014", "input": "", "output": "But it's not inevitable."}, {"instruction": "Right. Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you.

Other things you've."}, {"instruction": "To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.", "input": "", "output": "That makes a bit of sense."}, {"instruction": "And why go any further, it's there?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Can't help it.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.", "input": "", "output": "They managed with it."}, {"instruction": "Relatives relatively went into their 70s.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes."}, {"instruction": "Well.", "input": "", "output": "If that would help."}, {"instruction": "If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin."}, {"instruction": "I've heard of it yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body."}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system."}, {"instruction": "Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?", "input": "", "output": "You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.", "input": "", "output": "That's right."}, {"instruction": "So insulin you-you.", "input": "", "output": "Kind of, as your."}, {"instruction": "You have yourself draws bar.", "input": "", "output": "Yap."}, {"instruction": "Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?", "input": "", "output": "That's a good way to think."}, {"instruction": "Is that what happened?", "input": "", "output": "Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that."}, {"instruction": "Why?", "input": "", "output": "And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system."}, {"instruction": "Right. Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?"}, {"instruction": "You mean, personally?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "As you get older.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.", "input": "", "output": "A slightly more sedate lifestyle."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, absolutely. You just do.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, \"You've got diabetes 2,\" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I mean.", "input": "", "output": "What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Um, I haven't noticed.", "input": "", "output": "Mh-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.", "input": "", "output": "So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality."}, {"instruction": "Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, Mh-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Um, more than I would normally.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "But that would be, that would be about it.", "input": "", "output": "Mh-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.", "input": "", "output": "You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.", "input": "", "output": "Mh-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Um.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "But maybe I-maybe I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, a bit of a mystery there."}, {"instruction": "I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.", "input": "", "output": "Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.", "input": "", "output": "From your perspective, things are going well?"}, {"instruction": "My life is great, and then you turn around and say, \"Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. It doesn't fit."}, {"instruction": "And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?", "input": "", "output": "Mh-hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. When you get uh, a headache."}, {"instruction": "For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Um.", "input": "", "output": "So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--"}, {"instruction": "Come on, you know.", "input": "", "output": "And you know that's a bit too-"}, {"instruction": "Well, life is too short.", "input": "", "output": "Too much."}, {"instruction": "You know it's the truth.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Okay."}, {"instruction": "I mean you know\u2014", "input": "", "output": "And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?"}, {"instruction": "Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.", "input": "", "output": "Mh-hmm."}, {"instruction": "Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.", "input": "", "output": "So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, yeah."}, {"instruction": "And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, \"Hmm, I use d to have this.\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Yeah, yeah."}, {"instruction": "And you think, \" This is nice food, \" isn't it? and you know.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.", "input": "", "output": "And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go."}, {"instruction": "Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best."}, {"instruction": "Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Maybe I'm just\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "-or Kentucky Fried or whatever.", "input": "", "output": "Very appealing, isn't it?"}, {"instruction": "You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "-for ages.", "input": "", "output": "They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.", "input": "", "output": "So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-"}, {"instruction": "Well\u2014", "input": "", "output": "-when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day.

I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, \"I'll cut this out.\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it.

I sort of\u2014", "input": "", "output": "So you've made our decision to do that?"}, {"instruction": "it-it-it's-- you know, she will, \"Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?\" But I don't want to.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um\u2014", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "So you say, \"Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. ", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.", "input": "", "output": "But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So we cut that down as I say.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.", "input": "", "output": "You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, \"I went to the doctor.\" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup."}, {"instruction": "No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, \"I'm going for my annual, you know-", "input": "", "output": "MIT."}, {"instruction": "-warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know.

They're still cigars and they're still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarette, so it's really important."}, {"instruction": "Well, I only use them just to relax. I mean, it's not like it's something that I would smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day, I mean, I only do it when we go out.", "input": "", "output": "Uh-huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that, so that's good, but it's still causing a lot of problems. And as I said, I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth, you're causing some serious damage, and this needs to stop. Have you thought about quitting?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't really know I'd started.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking, just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars.", "input": "", "output": "So you're gonna quit then?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, maybe.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth, you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's something that I'll have to think about.", "input": "", "output": "What's there to think about?  You said it's not that something you do all that often, and there's all these negative side effects, there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it that often. And so I probably could cut back.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, well, that's a good start, but cutting back isn't going to do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from- from being at risk for these other diseases. But as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't believe that they are cigars. And what I do believe is that it's a choice and it's my right, and it's something that I choose to do. And so I will think about cutting back, but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that. And I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real.", "input": "", "output": "You're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually, it can cause problems with your teeth too. I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use, whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chew, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it. This is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice, but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's something that I'll think about.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something that I'm gonna continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change."}, {"instruction": "Well, I think, um, like when I was really active in the past, I enjoy going to the gym and I like that regardless of what's happening with the weather outside, that-that's always an option. Um, so I've kind of already started to look and see, like, how much gym memberships cost in the area. Um, I really like one that's like month to month and doesn't require me to pay out for like a year because, in the summertime, I just don't use that when the weather is nice, I like to be outside.", "input": "", "output": "So, um, I do think that that would be an option. Um, I did enjoy doing yoga in the past. I, um, I don't care for swimming, uh, because it requires a lot of extra prep time, and like, I don't- chlorine in my hair just doesn't really go very well usually. Um, but I really like walking, um, weightlifting, running is okay. Um, that was more at my, like, peak activity level, so I don't think I could start out running now, but I'd like to work up to it."}, {"instruction": "So, um, I do think that that would be an option. Um, I did enjoy doing yoga in the past. I, um, I don't care for swimming, uh, because it requires a lot of extra prep time, and like, I don't- chlorine in my hair just doesn't really go very well usually. Um, but I really like walking, um, weightlifting, running is okay. Um, that was more at my, like, peak activity level, so I don't think I could start out running now, but I'd like to work up to it.", "input": "", "output": "Great. It sounds like there are a lot of activities that you do like-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-and I'm hearing a theme of climate control,  being important to you and you've already been researching gyms."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me more about that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. So I just- on my phone, if I'm like in the grocery store, I'm kind of just looking through, and on Google, I'll type in like \"Gyms in the area\" and I'll look and see what's there. And, um, I don't ever want to sign up to learn more 'cause I feel like then they just keep emailing you forever. So at this point, I'm just trying to kind of figure out what I can, based on their website as far as cost goes, but that, um, month to month is kind of really important for me. Just like I mentioned, I don't want to be paying for six months or a year out.", "input": "", "output": "Right. Okay. So you're looking for some-something that's reasonably priced-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-and that you don't have to sign a contract and you're right. It's hard to tell what the cost is just from looking on the website."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And I completely agree about wanting to avoid the sales pitch-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-um, element of it. What seems like a logical next step based on-- You've kind of already gotten the ball rolling. What feels like a logical next step?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think, um, you know, I've kind of looked around and seen what I- what's available to me. Um, I think the next step would be to maybe go visit one place and just see, like, what equipment they have. Um, I also think too, I'd like to be outside when the weather permits. I like to walk. I just- I don't like rain or snow or cold, like, um, I don't like doing things when I'm just not in a climate that's enjoyable. So if there is, uh, decent weather, I think going outside and, you know, getting some steps in or just walking would be a good first start for me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So maybe visiting a gym and then also choosing a non-gym activity to sort of get started when the weather's permitting."}, {"instruction": "Right. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "I have one, um, idea that is jumping into my mind as you're talking. Is it okay if I share that?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "I'm wondering about the price of the YMCA compared to other gyms. Uh, is that one that you have an interest in or have looked at already?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know that I've looked closely at that. I don't know much about their pricing or anything like that.", "input": "", "output": "Yes. And honestly, I don't either.  I just suspect that it might be slightly cheaper than some of the more private gyms."}, {"instruction": "I agree.", "input": "", "output": "So something to look into if you're interested."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, definitely.", "input": "", "output": "And they-- I would suspect they'd be less sales pitch-oriented than a private gym. So it might be a safe place to explore first-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-and to build some confidence in that conversation."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, no, yeah. That's a good-good recommendation. I'll definitely check it out.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Great. So, um, in addition to exploring the gym possibility, what sounds like a logical next step for a non-gym activity to get started, some small goal that feels doable, um, and you have control over because it doesn't require the perfect weather-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-or the perfect gym?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I think, you know, finding ways to walk more would be good, um, even if that is inside somewhere. Uh, I've done the like trick of parking in the back of the parking lot and walking up to the store. Um, and like I've also been in Target and taken an extra lap, which is kind of dangerous too 'cause you might spend more money. Um, but I- I think if the weather's nice too, I would like to get outside and try to find a place to walk. Um, and two, I really did enjoy yoga, it's- it was good for my, like, flexibility and posture, and so I would be interested in maybe seeing too what classes are available in the area. I haven't looked at that at all.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So exploring some yoga classes. Is-is doing yoga in your living room appealing to you at all?"}, {"instruction": "Home workouts have never really worked for me in the past just because there's so many distractions, and I can, like, set the mat out there and everything and get everything ready, like bottled water, everything's good to go. And then it just sits there and I don't actually do it, whereas if I go somewhere else, I'm already there. And so I'm doing it.", "input": "", "output": "That's great. It's important to know this about yourself, what works, and what doesn't work, and what you feel motivated to do. So, it sounds like we sort of have two small goals right now. One is to maybe visit the YMCA and-and find out how much that costs-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-and the other goal being maybe just a walk, um, one time between now and the next time I see you. Um, and I say one time, you can, of course, go more than that, but just with snow in the forecast, it might be reasonable to start with a small goal like that and go for one nice day between now and a few weeks from now when I get to see you again. How do those two goals sound?"}, {"instruction": "No, that sounds good. I-I definitely think, um, I'll walk probably more than one time in the next couple of weeks, but, um, I also have this app on my phone that tracks my steps, uh, and it was like built into the phone. It's nothing I downloaded or anything. So I can also use that to kind of see if I'm getting more active 'cause right now I think I'm averaging like 2,000 steps a day, so it's like a lot of sitting.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So you'd like to kind of get motivated with- with the use of an app and that might help you get started."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think so.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, fantastic. So, on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being really confident, I can research a gym and go for one walk, and zero being not at all confident, how are you feeling about these two small goals?"}, {"instruction": "I think I'm at a 10.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I think that, like I said, I think I'll find ways to walk. Um, and I'm at a point now where I've done as much research, I've found out as much information, I think, as I can on the gyms that are local here. Um, but I will check out the- the Y to see if it maybe is a bit cheaper and also a bit more, like, welcoming and doesn't require a- like, a six-month contract or anything like that. So I feel like those would both be good starts. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Wonderful. Are there any other barriers that would be helpful to sort of talk through?"}, {"instruction": "Um, well, if I'm trying to walk outside, the weather's always going to be one, but I, again, like I said, if I'm checking, uh, using the app on my phone to see my step count, I can maybe make more of a priority to walk indoors, um, and just find places inside that I could walk, even if it's just around the hallway or whatever that looks like-", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So being creative with your indoor space is a-is a solution you've come up with yourself for - f there just aren't any good days, nice days outside."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but hopefully there's one. So, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Great. Well, you came in today feeling pretty discouraged about your energy levels and your mood and, um, feeling lousy about your body in general. And, uh, today we've talked about a small-small step to get started and you're hoping to experience some mood boost and some energy as you get rolling here. Um, how are you feeling about today's session?"}, {"instruction": "No, I feel really good. I think even coming in, I didn't have a like step-by-step idea of what I wanted to do next, but no, this has been helpful to know what those small steps are, and like you said, hopefully, I do start feeling better. Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Great. Well, I look forward to checking in with you, and thanks so much for coming in."}, {"instruction": "Thanks for having me. All right.", "input": "", "output": "The baby was up all night and I'm exhausted."}, {"instruction": "The baby was up all night and I'm exhausted.", "input": "", "output": "So, what you're saying is you've had a rough night?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. She was up every three hours to eat, I don't understand it.", "input": "", "output": "So, she needed to eat every three hours last night and that was really frustrating for you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. My mom told me that I started sleeping through the night when I was a month old, Lilly is six weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So, based on what your mom told you, you were expecting Lilly at this point to be sleeping through the night?"}, {"instruction": "Well, what is normal for a baby this age?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Kaylie. It looks like you're here to pick up a prescription today."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. My doctor said he called something in.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. It looks like cholesterol statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take the medication?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.", "input": "", "output": "Well, you just take it once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Well, some of the common ones are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe ones like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, just call your doctor."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Um, why am I taking this medication?", "input": "", "output": "It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh yeah, just one tablet a day. Do you have any questions for me?"}, {"instruction": "No, I guess not.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Great. Have a good day."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. My doctor said he called something in.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, it looks like he called in cholesterol statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take this medication?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, you take this one once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Well, some of the common side effects are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe side effects like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic, cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, you should call your doctor."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Um, so why am I taking this medication?", "input": "", "output": "It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh, and you should take one every day. Do you have any questions for me?"}, {"instruction": "I guess not.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Great. Well, have a good afternoon."}, {"instruction": "Sure. I'm just getting a few groceries.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What did the doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol, and that I should start taking this.", "input": "", "output": "He's right. This medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol, and that means that it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?"}, {"instruction": "He didn't really tell me. He just phoned it in.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When do you normally take your medications?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I take all of my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could take it then.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. That's perfect because cholesterol statin works best if it's taken at night, though you can take it any time of the day. And you should take it every single day. It's important to keep that up. Where do you store your medications?"}, {"instruction": "I store my medications, uh, in my nightstand, right by my bed.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Do you have any children in your home?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, then that sounds like a perfect location for you. Medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture. What did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?"}, {"instruction": "He didn't mention anything about that.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication."}, {"instruction": "Sure. I'm just gonna take one tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications. And I guess I will switched to orange juice. And if I notice any muscle pain that is severe, I'll call Dr. Ferris right away.", "input": "", "output": "Great, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What other questions do you have for me?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I think you answered all my questions. Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Fantastic. All right. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled for you every- at the same time every month. And if you have any other questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day."}, {"instruction": "Sure. I'm just getting a few groceries.", "input": "", "output": "All right.

When do you usually take your medications?"}, {"instruction": "I take all my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could take it then.", "input": "", "output": "That's perfect. This medication can be taken any time of the day, but it does work best if taken in the evening, and it's important to take it every day."}, {"instruction": "I store them all in the nightstand by my bed.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have children in your house?"}, {"instruction": "No. I don't have any kids.", "input": "", "output": "All right.

What questions do you still have for me?"}, {"instruction": "I think you answered all my questions. Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "All right, good. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on autofill for you so it'll be ready at the same time every month for you. And if you have any questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm. Um, yeah, my asthma has just been out of control lately and my doctor says that might be connected to Oscar.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So, what- can you let me know or-or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I've got allergy testing. It's just, uh, the dust makes it bad. I thought the smoking was the main thing-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-that's cut down. Um, and then they said the drinking might contribute to it, too. So, I got a lot of different things I'm working on. So that's what I know.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "The drinking, the smoking and the dust that I got, the, um, the scratch test for.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "And-and-and that's what I know, and that I take the medicine for it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern?"}, {"instruction": "No, I've had it for-for 12 years and now it's a concern. I don't understand.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Yeah.

You've almost quit smoking."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "You're just down to your last couple of cigarettes-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-and you're not even smoking those in the house."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "So, your house is totally smoke-free."}, {"instruction": "Yes, just that work with the .", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, okay. And you have also thought about cutting back on alcohol."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-and-and I think you mentioned done-done a little bit towards that."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm. I'm a little I'm a couple of down. I used to drink four at night, now I'm down to three at least.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, okay."}, {"instruction": "Uh-huh.", "input": "", "output": "So now almost like that's not good enough, like now you have to, now it's the dog and now-"}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm, what's next, yeah, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-what's next. Right. Okay. So, I mean, there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "-but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar, you know, when he's in the house or-or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him, what happens with your asthma symptoms?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we keep them clean, like he's cleaned. So, all the dander doesn't really make sense, but I have been noticing that sometimes when he comes on the bed or just beside, I wheeze a little bit, but I think it has to do with, um, the hair, the, in my lungs cleaning itself up from the smoking.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "So, I don't know if it's that-that's where I'm confused. I don't know how this could be happening.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.

Can I give you some advice on how you could protect him, even the- even further?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, sure.", "input": "", "output": "So, my sense is that you're smoking and you're minimizing hi-his exposure by not smoking in the same room and smoking near windows. Is that-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-correct?"}, {"instruction": "Exactly.", "input": "", "output": "So what I would recommend then, is to move your smoking outside completely. As a smoker, the ideal situation for a smoker in the house is if their home can be made smoke-free and the smoking is moved entirely outside, especially while he's experiencing this cold."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, you know that sounds okay. While he's sick, I might be able to smoke outside in the next couple days or so, but the thing is, usually I'm craving a cigarette the most when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day. I put Jake to bed, I open up a bottle and I pour myself a glass and I'm finally able to unwind, so, I get a craving for a cigarette, so, I'm not sure long-term I'd be able to smoke outside.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so, what I'm hearing you say is that, it sounds like a feasible short-term plan, not ideal and not comfortable because what you really enjoy is that cigarette with a glass of wine, kicking back up on the sofa and chilling out perhaps while you're watching TV. And to maintain that long-term outside smoking outside in Canadian winters where it's cold and snowy, not realistic."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, exactly and another thing is that sometimes in the morning, after I've had a couple of glasses of wine, I kinda feel tired or groggy or low on energy, so, even that I'm not sure is completely relaxing. Especially if I've had a cigarette the night before, I always feel so bad.", "input": "", "output": "So, on the one hand I'm hearing smoking and drinking at night as a way to chill out but at the same time the next day, you're not feeling so great."}, {"instruction": "Exactly.", "input": "", "output": "Would it be helpful to give you some information on low risk drinking guidelines?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I've never heard of them.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, Hailey, what they suggest is that women don't have more than one to two standard drinks a day or a total of nine standard drinks in a week. How does that fit for you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, usually I'm having more than two glasses but if you're saying that's gonna minimize some risk and I guess some of the grogginess I'm feeling the next morning, then maybe I should just try and have one glass of wine in the evenings?", "input": "", "output": "So, it sounds like you'd be open to reducing as a way to still enjoy the wine but perhaps alleviate the way you feel in the morning, some of the hangover effects that sounds like you're experiencing."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I-I'd absolutely maybe reduce. I'll try my best to reduce, but I'm not sure about the smoking.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, you're gonna try to reduce the drinking, not sure about the smoking, what the plan is but I think we did agree upon earlier that you would move it outside, at least while he's sick?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I think that sounds okay.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay. All right and, um, I guess we'll see you next week for Jake's six-month checkup. Is there anything else we could talk about that might be helpful?"}, {"instruction": "No. I think just talking about it was helpful, you know, and I'm- I'm glad you've given me some information. Maybe just this week I can think about it a little more, you know, I-I feel pretty overwhelmed right now. There's so much to do. My days are pretty full, so, maybe I can just s-sit on it for a week.", "input": "", "output": "Sure, of course, Hailey a-and again I really appreciate your openness and honesty about letting me know what's going on with, you know, the stress levels and coping and drinking. I just had a thought that there's also a good mom's group, we run out of our center. So if you'd like a referral to that or some information, I'd be happy to give you and while you think about it, if you want to, um, talk about this further with one of my colleagues, I'd be happy to make you an appointment."}, {"instruction": "All right. That sounds good. Thanks, Dr.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks, Hailey. We'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Dr. Morrow, I'm so relieved I'm not pregnant.", "input": "", "output": "Huh, you feel like you dodged the bullet."}, {"instruction": "I really feel like I dodged the bullet. That was- that was probably the scariest like two days of my life.", "input": "", "output": "It feels like it was like two days was a year?"}, {"instruction": "Yup.", "input": "", "output": "Ah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it went so slow.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Even just being here today is like minutes ticking by.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "It's really good news.", "input": "", "output": "So what would have happened if you found out that you were pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "I don't even know. I'm-I'm not ready to have a kid. I know that. I know my life is not ready for that step.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. That's a big step and that's not the direction you want to go in right now."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, no.", "input": "", "output": "Would you be open to kind of exploring the idea of birth control and family planning?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't really want to go there. I just-- that sort of stuff just weirds me out. Yeah, I take something fun and just makes it really medical.", "input": "", "output": "Now, it's a discussion you don't really wanna have."}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "At the same time, you have some concerns about the possibility of getting pregnant."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I mean I'm-I'm careful. I do what I can, but I don't wanna take anything for that.", "input": "", "output": "So you found some ways to prevent pregnancy up until-- well, maybe, um, you've been pretty fortunate, and then there is also some times where you feel like, \"Oh, no. What if I didn't dodge the bullet?\""}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's-it's scary. I mean, this is the first time I've ever had that sort of feeling of \"What am I gonna do?\"", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "And-and that fear was like-- yeah. Up until now, I've been good, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, you've been able to kind of avoid any kind of consequences, and right now, you're not feeling that talking about birth control is something on your-your list."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. No, it- it's just- it's just weird for me. I don't- I don't like thinking about that stuff, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Sure. I totally appreciate that, and it's your decision, Olivia. You know yourself best and what fits for you. If you ever feel like you like to open up the idea of conversation about family planning or birth control, I'd love to talk to you about that another time."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, maybe another time. Just, I'm not ready for it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I'm not ready for that conversation right now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I respect that. Thanks though for coming in to see me today."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And I'm glad that this appointment was a positive one for you."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome."}, {"instruction": "Wow. I can't believe he fell asleep after all of that crying, poor guy.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Well, the good news is he doesn't have pneumonia. It's just an upper re-respiratory tract infection and a cold. So there's some things you can do to make- to help him get better. You can avoid excessive dust. You can keep him hydrated, avoid over-the-counter cold remedies. Keep him away from people who have flu or cold-like symptoms and avoid smoke. And the last one should be easy because you quit smoking during your pregnancy."}, {"instruction": "Well, you're right. I-I did quit smoking when I was pregnant, but actually, um, a couple of weeks ago, I went out, my mom was able to take Jake for the night and my friends they were having a birthday party and we had a couple of glasses of wine and it felt like old times. So before I knew it, I was out having a cigarette with them. And since then I've been having a couple of cigarettes a day, you know, just at the end of the day after I put Jake to bed. But that sounds like it has nothing to do with what you're talking about, right?", "input": "", "output": "No, wait a minute. That has everything to do with what we're talking about. I can't believe at the end of this appointment, you're just slipping in the fact that you've resumed smoking again. That's very, very important information for me to know. And I'd like to spend some time talking about it now."}, {"instruction": "Well, I had no idea that it was such a big deal. I-I didn't think it would have anything to do with Jake getting sick or, you know, hurting him.", "input": "", "output": "Come on, Hailey. You're here because you thought he had pneumonia. You're telling me that Jake can't breathe, you're concerned about his breathing. And then you just slip in the fact that you're smoking cigarettes and you think there's no relationship? Do I really need to review all the risks of smoking in front of your-your child or exposing him to secondhand smoke not to mention the risks that you're posing to yourself and your own health?"}, {"instruction": "Well, you know, I-I was doing perfectly well. It was just when I went out with my friends and, you know, usually, I'm fine with the cravings. It's just when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day. And if I have more than two or three, I just get that craving for a cigarette. And if I have cigarettes in the house, it just happens. You know, I'm doing pretty good.", "input": "", "output": "So it sounds like if you have alcohol, then smoking is very difficult to avoid and you know what you need to do. You need to go home and as your-your son's doctor, I need to tell you you need to go home and throw out those cigarettes. You need to quit."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Um, well, yeah, I-I guess I can throw the cigarettes. And tomorrow night when I have my glass of wine, I'll-I'll just try to avoid that craving.", "input": "", "output": "And let's talk some more about wine. You keep throwing wine into the conversation. It sounds like it's become a significant part of your daily routine. How much are you drinking?"}, {"instruction": "Only a couple of drinks a night. You know, it's pretty rare if I have anything more than that. It's just my way of relaxing at the end of the day. It's been so stressful since Jake came along. It's just how I fall asleep at the end of the night.", "input": "", "output": "Well, no one said motherhood was going to be easy, Hailey. So let's talk about these drinks. Are we talking about the-the low-risk drinking guidelines, one to two standard drinks a night or are we talking about a mug of Margarita's?"}, {"instruction": "Well.", "input": "", "output": "What are you drinking? What's the quantity that you're drinking."}, {"instruction": "I guess about- I have about a half a glass a night and maybe two. Very rarely I'll have more than that. You know, it just helps me kind of relax.", "input": "", "output": "There's other ways to relax. There's yoga. There's deep breathing. You need to stop raising the roof and raise your kid. This is not okay. You're not just worrying about Hailey anymore. It's Hailey and Jake. You're a mom now."}, {"instruction": "I didn't know it was such a big deal. I-I never thought that there would be any impacts on Jake because of it.", "input": "", "output": "I'm trying not to be hard on you, Hailey, but I've got to tell you as a position, it's a very big deal. Your drinking and your tobacco use are red flags for me and they need to stop immediately. So we've already talked about your plan for smoking. You're going home. You're throwing out your cigarettes. You're putting on the patches. What's the plan for the alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I'll do the same thing. I'll go home and throw out the bottles of wine and stop having a glass at the end of the day.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds good. And if you need to relax, go for a walk, join a moms group, read a book. How about you come back in a week when we have Jake's six months checkup and you can let me know how that quit plan is going."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll try my best.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks."}, {"instruction": "Good morning.", "input": "", "output": "What have you got in mind, what do you want from us?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I need some medication if you can offer me some.", "input": "", "output": "Absolutely, we're in the right place for that."}, {"instruction": "And, uh, whatever else you can do just to get me to go smoke-free.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, just remind me again why it is you want to stop."}, {"instruction": "It's, uh, just these days-- I think these days I'm-I'm finding that, um, I'm smoking 20, 30 a day, I'm getting sick of it. It's, you know, I've seen my friends have stopped smoking too and it's kind of they're looking at me weird these days like I'm the only one left who's still smoking.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, good, and so feeling under pressure here."}, {"instruction": "Especially the other night I was at the restaurant, it was a bit-- you know, it was a bit embarrassing I'm the only one walk walking out.", "input": "", "output": "And so that-that can't feel a little uncomfortable being by yourself. So that sounds like one of the reasons you have to quit is it's a little getting smelly and it's getting embarrassing."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Any other reasons?"}, {"instruction": "Um, it's expensive these days.", "input": "", "output": "How much does it actually cost you a week?"}, {"instruction": "It's-it's about-- Um, I'll buy and go through a pack a day, so it's almost \u00a37.", "input": "", "output": "\u00a37 a week or a day?"}, {"instruction": "\u00a37 a day today, so-", "input": "", "output": "So your pack a day\u2014"}, {"instruction": "-you're talking about \u00a340, uh\u2014", "input": "", "output": "\u00a350 a week."}, {"instruction": "\u00a350 a week.", "input": "", "output": "Even more mess, you see."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So we're talking about spending \u00a350 a week-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-being one of the few left smoking in your crowd, and not liking the smell. That sounds like three reasons."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Great, okay. So have you got a date in mind when you'd like to stop smoking?"}, {"instruction": "Well, what you do-- What do you suggest?", "input": "", "output": "Generally, it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "What are the main reasons why you actually smoke? What do you enjoy most about it?"}, {"instruction": "Um, it's just entertainment. Something, um, when I bored, it's got-- I've got-- I smoke-", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "-or sometimes I go out, but as I said, I'm the only one kind of outside.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What do you think you'll miss most about it?"}, {"instruction": "The-- Um, it takes away a lot of my stresses.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm, what sort of stresses?"}, {"instruction": "Just, uh, when I- when I go down, uh, for-for a break at work.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "I never go down, I just need a break away from it all, just shut off. So, uh, I-I really enjoyed that. The cigarette just helps me calm down.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. And what is your favorite cigarette of the day?"}, {"instruction": "It's definitely the one at the end of the evening.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so the end of the day-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-the thing that helps you just unwind, put an end to the work section and move into your own time."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So after you've had the quit date, what do you think you might do when it it's the first day at work and it's time to go home if you're not gonna have a cigarette?"}, {"instruction": "I guess, um, I'll just- I'll just have, you know, some fresh air as well, but this time without a cigarette in my hand but to try and give myself regular breaks maybe, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "It's one of those tough things.", "input": "", "output": "Have you managed to stop smoking in the past?"}, {"instruction": "I've managed for a couple of weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And what got you back?"}, {"instruction": "It was, um-- To be honest, it was stress from an argument with my partner I remember.", "input": "", "output": "So something just happened-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-so it took you back into it. All right. Let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here. You really want to stop smoking because you're kind of the last guy in your group still smoking, it costs a lot of money, and you don't really like the smell."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "The main reason that you smoke is because, at the end of the day, it gives you a kind of relaxation, and if there's quite a little stress that's going on which you're using cigarettes to help you cope with."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "What you'd like to do is stop and you'd like to sort of like choose a time to quit when it's going to be there's not as much stress around as possible. When do you think would be a good time for you to choose to be your quit date?"}, {"instruction": "I guess, um, at the weekend I've got a party coming up.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "So, uh, maybe Monday morning.", "input": "", "output": "So Monday morning after the party will be a good day, and that's next week. Okay. Now, one of the things that we do in the pharmacy is recommend that you use medication to help you. You know this increases your chance of success and it makes it more likely that can manage any cravings that come along. A lot of people like using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches, gum, you've probably seen people using any of these products. And other options are tablets which you can get from the GP."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "So, yeah, again-- Um, so have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through managing the cravings?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I'm thinking, um, one of these patches.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So a patch is something you've already seen, and-"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "-and, again, I'll get some out and I'll show you what they look like. This course of medication lasts for 10 to 12 weeks. And we strongly recommend that people stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success. Stopping smoking is not easy but it's possible and with the type of support that we offer here in the pharmacy, you absolutely make your chance of success four times greater than trying on your own, so, that's why it's really good that you've come to see me. Now, what you said is you really want to do it and that next week sounds like a good day for you to start because the party is over and done with."}, {"instruction": "Mm-hmm.", "input": "", "output": "You've got the time at the end of the day when you finish work, which might be the first time you've gone without a cigarette. So, what I'd like to recommend is that you use two products perhaps and I'm thinking of you're having a patch and then suggesting that you might use something that you can top up with. Often, a person who smokes knows exactly what it feels like when they're craving for a cigarette. What does it feel like to you, when you can't have a cigarette and you want one?"}, {"instruction": "I just get irritable.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happening to you."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "So, I would strongly recommend that you have the patch. I'll talk to you about how to use that and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation are coming up, particularly in that first week."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "So, you're happy with the date for ?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, absolutely.", "input": "", "output": "Okay and would you like to come back and see me again?"}, {"instruction": "Well, definitely.", "input": "", "output": "And what would you like me to do if you don't come back?"}, {"instruction": "A nice phone call.", "input": "", "output": "I'd be very happy to do that."}, {"instruction": "Well, I suppose you're gonna give me a row and tell me it's all self-inflicted and I've got to change my ways and give up the things I enjoy.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I'm not going to do that because you're the boss. It's up to you what you want to do with you about your own health."}, {"instruction": "The doc said I've got to take pills for the rest of my life.", "input": "", "output": "You don't seem too happy about that."}, {"instruction": "Well, I feel fine, but the-the doc said it could save my life.", "input": "", "output": "Well, there's a lot of things you can do yourself that will improve the situation as well. So what we can do today is wee up some of those things, smoking, diet, exercise, weight, loss, all those kinds of things. So we're just gonna start and see how you feel as we go."}, {"instruction": "Okay, what should I do first?", "input": "", "output": "Well, it's very much up to you, you're the boss of your own life. Where would you like to start?"}, {"instruction": "Where do you think I should start?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I could give you my opinion. Um, and I can give you lots of information, but I think you know the score pretty well. And I think you'd know what I would say."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, uh, you tell me, stop smoking and lose weight and take more exercise, wouldn\u2019t you?", "input": "", "output": "Absolutely. Spot on. So stopping smoking would have a huge impact, that would have a big impact very early on. Losing weight would also have a big impact because that would help with your blood pressure, your cholesterol, and also lower your diabetes risk. So what-what'd you think about those things? Uh,"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I loved to lose weight but it's so hard giving up the things you enjoy.", "input": "", "output": "It\u2019s really tough. It's hard to know where to start, isn't it?"}, {"instruction": "I really should do. Or shouldn't I,", "input": "", "output": "How important is it for you then to lose weight?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'd like to see my children settled and my grandchildren growing up and I should,suppose I should be an example to them.", "input": "", "output": "So can it be in there for your-your family's important to you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I want to be there for them, but not a burden to them.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So w-where do you think you can start with that?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I've been thinking about them a lot lately, and I want to be there for them. So have to do what I need to, to improve my health.", "input": "", "output": "What's kind of the first thing you might think about doing?"}, {"instruction": "You know, to start with, I could cut down on my drinking. Um, that's adding to my weight and to my blood pressure, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. That would be a really good place to start, mm-hmm."}, {"instruction": "In fact, I think I'll try and cut out the booze altogether. My wife says I drink too much at the weekends.", "input": "", "output": "So I think it should be really supportive of that then."}, {"instruction": "And I suppose I could cut out the crisps and pies at works.", "input": "", "output": "So what would you do to make sure you didn't get hungry at work?"}, {"instruction": "I'm gonna start having soup at lunchtime. I suppose a big bowl of soup would be far better than two pies.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Well, a big bowl of vegetable soup. You could probably count that as one or maybe even two of your five a day. So it'd be a really good place to start. Anything else you could think about doing?"}, {"instruction": "Well, there's one, one thing uh, I've done already, I've stopped adding salt to my food. The doc said that would help with my blood pressure.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's good. That's probably benefited you already. And the other thing you might not be aware of is that salt intake is linked to loss of calcium from our bones, which makes the bones more fragile. So reducing your salt intake will really help with that too."}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't know that. Um, it's good to know. I'll tell my wife, um, she's still very fond of her salt and her mother had osteoporosis.", "input": "", "output": "So well, maybe you can help her as well and that would be good. Well, I think you've got off to a really great start, Mr. Green. You're very well aware of what you-you need to do, and you've obviously thought about it and got some good plans in place. So you're going to reduce your-your alcohol intake, you've already started by reducing your salt intake. Um, perhaps when we meet up next time we could talk a little bit about smoking and exercise as well, when you're ready for that. So how do you feel now?"}, {"instruction": "I feel if I go ahead and do as I say with cutting down on the pies, the crisps, um, and cutting out the booze, I feel I'm making a start but let's take it a step at a time and see how it goes. But, uh, the next day when we look at it, the figures might be a lot better.", "input": "", "output": "That's great. So should we meet up at the same time next week then?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, that\u2019s fine with me.", "input": "", "output": "That\u2019s great. All the very best then."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. You too.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks for coming in today. I guess you've, uh, sat in that seat with lots of people like me in the past."}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. And you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. So today I wanna- be good for us to talk about that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here."}, {"instruction": "Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I\u2014", "input": "", "output": "What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've\u2014"}, {"instruction": "I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal P again.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.", "input": "", "output": "Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about."}, {"instruction": "Mm.", "input": "", "output": "And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about\u2014"}, {"instruction": "Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is.", "input": "", "output": "Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "-the expectation of life on the inside something?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's worse.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So tell me how you've been managing.

I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the , you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, \"Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,\" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young.

You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it."}, {"instruction": "You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?"}, {"instruction": "A little bit that. Yeah, little-little bit tense.

Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "I mean, not like they have been because we've only just started on the new road, but I mean, yeah, tense is the right word.", "input": "", "output": "Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep? So on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. So, in that 'where to go', what ideas have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this Daryl, non-dealing  guy\u2014"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. I haven't got little, um, nuggets of where I could go. I've just got like this feeling that I should go somewhere.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Yep.

No idea.", "input": "", "output": "No idea. Okay. So I'm wondering, you've been in the system a while. You're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?"}, {"instruction": ".", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. So, you know, often at 34, guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and what's important.

He's very good with people.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Really good at talking, and, uh, but anyway, I don't know how he did it.", "input": "", "output": "Cool.

I think he would have found some higher power.

That's why I'm here.", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what that is.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "-thing.

Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "Is it a quality?", "input": "", "output": "I think it is."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'd need some of them.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah?

I could've done that", "input": "", "output": "You could've done that, but you're not. So I'm wondering what's different?

It's not as much fun.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "I used to take the piss outta you guys-", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "-all day long.

The different world is offering me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you know, nothing.

We talked about courage before and you've got the guts to be talking with me about this stuff today, and I'm wondering if you actually do have some courage to think about these ideas.
