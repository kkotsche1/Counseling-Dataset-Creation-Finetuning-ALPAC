I haven't seen a shrink...I mean a therapist in a long time.", "input": "", "output": "It's perfectly natural to be a little nervous your first session. When did you last see a therapist?"}, {"instruction": "I hope you're not offended by me calling you a shrink.", "input": "", "output": "No, that's fine. I've been called worse. When were you last in therapy?"}, {"instruction": "About a year ago. I've been in and out of therapy most of my adult life, since I was about 19 or 20. That's almost a whole decade.", "input": "", "output": "What's going on in your life that leads you to seek therapy now?"}, {"instruction": "Well, work, for one. I hate it. I'm overwhelmed. And I'm having problems at home. Everything sucks, basically. Everything's going to hell in a bucket.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Let's start with work. You say you're overwhelmed?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I'm a one of the secretaries for SII. There are three secretaries assigned to this group of software engineers I work for. We have a major project deadline coming up, the paperwork never seems to end, and they always want constant revisions. I've been working really long days--12, 14, 16 hours, sometimes. I feel like a zombie, one of the walking dead. I'm always exhausted; it's like I'm barely alive.", "input": "", "output": "It must be a drain to work such long hours."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, it's not like I have much of a social life anyway. One of the secretaries in my group is a dud, a real pain in the ass. I get stuck picking up after her all the time.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I mean I know I should be patient with her--she's got some serious problems, but don't we all?", "input": "", "output": "Problems?"}, {"instruction": "I heard her husband is abusive. She's really scatterbrained, she can't retain anything. She makes careless errors and loses things. And what a slob! Everywhere she goes, she leaves a trail of paper, assorted office supplies, used Kleenex, and cough drop wrappers. This woman, Celeste, is so thin and frail you want to feel sorry for her. But I get so pissed off at her, I want to snap her scrawny little neck. My God, I hate the way that sounds. I must sound like an awful person.", "input": "", "output": "You're allowed to feel frustrated and angry."}, {"instruction": "And at home it's even worse. I hate my job, but the thought of coming home is so awful I can't stand it.", "input": "", "output": "What's going on at home?"}, {"instruction": "My landlord is a real asshole. Sorry. He's a jerk. I've got a foul mouth. I think it comes from cursing at my computer all day.", "input": "", "output": "There's no need to apologize. You may speak freely here."}, {"instruction": "Well, I moved into this cheap apartment. I needed to move in a hurry, and it was cheap, and they allowed pets.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of pet do you have?"}, {"instruction": "I have a ferret. They're illegal in California. So I had to find a place that wouldn't mind.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What's its name?"}, {"instruction": "Harriet. She's the highlight of my existence. She's the only thing I look forward to.  Do you want to see?", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  Nice ferret, although she looks a bit out of her element in this picture.  But she's cute."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "I'm just considering getting a kitten myself.  I'm not familiar with the practice of keeping ferrets as pets. It's illegal, you say?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, there's a stupid California law. I'm part of a group that is trying to get the law changed. Ferrets are not vicious animals. They're sweet and affectionate.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feed and care for a ferret, exactly?"}, {"instruction": "Harriet likes cat food. Kitten food, actually. Ferrets eat meat. But she likes all kinds of things. She likes avocados and corn chips. She likes beer, but I don't give her too much.", "input": "", "output": "Harriet sounds like quite a character."}, {"instruction": "She is. She's a sweetheart. Anyway, my landlord and his family have several cats and dogs and lots of kids. I kind of liked the idea of all the animals and kids when I first moved in. Maybe I romanticized the notion of being part of a big family, you know? I realize that most families are dysfunctional in some way, but these people are...well, they're really awful. I should expand my vocabulary, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Please express yourself in the way that's most comfortable for you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, I should buy a thesaurus. I just don't want to sound crude or uneducated, like they do.", "input": "", "output": "They?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, my landlord and his charming family. He and his wife are constantly screaming and cursing at their kids. Listening to them--it's not as though I'm eavesdropping, because they're always yelling at each other--they sound like white trash, worse than the guests on the Jenny Jones show.", "input": "", "output": "The Jenny Jones Show?"}, {"instruction": "That's one of those trashy daytime talk shows. When I get home late from work sometimes, I watch the reruns that come on at one or two in the morning. It helps me unwind.", "input": "", "output": "You're up until one or two in the morning? What time do you get up to go to work?"}, {"instruction": "Around six or so. I don't sleep well, and my landlord's family upstairs make a lot of noise. There's always some kid crying. It's either that or he and his wife are having a shouting match.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Have you always had difficulty sleeping?"}, {"instruction": "Ever since I was a kid. I used to have nightmares all the time. Now, I come home so tense and angry and get so pissed of at my scum bag landlord and his demon children, that I can't sleep. I stay up all night seething. My stomach is always upset, and I've been getting these headaches.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been taking any medication?"}, {"instruction": "I've been taking Zantac for the stomach pain. I take a lot of Tylenol for my headaches. Sometimes, I get backaches and pains in my shoulder and neck. I also take this stuff...it's called Trazodone. I was given a prescription for it a year ago. I only take it when I really need to sleep and I'm too tense to relax. I take them a few times a week.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been taking more of them recently?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes. But I don't take them every day. I only take them when I really need them.", "input": "", "output": "Where did you get this prescription?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's a long story. I guess I should tell you. Um...", "input": "", "output": "Take your time."}, {"instruction": "My company isn't going to find out about this, is it? Can my boss see your files?", "input": "", "output": "No. Everything you tell me is strictly confidential."}, {"instruction": "But SII is paying for this, or at least for part of it, right?

They can see the scars, but they don't know the whole story.", "input": "", "output": "Scars?"}, {"instruction": "I made this clumsy, half-hearted suicide attempt about a year ago. I tried to slash my wrists. I didn't do a very good job. See?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I was pretty fucked up when I cut myself. I'd been drinking and taking Xanax and some other pills. And I'd been doing a lot of drugs even before that.", "input": "", "output": "What was it that led to your suicide attempt?"}, {"instruction": "I broke up with my boyfriend about a month before. The last time I saw him, we got into a really bad fight. I had been doing a lot of speed--methamphetamine, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, he beat the shit out of me. I provoked him--I broke a lot of things around his house. I was so angry, I was doing everything I could to piss him off. I was completely irrational. Anyway, after that night, I couldn't seem to get rid of the anger. I snarled at everyone around me including my boss--who was this really nice guy--and all the people with which I worked. I was such a bitch. I ended up getting fired after getting into an argument with my boss. Afterwards, I cleaned out my desk, drove home, and was completely hysterical. When I got home, I drank as much gin as I could and took every pill in the house. Then, I slashed my wrists.", "input": "", "output": "Did someone find you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, the people downstairs. I left the water running in the bathroom, and the sink overflowed. They banged on the door, but I was so out of it, I didn't hear them. The landlord--my old landlord, not the one I have now--unlocked the door to my apartment and called an ambulance. When I woke up, I was in the hospital.", "input": "", "output": "How long were you there?"}, {"instruction": "One week. I spent a few days in intensive care, then I was sent to the mental ward--\"inpatient psychiatric.\" I stayed there another four days. It seemed like forever. When they released me, they gave me this prescription. I haven't really used it much since.", "input": "", "output": "Did you see a psychiatrist while you were hospitalized?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I saw those goddamn shrinks every fucking day. Oh, sorry.", "input": "", "output": "That's quite all right."}, {"instruction": "I got so sick of being asked all these stupid...all these questions. When I was released, they made me see some quack...uh, I mean counselor at this clinic. I only saw him a few times. He was a real prick.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He was such a flake. I was working downtown for this other company. I wasn't making much money, and I had a lot of bills, including the hospital bill--my insurance only covered part of it. So I worked nights, too. It was really hard for me to take time off to see him. And half the time, he wasn't even there. He'd make appointments and forget them. Or he'd schedule appointments and forget to tell me, and then accuse me of standing him up. Finally, I got fed up with him messing with my head. And I couldn't afford to lose more hours at work. I finally told him to go fuck himself, and I never saw him again. So you see, Doctor Balis, I don't have much of a track record with people in your profession.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you've been through quite an ordeal. It's understandable that you might be apprehensive about entering therapy again."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, I guess it's not fair to think that all shrinks are inherently evil.", "input": "", "output": "I like to think that there are some of us who aren't."}, {"instruction": "I know. I came here, didn't I? I came here because I was at the end of my rope. I felt so helpless. I was afraid I might snap again, like I did last year. I don't want to do that again. I don't want my life to be screwed up any more than it is. And I don't want to go back to the loony bin--back to the psycho ward. It's really hard to be around people who are even crazier than yourself.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I will try to help you, Sharon. I support you in your desire to get better and I think that coming to see me is a very positive step in your effort to get control back over your life.  We have work to do and I'd like to start in earnest next week, okay? Let's see, would this time next week work for you?"}, {"instruction": "What? We're out of time? Jeez. Um, okay. Sure. Yeah, this time would be okay.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Sharon. I know this session went kind of quick, but it will take a while for us to get to know each other.  Can you tell me how you feel after your first session?"}, {"instruction": "I feel okay, kind of relieved. I was so nervous. But I'm glad that I came. At least I got to vent some of my frustrations.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hi.", "input": "", "output": "How are you today?"}, {"instruction": "I'm pissed off.", "input": "", "output": "What's the matter?"}, {"instruction": "I had a really bad week at work. My boss yelled at me in front of the entire department Tuesday, then today, he reprimanded me again in front of everyone. Isn't there some rule of management which says you're not supposed to yell at a person in front of her co-workers?", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "There were some important documents that needed to be sent by messenger. That dumbshit, Celeste--the dingbat secretary I told you about--she screwed it up and put the wrong address on the label. She's done it several times before. These are confidential documents, and the wrong people got them. My boss said the error was mine. When I told him that Celeste made the mistake, he said I should have caught it.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like your boss is very demanding."}, {"instruction": "He is--of me, not of her. He always makes excuses for her. It makes me sick; I am so tired of getting dumped on. I feel like I have \"Welcome\" stamped across my chest.", "input": "", "output": "You feel that you are singled out in some way?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah. I don't think I have a persecution complex or anything. I have a habit of taking on too much responsibility, then resenting it.", "input": "", "output": "Can you give me an example?"}, {"instruction": "In my department, I'm the one who makes sure we meet our deadlines. I'm the one who's supposed to catch mistakes before they reach the client. I'm not the most social person. I don't give good phone, as they say. I hide behind my computer all day and try to avoid talking to people as much as I can. The guys in my department know that I'm productive, that I'll work all night to get a project done if I have to, so they come to me if they need something. Celeste doesn't have a good eye for detail, and she's easily distracted. I'm wondering if she has some kind of learning disability, or Attention Deficit Disorder. Maybe she's senile. Anyway, she's very good with people. Celeste comes off as this kindly old aunt--you know, a nice motherly woman who bakes cookies and always has time to chat. She makes a lot of errors, though, and she forgets things. I get so frustrated. Sometimes I want to smack her in the head with a blunt object.", "input": "", "output": "You sound angry."}, {"instruction": "A few days ago, I snapped at her and made her cry. I was rushing, trying to meet this deadline, and she was like this little kid underfoot. Later that day, my boss called our department together and gave us a patronizing lecture on how we all need to work together as a team, and how not all people have the same abilities. I know it was directed at me, but he had to tell everyone. I was pissed.", "input": "", "output": "I can understand your frustration, but your boss does have a point."}, {"instruction": "I had a feeling you'd take their side.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, it sounds as though you make an effort to be conscientious and productive. But unfortunately, not everyone has your ability, or your skill level."}, {"instruction": "Then Celeste shouldn't be working at SII. It's not some cushy secretarial job. It's very demanding, a lot of work, constant pressure, deadlines to meet. Celeste, or someone like her who is easily distracted and disorganized, doesn't belong here. I know that sounds harsh. There are other companies where she would do just fine. Doesn't Goodwill hire the mentally retarded?", "input": "", "output": "Sharon!"}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay. I just get so frustrated and angry, and I can't stop obsessing about it. There's nothing much I can do, so I should stop thinking about it, right? It doesn't look like they'll be getting rid of any of us any time soon, with all this work we have to do.", "input": "", "output": "You say there are three secretaries for your group?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, there's this other girl, Sherry. She's okay. She's competent and a nice enough person. But six months ago, she had a baby, and now she takes a lot of time off. I have to pick up her work load, too.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I have to keep reminding myself to be patient. It's annoying though. It seems like every other week she's either late, or needs to leave early, or calls in sick. It's always, \"The baby this,\" or \"The baby that.\"", "input": "", "output": "Being a single mother is quite a challenge."}, {"instruction": "I'm glad I can't have kids.", "input": "", "output": "You can't have children?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's highly unlikely. I had this problem a few years ago. I don't really like talking about it. Female trouble, you know?", "input": "", "output": "You don't have to discuss any topic that makes you uncomfortable."}, {"instruction": "I mean, no offense, but you're not my ob/gyn.", "input": "", "output": "No, that's fine. I understand."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, I read that women who have what I had--I had an ovarian cyst, I guess it's not such a big deal. A lot of women have them. I don't know why it bothers me so much to talk about it. I feel like I'm defective or something. It was pretty serious. I let it go for too long. Anyway, there's a pretty good chance that I'm infertile.", "input": "", "output": "Do you like children?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I like other people's kids. I even like my landlord's little monsters. His youngest son likes to come to my apartment and bug me; he's so starved for attention. But women like Sherry, who know better but get knocked up anyway, they really get to me. She's a smart woman, not some teenager. She's a few years older than me. Didn't she realize what she was getting into? And her boyfriend is a real shit. He doesn't support her or the baby at all.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like a difficult situation."}, {"instruction": "It seems to me that single motherhood is a burden on everyone, on all of society. You always hear about how it's so hard for single mothers, how much work they have to do, and how the fathers don't contribute. But these women made a choice. It's not like it was 20 or 30 years ago. Women have access to birth control now, and there are abortion clinics and adoption agencies. There aren't any social programs or special benefits for women in their teens and twenties who don't have children. I've worked with other single mothers, and they are a real pain in the ass--always taking time off, calling in sick. They always say, \"My child comes first.\" No boss will ever challenge a woman on that. But if she cared about her kids so much, why didn't she take steps to insure that they would have a stable home life? Why did she have a child she couldn't afford? And society puts single mothers up on a pedestal. They get special treatment. It's almost as if they're being rewarded for their bad judgment.", "input": "", "output": "You seem very passionate about this."}, {"instruction": "I didn't mean to rant. I don't mean to sound like Dan Quayle. I'm not a Republican. But I've worked with a lot of single moms. I'm usually one of the few single, childless women in the office. I guess I was lucky I never got pregnant. But I would have had an abortion, or given it up for adoption. I don't think single moms should be branded with a scarlet letter. But it seems wrong to encourage them--to say that what they did is okay and life should be made easier for them. Maybe I get so angry because I had such a screwed up home life. I hate to think of kids growing up unwanted, like my landlord's kids. He yells at them constantly. I know their home life must be terrible.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to talk about your own childhood?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "No?"}, {"instruction": "It's not exactly my favorite subject.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It's hard for me to talk about.", "input": "", "output": "We can talk about it when you feel ready. Or not at all, if you prefer."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's just that a shrink I saw about two years ago...he was an intern at a local clinic. He wasn't very experienced. Anyway, I told him a lot of personal stuff. Things that were really painful for me to talk about. I felt like I had to talk about them. That's why you go to a therapist, right? Well I told him, and something about his response...I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Did he respond in a manner that was unprofessional?"}, {"instruction": "He seemed...well, almost dismissive.", "input": "", "output": "Would you feel comfortable giving me an example?"}, {"instruction": "Well, there was this one incident. I used to have nightmares about it. I don't want to go into detail...", "input": "", "output": "That's fine. Just tell me as much as you feel comfortable with."}, {"instruction": "My father came home drunk and...well, he was abusive. Extremely physically abusive. I felt like I had to purge myself. The memories kept coming back. So I told him--my previous shrink--what happened. I told him all the details I remembered. I was in tears, it was so hard for me to talk about. When I was finished, he said, \"So, your father was hitting you and stuff?\" He didn't even pretend to care. He could have at least given me that old therapist's clich\u00e9, \"How does that make you feel?\" He didn't realize that I had just told him one of the worst things that had happened to me. My father was...he was...I don't want to talk about this.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Sharon, that's fine."}, {"instruction": "Maybe I'm making too much of this.", "input": "", "output": "Don't discount your feelings. Memories of an abusive parent can be painful to recount. It sounds as though your other therapist didn't have the experience to respond appropriately."}, {"instruction": "Now I feel I can't ever tell anyone else about it. And I can't stop the memories from coming back. They flood back at the most inopportune times.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel that your last therapist might have turned you off to therapy in general?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, him and the shrinks in the loony bin. I feel stupid now. I wasn't going to tell you. I made up my mind that I wasn't going to tell anyone.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, we have a lot to work through.  I won't lie to you and say that therapy is an easy process, but I certainly hope that you'll come to trust me and give me your confidence. I suggest that all my patients write down their thoughts and feelings, particularly those they find troubling. The journal is just for you, although I'd be happy to read it if you feel like sharing it with me.  You might find it helpful to write down your thoughts and feelings, even your dreams."}, {"instruction": "Dreams?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, do you remember your dreams?"}, {"instruction": "I used to have nightmares. I still do, sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Try keeping a journal for a few weeks. Write in it as often as you like."}, {"instruction": "Do I have to show it to you?", "input": "", "output": "You can if you'd like. That's entirely up to you. If you'd rather not, that's fine also. The journal will help you monitor, review, and express your feelings and emotions. I also encourage my patients to share with me their creative efforts, such as sketches or poetry."}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it.

Does this time next week work for you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, this is fine.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Sure.

Please come on in."}, {"instruction": "God, what time is it?", "input": "", "output": "You're about fifteen minutes late. How did things work out last night?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I called Charlotte--the woman whose cats I used to feed when she and her husband went out of town. I told her what happened. She insisted that I stay with her. She even came with me this morning and helped me get my stuff.", "input": "", "output": "You went back to your apartment?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I called my landlord and told him I would come by early. I called in sick, so don't tell on me, okay? I put Harriet the Ferret in her pet carrier and got some clothes and other stuff. I left a lot of things behind.", "input": "", "output": "Did you get a chance to call an attorney?"}, {"instruction": "Charlotte recommended an attorney, and I called him this morning.  He is not a criminal defense attorney, but he did say that this is a clear cut case of wrongful eviction. I was so upset, it was reassuring to hear someone take my side. He told me that I could press charges, if I wanted to go that way.  He also recommended a good lawyer I could contact to help me deal. I haven't called her yet. And I don't know if I'll press charges, either.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "It's the child-molestation charge, for one. People will automatically say I'm guilty, even though I didn't do anything. God, it makes me so angry! There's nothing I can do, no way I can get back at them. They're probably laughing at me now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What exactly did your landlord accuse you of doing?"}, {"instruction": "She--the landlord's wife--was very vague. She said I had \"sexually molested\" her son. When I asked her what she meant by that, she said that \"I touched him inappropriately.\" She said she had taken him to the doctor, and the doctor confirmed it. I know that has to be a complete fabrication. I never touched him in any sexual sort of way.  The past two weeks, I've been working so much that I hardly saw him at all.", "input": "", "output": "Did they say they would press charges?"}, {"instruction": "No, at least not yet. I was afraid I'd be arrested and held for interrogation. I was afraid to go to the police, I thought they'd assume I was guilty and lock me up forever. God, that sounds so irrational now. But last night, I was so panicked, I was almost hysterical.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell the entire story to the attorney? It sounds as if your landlord might have contrived the whole story just to get you out of your apartment."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I told him as much as I knew.  But I feel like I should have done something differently. Maybe I should have called the police and told them the whole story. I didn't get any witnesses to their threat or any written verification from them. My landlord didn't even give me an eviction notice.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Maybe if I just can get it on paper...I can't let them just walk over me. It makes me so angry. They probably think I'm some wimp--some weak, quiet, feeble person who wouldn't fight back. They get to keep my deposit and last month's rent, and I'm broke. I don't have the money to get another place. Plus, I lost a lot of my stuff.

I better watch what I say.", "input": "", "output": "You may always speak freely here. What I'm hearing is you venting anger...rage, towards people who treated you horribly. Your feelings in this case seem justified. The only time a mental health professional can intervene is if there is a real threat of danger."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm harmless. I'm all talk. I feel so stupid. I wish there was something I could do. I called my sister last night to see if maybe I could stay with her, you know? I knew that was a mistake.

She moved to San Francisco a few months ago. Sometimes, we have lunch or do things together, but it's always a strain for me. She's such a bitch, constantly nagging me.

And I don't need her to tell me that, I already know.", "input": "", "output": "And when you told her about your situation, she responded by blaming you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she said it was my own bad judgment. When I told her they falsely accused me of molesting their son, she said, \"I told you to stay away from those kids.\" It's always, \"I told you so.\" She's always right. I don't know why I even called her. I felt so lost. I just needed someone to talk to.", "input": "", "output": "It might not be a bad idea to keep some distance from your sister, just for the short term. You're going through an enormously difficult time, Sharon. You need people to be supportive of you."}, {"instruction": "I don't have many friends, thanks to my dazzling conversational skills. That's another thing she constantly harps on--my astounding lack of social graces. She just has to rub my face in it every chance she gets: \"You're so shy.

Could you explain what you mean by that?"}, {"instruction": "She's the one my parents like. Linda is going to be a success. I'm always going to be a failure.", "input": "", "output": "That seems a rather extreme view."}, {"instruction": "Linda is one of those people who know how to play the game.  I'm not. I'm so clueless, it's not even funny. But she is a people-person, a charmer, a manipulator, and aggressive about getting what she wants. She's also a cranky bitch and a real pain in the ass.  This must be hard for you to listen to.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you say that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's depressing, isn't it? Don't I seem pathetic and hopeless to you?", "input": "", "output": "Have you been feeling depressed, Sharon? With all of these recent events, feeling stressed or down is really quite a normal response."}, {"instruction": "I don't know if \"depressed\" is the right word. Mostly, I've been really angry. I've been fuming inwardly all yesteray and all last night. I can't stop thinking about it. And what makes it ever worse is there's nothing I can do. I'm completely helpless. I just lay there like a worm, while that scumbag landlord walked all over me. Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse. You know, when I first came to see you, I thought my life was at it's lowest point since I'd been out of the hospital. I didn't think it could possibly get any worse, and it did.", "input": "", "output": "Have you had thoughts about hurting yourself?"}, {"instruction": "If I did, I wouldn't tell you--you'll stick me in a padded cell.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon..."}, {"instruction": "No. No, I haven't felt like doing that. It's mostly about hurting my landlord--revenge fantasies. They're pretty silly, really. I get so worked up, my adrenaline starts going. It's almost a rush.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Listen, can I go now? I'm really tired. I couldn't sleep last night. My head hurts.", "input": "", "output": "If that's what you really want, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Sorry I was late. Isn't that considered bad form to arrive late and leave early?", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "You should be reprimanding me for being so rude. That's what my sister would do. I can almost hear her voice in my head. You know how some women always have that shrill, piercing, nagging tone?", "input": "", "output": "It's all right, Sharon. Look you've got to get in touch with the attorney that the lawyer recommended to you.  You'll probably will get all your stuff and your deposit and last month rent.  But you've got to act right away, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome. Try and get some rest.  And I won't see you next week--it's Thanksgiving weekend.

I'll see you in two weeks."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Sorry I'm late again.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right. How are you?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I didn't really want to come here. It feels like a chore.", "input": "", "output": "You're beginning to dread your therapy sessions?"}, {"instruction": "I just can't stand the thought of facing anyone. I want to hide in my room and sleep all day. I called in sick again today. Hope you don't tell on me.", "input": "", "output": "Are you feeling depressed?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Depressed. Defeated. Drained. And really fat. I ate an entire apple pie yesterday. At first, when I got thrown out of my apartment, I couldn't eat. Now, I can't stop eating.", "input": "", "output": "How is your living situation? You said you found some people you can stay with?"}, {"instruction": "They've been great. Charlotte and Robin--her husband--they really went out of their way to be nice to me. They made dinner on Thanksgiving and took me to the movies. We saw \"L.A. Confidential.\" I slept through the whole thing. I've been feeling really tired lately. It's like sleeping is the only escape I have.", "input": "", "output": "Were you able to talk to an attorney about the charges your landlord made?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I did that on Tuesday. I almost didn't keep the appointment. I didn't want to do anything that would remind me of what happened. I thought maybe if I just side-stepped it all, it would go away. You know, it makes me think of those girls that were in the news--those young girls who denied that they were pregnant and then concealed their pregnancies and killed their babies. I remember the article I read about them, and I identified with them. I understood completely how they could disassociate themselves from reality because they couldn't stand the thought of facing the truth. You can get so caught up in your own denial and pretend it all happened to someone else. Does that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "Yes it does."}, {"instruction": "The lawyer I spoke to said that I should go file a Notice of Wrongful Eviction. He said the child abuse allegations sounded like manipulation. A police report wasn't filed, and they didn't press any charges. I was so afraid I'd be locked up for something I didn't do. But he said that it sounded as if they didn't have enough evidence to press charges and that children that young make unreliable witnesses. This all sounds so terrible. It sounds like I'm guilty.", "input": "", "output": "It's quite an upsetting experience."}, {"instruction": "I was afraid that there might be a trial, and my sexual history would come up. I heard that the courts can subpoena your gynecological records, not to mention my recent incarceration in the nut house.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It's funny that my sexual history would come up again. I thought it was all part of my past. After I got out of the loony bin last year, I had no sex drive at all. At first, I thought it was the medication I was on--for a while I was prescribed lithium. But when I stopped taking it, I still had no libido, which was strange because it had been a major part of my life before that. I used to be almost obsessed with it. Now, I don't even care. I wonder if this is what a neutered cat feels like.", "input": "", "output": "This situation with your landlord--has it brought up memories of your past sexual experiences?"}, {"instruction": "Well, mostly regrets. I don't have a lot of pleasant memories. I went through this period a few years ago--kind of an experimental phase--when I took a lot of drugs and was...ah, promiscuous, you could say. I got involved with some of the alternative lifestyles San Francisco is known for. That's how I met Charlotte.", "input": "", "output": "Were you involved with Charlotte?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no. Nothing like that. This is kind of awkward. I mean, I'm not gay. I'm not a lesbian. I used to think maybe I was. When I went through this experimental phase, I was...uh, exploring that part of myself. But I didn't sleep with Charlotte. I met her through a mutual friend, which is kind of a long story.", "input": "", "output": "Does living with Charlotte again bring back memories of this \"experimental phase\" as you call it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes, but I don't exactly live with her. Charlotte and her husband have been separated for about a year. She said she wanted her freedom--she was exploring her sexuality. Charlotte is also going through menopause. They weren't getting along that well, so Charlotte moved into an apartment. She and Robin still see each other on weekends, and they take vacations together and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I can empathize with what Charlotte's going through. It makes me uncomfortable, though. I'm kind of worried for her, though I know she can take care of herself.", "input": "", "output": "Are you concerned for her safety?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that too. Mostly, I'm worried she'll feel the way I felt when I went through all that. I remember being really depressed and constantly doing meth, or coke, or smoking weed to numb my feelings. I was so...so raw. It was the time in my life when I felt the most vulnerable. And it was my own fault, you know. I didn't know what I was getting into. Charlotte is much more people-savvy; she knows how to protect herself.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It seems like sex is some horrible evil thing--a deep dark secret, you know? In those bad horror movies, like \"The Fly,\" the moral is that there are some things man wasn't meant to know. Maybe that's what sex is to me. I think about that a lot. But I'm not horny anymore, and I have no interest, and no one would want to fuck me anyway. It's like the last five years of my life have been some kind of...I don't know, a morality tale or something. Girl does drugs, has sex, goes crazy, ends up in mental hospital. Am I making any sense? I feel like I'm babbling on and on like an idiot.", "input": "", "output": "You're very lucid, Sharon. Your ambivalence about your sexual needs is something many women feel."}, {"instruction": "Kind of puritanical, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Well, yes, in some ways it is."}, {"instruction": "Are we done yet?", "input": "", "output": "We still have some time left."}, {"instruction": "Because I'm really tired. I need a nap, maybe a snack, too.", "input": "", "output": "Well, you can go if you like. But this is an important issue, and I'd like to discuss it again."}, {"instruction": "Now, I wish I hadn't brought it up.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like you to feel open about discussing uncomfortable subjects here."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. I have something for you. It's...um, it's a poem. It's really bad.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Sharon. I look forward to reading it."}, {"instruction": "You're not going to make nasty little marks with a red pen and then hand it back to me, are you?", "input": "", "output": "No, I try not to grade my patient's work."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Sharon. Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Sharon. How are you feeling?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, kind of tense and anxious.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still dreading your weekly sessions?"}, {"instruction": "Well, actually, I was going to ask you something. It's been bothering me for awhile, but I wasn't sure how to bring it up. I've been thinking about this a lot. Remember last week I told you about how Charlotte and I met?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I believe you said it was through some sort of alternative community in San Francisco."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. That isn't going to go in my file, is it? I don't want anyone to know about this.", "input": "", "output": "As I've said before, everything you say here is confidential."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I feel a little funny talking about this. It's like I unearthed this old relic from my past life. I always think of my life before the hospitalization as \"my past life,\" as opposed to my life right now.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I guess I should get to the point. I really hate the thought of discussing this. I'm afraid you'll think less of me. You'll think I'm immoral or a scum-bag or something. You probably already do.", "input": "", "output": "My purpose here is not to render judgment. I'd like you to be able to express yourself freely here."}, {"instruction": "Okay. About five years ago, I got involved with this San Francisco group called The Society of Janus. Have you heard of it?", "input": "", "output": "They're involved with sadomaschochism, aren't they?"}, {"instruction": "It's an S&M club--kind of a \"how-to\" S&M organization. This guy I was dating was involved in it, and I had always been curious about that sort of thing. So I went to some of their functions and parties, and I met this woman who introduced me to Charlotte.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It seems like such a long time ago. I try to block the memories out.", "input": "", "output": "Are the memories painful?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you could say that. I went in with an open mind, really curious and excited about finding out what it was all about. And at first, it was a lot of fun. It was really exhilarating. I never thought I would do such things, you know, especially not in front of an audience. But I think I got in over my head. And now I'm afraid the same thing will happen to Charlotte.", "input": "", "output": "Are you afraid that Charlotte will have a bad experience?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I felt like it was...kind of like it was damaging for me. I met this whole group of people who had abandoned conventional morality. A lot of them practiced what they called \"polyamory\"--this is a new-age term for non-monogamy. It seemed like this utopian community, where people with unconventional sexual practices could be free and open about their lifestyle. People commonly referred to themselves as \"perverts,\" like it was something to be proud of. At first, I felt like I had found a place where I belonged, you know? Like when Odo the shape-shifter went out into the Gamma Quadrant and found his own people.", "input": "", "output": "Pardon?"}, {"instruction": "Sorry, that was a Star Trek reference. Do you watch \"Deep Space Nine?\"", "input": "", "output": "Occasionally. Did you become disillusioned with this community?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes. It seems like this sort of thing attracts a lot of unconventional types. I heard people say that the S&M community was full of fat losers. Maybe that's not a fair assessment. I met a lot of...I don't know how to say it. I guess they were really obsessive, needy, desperate people. And you know it's funny--people who practice S&M always go on and on about being responsible. They always say that what they do is \"safe, sane, and consensual.\" But what I found through personal experience is that most of them don't practice what they preach and--for all their posturing about being this evolved, enlightened, sexually-liberated group--they really are very intolerant and narrow-minded.", "input": "", "output": "That's an interesting paradox. I've heard similar criticisms about the gay community."}, {"instruction": "Don't get me started! The women in the lesbian S&M community are such total anal-retentive Nazis. They treated me like an outcast. I got all kinds of flak for being too femme. Maybe they would have accepted me if I had a crew cut and a nose ring.", "input": "", "output": "Has Charlotte voiced concerns similar to yours?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she does acknowledge that they can be a bunch of jerks. But she's really caught up in it, just like I was a few years ago. Charlotte finds it glamorous and exciting, and she loves going to parties and all the gossip and cliques. She seems particularly infatuated with people who are celebrities in the community--professional dominants who have a following. I don't think her perception of it is realistic. It looks like she's going to throw away her marriage so she can chase this fantasy. It seems so unfair to Robin.", "input": "", "output": "What is his attitude towards all this?"}, {"instruction": "He's resigned. He doesn't say much. In fact, he's about as quiet and shy as I am. But the few comments he's made and his general demeanor and tone of voice lead me to believe he feels betrayed.", "input": "", "output": "So Robin doesn't share Charlotte's interests?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't think he does. And it's weird, I really identify with Charlotte's infatuation with all this. She's like a kid with a new toy, it's all she ever talks about. She seems proud of it almost, she's constantly name-dropping and talking about these exclusive parties she gets invited to. It's almost like she's in high school. The community is very cliquey, and she really wants to hang out with the \"in-crowd.\" I feel as if I'm watching home movies of myself. It kind of makes me cringe.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Partly, I'm concerned that she's in for a big disappointment. And maybe I'm a little envious that she seems to enjoy it so much, because I always had problems. And I feel for Robin, too. He's getting shafted. He's been made to feel like an outsider, and he hasn't done anything wrong. I've found that when people talk about polyamory...god I hate that word. It's one of those mushy new-age expressions. When people say they want to be polyamorous or non-monogamous, what they really mean is they want someone else to put up with them sleeping around. And that's what Charlotte wants Robin to do. And in a way, I can understand it. What she's doing can be risky. Not just physically, but emotionally. I'm sure she feels a lot safer with someone to come home to. Robin has always been there for her.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I guess I'm a little jealous. I usually don't have anyone--no steady relationship. It seems like I'm always the other woman or the transitional person. I'm good enough to fuck when no one else is available, but no one wants me for the long haul. That's another reason why non-monogamy sucks. Someone is always second best, namely me. But I can understand why, though, as screwed up as I am.", "input": "", "output": "That's a rather harsh assessment of yourself."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's the truth.", "input": "", "output": "Earlier, you mentioned having problems with the people you met in this group. What kind of problems?"}, {"instruction": "It all seems so silly and trivial now. It was mostly gossip. I'm pretty awkward socially, so I was the butt of a lot of people's jokes. I dated some people--both men and women--who were really obsessive and wouldn't leave me alone. I wasn't used to being talked about. It seems in the heterosexual S&M community, there is a big gender imbalance. I'd go to a social event, and there would be all these guys leering at me. And since it's a sexually liberated type of environment, they weren't exactly delicate or tactful about saying what they wanted.", "input": "", "output": "Did you find this demeaning?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah. It seems like if you want to be a sexually liberated woman, you're condemned no matter where you go. People kept saying such nasty things about me--that I was a slut, that I stole boyfriends and husbands. Maybe I did, but they told me they were in open relationships. What was I supposed to do, interrogate everyone they slept with and ask if it was okay?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was like I couldn't do anything right. I don't know why this has come up now. I mean, I don't know why it bothers me so much. I'm sure Charlotte will be just fine. She's older, more mature, and more confident. She'll be able to take care of herself.", "input": "", "output": "What about Robin?"}, {"instruction": "It's hard to tell with him. He's such a cipher. I can sense he's unhappy, and Charlotte complains bitterly about their sex life...or lack thereof. She made a curious comment over the weekend. She said she was glad that I had moved in, because I would \"keep him company\" and she wouldn't have to spend as much time there. I'm not sure what that means.", "input": "", "output": "Does Charlotte consider you as a some sort of replacement for her husband?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe. I don't know. Am I supposed to be a surrogate wife? I hope she doesn't expect me to sleep with him. The idea of having sex with anyone is so repugnant. Ugh!", "input": "", "output": "You say that with great conviction."}, {"instruction": "It really grosses me out. Bodily secretions, and nudity, and being touched...it's all just too disgusting. I sound so puritanical. I used to enjoy sex. Now, just thinking about it makes me want to hurl. I don't even like when people touch me. I'd much rather pet a cat.", "input": "", "output": "Or a ferret. How's Harriet, by the way?"}, {"instruction": "She seems traumatized by the move. Robin has two cats, so Harriet stays in my room. I'm not sure if ferrets are cat-compatible.", "input": "", "output": "I recently acquired a cat myself. A kitten, actually."}, {"instruction": "Really? One of Robin's cats is very young. She acts like a kitten. Kittens are a trip, aren't they? They don't behave anything like grown cats. They're not aloof or dignified at all. They're the silliest, most uninhibited creatures.", "input": "", "output": "They are quite a handful. By the way, have you given any thought to pursuing legal action against your landlord?"}, {"instruction": "A part of me wants to. I'd like to really stick it to him--file a lawsuit and take all his money. Except he doesn't have any. While I lived there, he and his wife fought about money all the time. They were in debt, the place was mortgaged to the hilt. If I sued, there's a good chance I wouldn't get anything, and then I'd be stuck with the legal bills. Besides, their bullshit child-molestation charge would come back to haunt me. If that came up during a trial and my sexual history became an issue...I just couldn't stand it. If they found out what a slut I was and all the things I've done, a judge might think I actually did it. It's all too complicated.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I wonder if Charlotte will have the same regrets someday. While I was experimenting, I never thought about the consequences. I was too caught up in the moment. It's like living in a fantasy world, where you feel like no one can touch you. You get so caught up in the social world and chasing your sexual fantasies, that you lose touch with the real world. Maybe that's not such a bad thing, though. Reality sucks.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds as though you had a number of memorable negative experiences. Did you have any positive experiences?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah. There were a few times when I actually enjoyed what I did and liked who I did it with. But I tend to dwell on the negative.", "input": "", "output": "Would you say your negative experiences outweighed the positive ones?"}, {"instruction": "It seems like every positive experience had a price tag attached. I'd say the emotional cost was too high. I'd play with someone, and they'd act like they owned me and would take for granted that I was there to do anything they wanted. Someone I dated said that being a submissive woman is like carrying a big sign that says \"treat me like shit.\"", "input": "", "output": "Isn't S&M supposed to be consensual? I've often heard that people who engage in that sort of activity discuss everything beforehand and use safe words."}, {"instruction": "Well, people say that, but not everyone means it. Once you're tied up, bound, and gagged, you're at someone else's mercy. And members of the community are very good at parroting the party line--they know all the right things to say. I don't know. It's probably my fault. I didn't communicate enough or work hard enough to protect myself, and now I'm crying \"victim.\" And now, I'm probably projecting all my own fears onto Charlotte.", "input": "", "output": "Don't be so quick to discount your feelings. It sounds as though there is a basis for them."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well...I did hear of other young women in the community who are having the same problems. New members to a group like Janus--especially females--find themselves surrounded by predators. One of the Janus group leaders commented that he would take bets to see how long they'd last.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. You were hesitant about discussing this with me at first. How do you feel now?"}, {"instruction": "All right, I guess. I'm a little relieved. You didn't yell at me or told me what a stupid slut I was.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like you to feel safe about discussing uncomfortable subjects here."}, {"instruction": "I'm just not very open about this sort of thing.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that you're trying, Sharon. And I feel we're making real progress."}, {"instruction": "I feel like I'm being graded--like those scores the judges at the Olympics give. Did I get a perfect ten?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not in the habit of giving numeric scores, but I'd say you're doing well. Same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that'll work. Thanks, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "I am? I've been trying to get here on time; I was late so much before.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I appreciate your efforts. How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "It's been hectic. I've been working a lot of late nights. I don't really mind it though, because I can lose myself in my work. And I've been a real social butterfly this week--I actually left the house twice this week to interact with other people.", "input": "", "output": "Good for you."}, {"instruction": "Not really. I was miserable both times. Last Saturday, Charlotte took me to a benefit for the San Francisco AIDS Emergency Fund. It was held at the Eagle, which is a gay men's leather bar. Some of Charlotte's friends from the S&M community were there.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So was this an S&M event?"}, {"instruction": "Not exactly. The Eagle caters to men who like to dress up in leather. So there were a lot of people dressed in leather or fetish wear, which is usually associated with S&M. But there weren't any public floggings, if that's what you mean.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Charlotte really loves these things. She bought herself a new outfit because she was going to give some sort of speech or presentation or something. I was just going to wear black jeans and a T-shirt. But it was clear that she wanted me to be her date and play the role of the bimbo.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you say that?"}, {"instruction": "She's done this sort of thing before--taking me to a gay event and passing me off as her girlfriend. It always makes me uncomfortable, but I go along with it anyway. This time, she picked out what I was going to wear so I'd look right for the part. I ended up in this tight black dress that I was practically falling out of. I haven't worn it in years. I always feel weird in stuff like that. I don't have the right attitude to pull it off. I just look awkward. It was obvious Charlotte wanted to put me on display.", "input": "", "output": "What happened at the party?"}, {"instruction": "The place was packed. It was hot and dark. And I had to stand the entire time in these foot-crippling high-heeled shoes.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds..."}, {"instruction": "Excruciating. It was. And the worst part of it was that Charlotte kept telling me what an exclusive event it was--I was lucky to be there with her, because this is where all the cool people were. She even said that when other people see me with her, they'd assume that I must be the world's greatest slave--they all knew how selective she is. She told me stand to her left, slightly behind her, like a good submissive. I had to fetch her drinks and make sure no one took her chair.", "input": "", "output": "How did this make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Annoyed. But I gritted my teeth and did it anyway. I felt like I owed her. She's done so much for me--giving me a place to live and all.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "She was really getting on my nerves, though. I was close to snapping at her. The constant name dropping was so pretentious and annoying: \"Do you know her? You don't?\" She knew most of the people there. I saw a few familiar faces, but no one I really knew. I had to stand there in this hot, dark room filled with smoke while she chatted and gossiped. I was so bored and irritated. I couldn't even use the bathroom--the door was chained open to discourage the guys from having sex in there.", "input": "", "output": "Doesn't sound like you enjoyed yourself."}, {"instruction": "I hated it. I resented her for bringing me there and for passing me off like I was her whore. She kept touching me and trying to feed me cake. When she talked to her friends, she talked about me in the third person as though I wasn't there. It was like I was \"the little woman,\" you know? The way men in the 1940's and 1950's thought of their wives.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds demeaning."}, {"instruction": "Yes! I've never been much of a feminist, but this really felt sexist even though it was coming from another woman. And the funny thing is that Charlotte was a really militant feminist in her college days. She called herself a \"gyne-facist.\"", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell her how you felt?"}, {"instruction": "No. I'm a big wimp. I didn't want to disappoint her. I think she was kind of let down, though. When she went on the stage to give her speech, I retreated to the bar so I could sit. I guess she expected me to gaze up at her adoringly, like a good slave should.", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned that Charlotte has done this sort of thing before..."}, {"instruction": "She's quite taken with the women's S&M community. I can understand why she's doing it, why she's playing this game. The women's community isn't very accepting of heterosexuals, or even of bisexuals. Charlotte just wanted to look like she belonged. I felt the same way a few years ago, but I wasn't able to find someone to be my beard.", "input": "", "output": "Beard? You mean a woman who pretends to be the wife or girlfriend of a gay man?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but in this instance, I'm pretending to be the partner of a wanna-be lesbian.", "input": "", "output": "You seem to deeply resent this."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I do. It really pisses me off. But I went along with it.", "input": "", "output": "Because of your sense of obligation to Charlotte?"}, {"instruction": "Because I'm weak and spineless. I do feel like I owe her because she gave me a place to stay, though I suspect she has ulterior motives. That was one of the problems I had in the S&M community--I never felt I could trust anyone. It seemed like everyone was out to get laid. And if they pretended to be nice to you, it was only because they wanted to get in your pants.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Charlotte might be attracted to you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Maybe. I think she's more infatuated with the idea of having a girlfriend. That way, she can brag that she's got a husband and a little slave girl.", "input": "", "output": "Last week, you mentioned that Charlotte doesn't live in the same house with you and Robin."}, {"instruction": "Yes, Charlotte has her own apartment. Sometimes, she visits on the weekends. She and Robin have weekly dates. She doesn't enjoy it at all, though. She gets this resigned, dour look on her face and snaps and snarls at him. Robin is very sweet, almost slavish in his devotion. He does whatever she wants him to do, excluding the whips-and-chains stuff.", "input": "", "output": "And Robin is aware of her other activities?"}, {"instruction": "He said he doesn't want to know. I'm sure he suspects the worst. When we got home that night, he was hiding in his study. He doesn't want to deal with it. I have a feeling it really bothers him. It must be emasculating for him. Men always get so defensive if their sexual prowess is ever called into question. I saw him the next morning, and he was kind of cautious, you know? He asked me if I had a good time, but didn't ask for details. He seemed amused when I told him I was really glad when it was over.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I saw my sister on Sunday. That was another excruciating experience. I really am a masochist.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you say that?"}, {"instruction": "My sister is a bitch. Unlike me, she has no trouble saying what she wants and making demands of others. She wanted me to take her shopping, ordered me around, and told me where to go. Linda doesn't even try to be tactful.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "During lunch, she said that the eldest child is supposed to care for the parents, according to Japanese tradition. Then she said that, of course, she would have to take on that responsibility, because I didn't make enough money. She always has to tell me what a failure I am. She's hypercritical. I was goofing around in the mall, looking at wind-up toys in the children's toy store. Linda, who has no patience, said she didn't have all day to wait for me and that I looked like a fucking retard playing with children's toys. And, of course, she had to throw in that I needed to go back on Lithium and see a shrink. When she goes on one of her rants, she sounds just like my father.", "input": "", "output": "Was your father excessively critical of you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I really don't like to talk about him. Linda says he has mellowed a lot in his old age, that he is not as angry as he used to be. She also says I owe him some loyalty because he's sent me money. But that doesn't make up for all that he did. I still have nightmares about him. I guess I will always have a lot of anger towards him. People used to tell me that I looked like him. I hated that. My mother and sister used to always say: \"You're just like your father.\"", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned earlier that your father was abusive."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. A real Irishman: a wife-beater and a drunk. He was always angry about something, at least he was with me. He didn't do that to Linda. But it seemed no matter what I did, it was never good enough. I remember he used to keep me up all night, having these drunken tirades, telling me how worthless I was. He used to say I was ugly and stupid, and that I was a mistake, and if he hadn't gotten my mother pregnant, he wouldn't be stuck with me. I don't know why that bothers me so much now. It was years ago, I should get over it.", "input": "", "output": "Those are very hurtful things for a parent to say."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, I have these fantasies about getting back at him. I think of visiting him in the hospital when he's seriously ill and has all these tubes coming out of him. I'd like to scream insults at him and throw things at him when he's helpless and weak and can't defend himself. I'd like to tell him what a fucking loser I think he is.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever talked to your father about your feelings for him?"}, {"instruction": "No, I haven't spoken to him in years. Sometimes, I send him a card at Christmas. My mother told me that he was contrite, that he's stopped drinking and changed. Actually, I did confront him once when I was in high school, while I still lived at home. He laughed at me and said I was making it all up. He didn't remember specific incidents that I recalled. But I know it isn't fantasy. I'm not delusional.", "input": "", "output": "Many alcoholics use denial as a way of avoiding their problems."}, {"instruction": "I wish I hadn't said anything now. I'm really pissed off.", "input": "", "output": "It's natural that you'd feel angry..."}, {"instruction": "I don't think I'll ever get over it. I really don't want to see my sister again. She brings back a lot of bad feelings and memories. I'd like to have nothing to do with my family ever again.", "input": "", "output": "It is possible to come to terms with your anger and resentment towards your family through therapy. But it takes a lot of work, it requires a real commitment to getting better."}, {"instruction": "That's how you guys make so much money. What a racket. It's a conspiracy. I bet you're in cahoots with my father.", "input": "", "output": "We all are, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Ha! I knew it.", "input": "", "output": "All kidding aside, I realize that your coming here reflects a desire to get better, to come to terms with your past. I'm glad that you feel safe enough now to open up during our sessions."}, {"instruction": "Now I really wish I hadn't said anything.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't like being that vulnerable, I guess. I feel like you know too much now and will use that information to make fun of me, like that last dickhead therapist that I had.", "input": "", "output": "Don't malign all therapists because of one bad experience. I hope that you'll develop enough trust in me to feel comfortable being vulnerable here."}, {"instruction": "Can't you just pump me full of drugs so I don't care anymore?", "input": "", "output": "That's hardly a constructive approach, especially with your medical history."}, {"instruction": "Damn. That means I won't get Xanax any more.", "input": "", "output": "I might consider prescribing a non-addictive anti-depressant at a very low dosage if it was necessary. But you seem to be making progress without any medication."}, {"instruction": "I'm going to make a note to myself to act more crazy when I come here.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to see you still have a sense of humor."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm a real card. Sometimes, I think my sister and father were right--I am a total idiot and a loser, and my life is hopeless. I don't know. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I'm just babbling on and on.", "input": "", "output": "You might feel overwhelmed right now. That's understandable. You've been through a lot in the past few weeks. I feel gratified that you've continued your therapy this far, which means you must have some interest in getting better."}, {"instruction": "I want to get better. I want to be a normal person, instead of the screwed up neurotic that I am. I just don't want to work at it. Too bad there's no \"normal pill\" you can take to make you a happy, well-adjusted person.", "input": "", "output": "You've revealed quite a bit in this session. How do you feel now?"}, {"instruction": "Like I should have kept my mouth shut. But at least now you know. I don't have to tiptoe around the past like I used to. I don't have to be so cautious about what I say. That's good, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it is. Next week I won't be having regular sessions--it's Christmas and New Year. So I'll see you on January 9th at this same time.  All right?"}, {"instruction": "All right. Thanks, Doctor Balis. Merry Christmas.", "input": "", "output": "Bye, Sharon. Merry Christmas."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor Balis. It's really coming down out there--this rain is just relentless. I feel like I'm in Seattle.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah.  It's pretty bad. I'll be on vacation the next two weeks.  Hopefully, it's better there than here."}, {"instruction": "Lucky you. Didn't you just have two weeks off?", "input": "", "output": "I haven't been seeing a lot of patients over the holidays, but I still had a lot of work to do--dealing with HMO's is never easy.  I'm really looking forward to actually getting away--trust me, this vacation is badly needed. So our next session will be Thursday, January 29th at 10 am. Is that all right?"}, {"instruction": "Jeez, you shrinks have it made. Although it must be hard work having to listen to so many whining neurotics. Yeah, it's okay.", "input": "", "output": "Good. How were the holidays?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess. The only thing I like about them is that I don't have to work. It wasn't so bad this year.", "input": "", "output": "The holidays trigger depression for many people."}, {"instruction": "I'm depressed year-round.  Here, you asked me to bring you some doodles.  Here they are.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Thanks."}, {"instruction": "I spent Christmas watching the Sister Wendy Marathon on Public Television with Robin, Charlotte's husband. We spent New Year's Day watching the South Park marathon. It was a real bonding experience. We worked on bad impressions of Sister Wendy and Cartman--the fat kid on South Park. Rob has a great sense of humor.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you've been spending more time together."}, {"instruction": "Well, Charlotte is caught up in her social whirl. She's almost frenetic in her constant activity. It's like she can't stand to have a blank space in her calendar. She has so many exclusive parties and \"oh-so-cool\" people to hang out with, she just doesn't have time for the likes of the \"vanilla\" world. Rob and I are left at home to rot our brains with bad television and eat cheesy poofs.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Vanilla means non-S&M--normal people who have sex in the missionary position the way God intended, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I see. You seem to have a profound distaste for the S&M community."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Don't get me wrong--I'm all for civil rights and everything. They can beat, electrocute, pierce, and smear fecal matter on each other all they want, but I'd like to be spared the lurid details. Charlotte's very in-your face about her sexuality. I get sick of listening to her go on and on about what she did to whom.", "input": "", "output": "Do you find it distasteful or merely annoying?"}, {"instruction": "I'd have to say annoying. It's almost adolescent in a way. Menopause is a sort of mid-life adolescence, accompanied with all the hormonal fluctuations, mood swings, attitude, and irritating behavior.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Charlotte seems to get much of her identity from the S&M community."}, {"instruction": "It's the focus of her life. It's all she talks about. Charlotte's very eager to proclaim S&M as her sexual identity. And she's changed a lot. Rob and I have been talking about that, and he's rather dismayed, not just by her activities but her demeanor, her personality. He compares her to a new sorority girl, with all the name dropping, party-going, and that \"cooler-than-thou\" attitude. She's changed her appearance, too. She now has this bright carroty-orange colored hair and dresses more provocatively than she ever did before.", "input": "", "output": "Does her overt sexuality make you uncomfortable?"}, {"instruction": "It just really grosses me out. It's repelling. But maybe I wouldn't feel that way if it weren't for my own sexual hangups. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, sexuality is supposed to be healthy, right? And I've been pretty asexual since that incident...you know? The one the year before?", "input": "", "output": "Are you referring to your suicide attempt?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. What I mean is that sexual desire is supposed to be normal. Everyone is entitled to their sexuality, and it should be a positive thing regardless of age. But it seems that any representation of human sexuality puts me off.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. When you see a suggestive advertisement in the newspaper--like some of the Calvin Klein ads, for example--do these images disgust you?"}, {"instruction": "No. Those images are distant and...I don't know, antiseptic somehow. Sexual images in the media don't really bother me, except to make me self-conscious about my weight.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you have a weight problem?"}, {"instruction": "I've gained a few pounds. It's so embarrassing. Rob really likes to cook.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So sexually suggestive themes in the media don't repel you, but Charlotte's overt sexuality does. Why is that, you think?"}, {"instruction": "Because it's real. It's immediate. It's right in front of me, and it's disgusting. And Charlotte's not exactly a super model. I know it's not politically correct, but she wears some revealing outfits and they aren't...uh, exactly becoming on her. The sight of her sagging breasts falling out of her blouse is enough to make me gag. People stare at her, and it's not a flattering kind of attention. Sometimes, I think she looks grotesque--she's this heavy-set middle-aged woman in clothes which are much too tight, acting like a vamp. It makes me sick.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I already told you, because sex grosses me out. Don't they teach you to listen in shrink school? Maybe you should take notes or something.", "input": "", "output": "Don't be defensive. I am listening, Sharon. What I'm trying to get at is why sex disgusts you so much."}, {"instruction": "This discussion is starting to disgust me.", "input": "", "output": "We don't have to continue this right now, if you'd rather not."}, {"instruction": "How about those Niners?", "input": "", "output": "This is a serious issue, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "I'm glad that sexuality isn't an important part of my life anymore. My amateur armchair psychologist spin on it is that my sex drive led to my downfall. For me, sex always led to drugs, alcohol, and other compulsive behavior.", "input": "", "output": "Other compulsive behavior? Such as?"}, {"instruction": "I used to be bulimic. I don't want to get into that now. I stopped doing that because some of my back teeth fell out. Anyway, sex is this powerful, destructive monster--like the things that came out of Pandora's Box. I let out a little sexual desire, and then all the other bad things come out--all the addictions and compulsions--and get out of control. I've tried celibacy once before, for two years, and it was an enormous effort. It was like this monster inside me had to come out. And now that I'm a burned-out druggie slut, the beast is gone, and I'm better for it.", "input": "", "output": "That's an interesting analogy."}, {"instruction": "Not terribly original. It's kind of tired and trite.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's better to live a sexless existence, like a neutered cat. That's what Rob and I are--two neutered cats. We get sensual pleasure out of eating and watching TV. We're simple, happy creatures.", "input": "", "output": "Are you happy?"}, {"instruction": "No, but sometimes I like to pretend I am.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by that?"}, {"instruction": "When I can stop obsessing about all my troubles, I'm kind of happy. I'm content. I think the secret to happiness is self-delusion--divorcing one's self from reality as much as possible.", "input": "", "output": "Quite philosophical."}, {"instruction": "I think it's from spending so much time with Rob. We hardly saw Charlotte over the past few weeks. She just popped in and out when she felt like it. It was weird, you know? She came and went as she pleased and acted like we were guests in her house. It's unfair to Rob--that she can have her cake and eat it, too.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And how does that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I identify with Charlotte's frantic search for this sexual something to fill a void. But I also empathize with Rob, because he is clearly Charlotte's second choice now. She only sees him when she doesn't have a more pressing engagement with her leather-and-rubber clad friends. She's like a man who's left his aging wife for a younger, more attractive woman.", "input": "", "output": "Another interesting analogy."}, {"instruction": "Don't belittle me, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Please don't get defensive, Sharon. I wasn't belittling you."}, {"instruction": "Sounds like you're making fun of me.", "input": "", "output": "It was just a comment. It wasn't intended as an insult."}, {"instruction": "I suppose I'm too sensitive.", "input": "", "output": "Is something else bothering you?"}, {"instruction": "You're staring to remind me of that fag shrink I went to see in Pacific Heights. He was a really smug little prick. And I was so desperate for someone to talk to. I told him...I told him more than I should have. I told him what my father did to me. And he obviously thought of me as nothing more than a bad joke.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry you had such a bad experience with your previous therapist, Sharon. But I'd hoped that you could separate him from me.  Not all therapists are alike."}, {"instruction": "Now you're patronizing me.", "input": "", "output": "That's not fair, Sharon.  And it's not true."}, {"instruction": "This is a mistake. I don't know what the hell I was thinking. I'm leaving.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, please don't...Sharon? Sharon?"}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor Balis. I'm really sorry about our last session. I don't know what got into me.", "input": "", "output": "I have to say that I was concerned and a bit puzzled. I wasn't sure why you were so upset."}, {"instruction": "I don't know either. I've been in a weird mood lately. I've been cranky and irritable. How was your vacation?", "input": "", "output": "Very relaxing. So nothing in particular triggered your mood?"}, {"instruction": "I'm just a cranky bitch.", "input": "", "output": "That seems a bit of an oversimplification."}, {"instruction": "Well, I am. I really am a miserable person, Doctor Balis, just like Ebeneezer Scrooge or the Jack Nicholson character in \"As Good As It Gets.\"", "input": "", "output": "Both those characters achieved redemption."}, {"instruction": "My father is a miserable person, too. He's in the hospital now. I got a phone call from my sister. She told me he was rushed to the emergency room with chest pains.", "input": "", "output": "When did this happen?"}, {"instruction": "Last week Tuesday. At first, it looked like a heart attack, but it turned out to be only an anxiety attack coupled with some serious indigestion. But my family is pissed at me now because I didn't rush out to his bedside like my sister did. She's only sucking up to him because she wants him to die so she can get the money.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Why didn't you go to visit your father?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't that big a deal; it wasn't like he was on his deathbed. And even if he was, I wouldn't have wanted to see him anyway. I really, really hate him. I wish he was dead.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Are your mother and sister aware of your feelings towards him?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I told him what I thought of him when I moved out. My sister, of course, took that opportunity to tell me once again what a loser I was, how I had no sense of filial responsibility, and how I was just a leech sucking the family dry.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like your sister was angry."}, {"instruction": "And I said, \"Fuck you, fat ass!\" and hung up the phone. My diplomatic skills have never been finer.", "input": "", "output": "You obviously have a great deal of negative emotion towards both your father and your sister."}, {"instruction": "They're carbon copies of each other. My mother and Linda used to tell me, \"You're just like your father.\" But it's Linda who resembles him the most. I'm much more quiet and passive, like my mother, except when I'm screaming obscenities into the telephone. My sister is loud and abrasive and critical, like my father. She drinks, too.", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned previously that your father was abusive and an alcoholic."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. He doesn't deserve to live. He's just a waste of space sucking up resources.", "input": "", "output": "Was your father abusive towards your sister and mother as well?"}, {"instruction": "He used to hit my mother and me but not Linda. Linda was a frail and sickly child. She was really small for her age. My parents always gave her preferential treatment; she never had to do chores, or get good grades, or do any of those things. I don't think they ever hit her. They used to hit me when she had done something wrong, because it was my responsibility to look after her.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I remember in previous sessions it made you very uncomfortable to talk about your father. How do you feel discussing him now?"}, {"instruction": "Angry. I get so angry I can't stand it. I'm glad I don't own a gun, or I'd put a bullet through his head. That must sound pretty sick.", "input": "", "output": "It's quite normal for victims of abuse to experience feelings of rage towards their abusors."}, {"instruction": "I wish I could forget what he did to me. I still have nightmares about it. Sometimes, the memories come back, and they're so intense. And I'm full of anger and hate, and there's nothing I can do about it. I get these flashbacks out of the blue, out of nowhere--like when I'm formatting a spreadsheet at work--everything will be just fine, and then bam! Nothing in particular seems to trigger them.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Maybe if he died, they would go away.", "input": "", "output": "Could you describe the flashbacks?"}, {"instruction": "No. I already told you I don't like to talk about it.", "input": "", "output": "Is it very upsetting for you to discuss it?"}, {"instruction": "I don't see the point. You're acting like you don't believe me, like I'm just crying victim to get attention like the guests on the Jerry Springer Show.", "input": "", "output": "I believe you, Sharon. And I want to help you with this. I know the memories of your father's abuse are a painful issue for you, but I think it would be worthwhile to explore this area. I realize you've had some bad experiences in the past with other therapists, but I hope that you've grown to trust me enough..."}, {"instruction": "My father hit me, you know. He spanked and whipped me when I was bad or, sometimes, for no reason at all. I guess that's not so unconventional. But it wasn't enough for him to beat me physically. He made me do things that were really humiliating. And he loved to tell me over and over again that he was ashamed to have me for a daughter, that I was a mistake and was never meant to be born, that he wished he'd never had me, that I was worthless, and that I'd ruined his life because he had to get married because of me.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Is that enough? Do you need to know all the gory details?", "input": "", "output": "You only need to tell me what you feel comfortable with."}, {"instruction": "I reached puberty early, and he gave me a really bad time.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want to say it. You know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "Did your father abuse you sexually?"}, {"instruction": "No! Of course not! That's disgusting! I can't believe you said that.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Sharon. Calm down."}, {"instruction": "The funny thing is that I'm sure this is the reason why I got interested in S&M.", "input": "", "output": "That's quite common as well. Adults who were abused as children frequently reenact the abuse either as victims or as perpetrators."}, {"instruction": "But that doesn't make any sense. Why would I return to something that was so horrible, something I wanted so much to forget?", "input": "", "output": "Survivors of childhood abuse learn to substitute pain, rejection, and insecurity for love and affection. They've been conditioned to do so by their perpetrators, especially if those perpetrators are their parents. People return to what is familiar. And if a person has  a history of abuse, physical and emotional pain would seem normal to that person. Have you had relationships with abusive men?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I'm an asshole-magnet--meaning I attract men who are jerks. I don't know why...no, I take that back. I do know why. But I'm powerless to change it.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you say that?"}, {"instruction": "It's written in the stars, you know? It's part of my genetic code. Some people are destined to be losers and victims.", "input": "", "output": "I think by coming here, you show that you're willing to overcome what you perceive as your destiny. You want to stop being a victim, you want to put a stop to your self-destructive behaviors."}, {"instruction": "I think it's hopeless. I'm thirty now. I'm all washed up.", "input": "", "output": "Happy birthday. I hardly think your life is over at 30."}, {"instruction": "I'm a fossil. I'm old and decrepit. An old geezer. I hate being old. Let's talk about something else.", "input": "", "output": "How are things at home?"}, {"instruction": "Charlotte and Rob are not on good terms. They took me out for my birthday, and it went badly. They haven't talked much to each other since.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Charlotte wanted to try this new Japanese restaurant. She read about it in the pink section of the Chronicle and heard it was a trendy new eatery. Of course, there was a long line; we waited nearly an hour before we got a table. When we finally sat down, we were crammed in a tiny space. And Charlotte's not exactly petite. Then Rob knocked over his cup of tea, and Charlotte started snapping at him. She was in a really foul mood and was argumentative and irritable.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And since I'm a half-Jap, she wanted me to impress the waitress by ordering in Japanese. The waitress looked Americanized enough to me. I told Charlotte I was a little rusty, and she launched into a tirade--how valuable knowing a foreign language could be, how I could broaden my career opportunities and even work overseas, and blah blah blah. I was relieved when the food came, so Charlotte could stuff her face and leave me alone. You know how to eat sushi, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "I've never seen San Franciscans so clumsy with Japanese food. Charlotte picked up pieces of futomaki with her fingers, for Christ sake! And she took pickled ginger and placed it on top of the futomaki--like she was putting cheese on a cracker--and then slopped soy sauce all over it and ate it that way! She couldn't stuff that whole mess into her gaping maw, so she tried to eat it in bites and got rice all over the table. It was disgusting.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I think you might be over reacting a bit to her..."}, {"instruction": "When the miso soup came, Charlotte asked for a spoon. A spoon! She pantomimed spooning soup in to her mouth for the waitress, while saying loudly, \"You know, spoon!\" That was pretty condescending; the waitress' English was just fine. Charlotte must subscribe to the belief that Asians can understand English only if it is spoken loudly and slowly and with appropriate hand gestures. I don't know why it bothered me so much. I was embarrassed, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, Charlotte nagged and complained throughout dinner. She sent back her food twice--she's a picky eater. And she complained all the way home. When we got home, I went to my room, while she started on Rob. He's usually pretty quiet, but after a while, he started yelling back. I couldn't hear much, but I heard my name come up a few times. I heard a door slam when Charlotte left.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Rob didn't mention it the next day. He gave me a new coat, though. He said it was from him and Charlotte for my birthday. It was really nice--a London Fog. I haven't had a new coat in years.", "input": "", "output": "How are you and Rob getting along?"}, {"instruction": "We're both painfully shy, antisocial, and neurotic--we get along fine.", "input": "", "output": "I see. You've talked about some difficult subjects today. How do you feel now?"}, {"instruction": "I'm all right. I feel a little weird about it. It still bothers me, kind of...", "input": "", "output": "What bothers you?"}, {"instruction": "That you know so much. That you might tell the people that I work with about my sordid past.", "input": "", "output": "You know that won't happen"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well...I'm a little paranoid.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that you were willing to take this step, Sharon. It shows that you're making progress."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I'm still a loser--a thirty-year-old loser.", "input": "", "output": "I don't agree with your self-assessment. In my professional opinion, it's a little too soon to diagnose yourself as a \"loser,\" even if you've reached the ripe old age of thirty. However, I understand that there are issues you want to work on--that's what brought you to therapy. Change doesn't take place immediately. Growth is a gradual process."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doctor. See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Not so good. My ferret died.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I'm very sorry. How did it happen?"}, {"instruction": "I used to let Harriet run around in the garage while I did laundry. Charlotte came by unexpectedly. She and Rob had a fight last week, so they haven't been speaking. She used her garage-door opener to get into the house and left the door open. I guess Harriet must have gotten out or maybe the dog came in. I was in the house when it happened. The neighbor's dog got hold of Harriet somehow. When I talked to them later, they said they found the remains of some small animal in their yard. I was too upset to look. I guess its my fault really, though I was pretty upset with Charlotte.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like an accident. Why do you blame yourself?"}, {"instruction": "If I'd been out there, this wouldn't have happened. A part of me resents Charlotte for coming and going as she pleases. But that doesn't make sense--it's her house. She didn't even seem to care when I told her what happened. Charlotte only came by to borrow the bread-maker.

The recipes weren't as good. And he didn't look good, you know? It was like his soul had been taken away, like all the life had been drained from him. Here was someone who clearly loved food. You could argue he loved food to a point where it was unhealthy. But convert him to a low-fat diet, and you take an essential part of him away.

But by making modifications to his diet and lifestyle, he could avoid a host of physical problems, such as heart disease and high blood pressure. Being physically healthy can contribute to your overall sense of well being. The other problem with drug use is that they affect the dopamine levels in your brain. That is the chemical that is responsible for pleasure..."}, {"instruction": "Hey, hey, hey--I like being stoned.", "input": "", "output": "Please be serious, Sharon.

That it's part of your financial obligation to him?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I don't have to, but it seems appropriate. It did make him feel better. He seemed in better spirits the next day. It seems to be more important for men to get laid than for women, even for men who aren't very sexual.", "input": "", "output": "Like Rob?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.

Some people can make good marijuana brownies, but not me. Mine always end up looking like chunks of horse shit with bits of green plant matter in them. And they don't taste so hot either.

This would be a chance to give yourself a rest, Sharon, and to deal with the issues that led you to drug use."}, {"instruction": "A nice prison--a touchy-feely, soft and mushy, new age-type institution, where the cells are padded with organic cotton and the inmates weave their own restraints in arts-and-crafts class.", "input": "", "output": "Give it a try, Sharon. Try it for a week."}, {"instruction": "Will they make me take mud baths and sit in smelly sawdust?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure what you're referring to exactly, but no."}, {"instruction": "Do I have to hug the other inmates?", "input": "", "output": "Not if you don't want to."}, {"instruction": "Sounds like a real picnic. Is there cable?", "input": "", "output": "I could give them a call and check."}, {"instruction": "Why can't I just continue seeing you? You're so dedicated, and you don't care at all about money--a doctor completely devoted to the well-being of his patients.", "input": "", "output": "Frankly, I don't think you're making any progress.

I can't believe it. That's the ultimate rejection--my shrink dumped me. It's not like I've been unfaithful. I haven't seen any other shrinks. Sometimes, I listen to Doctor Laura Schlesinger on the radio. But she's not really a shrink, so that doesn't count, does it?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not dumping you. I'm just letting you know that there are limits. In my role as a therapist, I have the right to make certain demands on my patients. I've asked you to refrain from drug use before your sessions.

But unless you're willing to undergo treatment for your addiction, I..."}, {"instruction": "So you're going to have me committed. This is the one thing I was afraid of, you know? This is one of the reasons why I didn't want to see a shrink again.", "input": "", "output": "I don't want to commit you, Sharon. I'd like you to check in to a substance abuse treatment center voluntarily. And that's quite different from being sent to a mental hospital involuntarily."}, {"instruction": "Well, even if I did agree to do it, it won't do any good. When I was in the psycho ward, after I got over the initial shock of being imprisoned, I only went along with what those fucking shrinks and doctors wanted me to do so I could get out. I parroted all the right platitudes, made those stupid fucking arts and crafts projects, and participated in insipid discussions with drooling spastics on the importance of keeping the communal area cleaned. It was all an act, I didn't mean any of it. If I go to this place, this druggie ward, it will be the same thing.  You'll see.", "input": "", "output": "I'd still like you to give it a try.

I just don't know.", "input": "", "output": "If you choose to pursue the treatment, I can have you admitted right away."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  I'll do it.", "input": "", "output": "That's great.  I'll arrange it right now and we can go together.  Let me just make a few calls.  And, Sharon, I think you might give Rob a call. He must be quite concerned about you."}, {"instruction": "Rob? Oh. So that's how you knew. What did he tell you?", "input": "", "output": "I think you should call him and let him know you're all right."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Sharon. Let me just arrange this now."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doctor.  But I don't have any of my stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Don't worry about that; they provide what you need.  I think it's important that you get started right away."}, {"instruction": "All right, I guess. Here, I made you a potholder in my arts and crafts class.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you."}, {"instruction": "It doubles as a coaster.

When am I getting out?", "input": "", "output": "I don't have a definite date yet, but it should be soon."}, {"instruction": "What do you mean, soon?", "input": "", "output": "I've reviewed your progress with the staff, and I think it would be a good idea for you to stay another week."}, {"instruction": "So I'm not getting out anytime soon. The last time I was locked up, shrinks played the same game. They'd say I'd be getting out one day, and when that day would come, they'd say I wouldn't be getting out for another few days. It's a shitty thing to do.", "input": "", "output": "I agree.  But I'm always honest with you, Sharon. Now, how do you like the facility?"}, {"instruction": "I don't. It really sucks here. When am I getting out?", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel you've been able to work on the issues that led to your drug use?"}, {"instruction": "You just want me to mouth empty platitudes: how I've gotten in touch with my inner child, and faced my demons, and purged my soul, and all that other psycho babble bullshit you shrinks love so much. Well, I haven't used in a week.", "input": "", "output": "Good..."}, {"instruction": "You said I would be here for only a week--you're the one that's being dishonest and unethical.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, I'd like you to stay here until you feel you're on the road to overcoming your addiction. You haven't used any drugs for a week, and that's very good. But you're not completely recovered yet."}, {"instruction": "I'm never going to be completely recovered. Isn't that what they teach you in those insipid twelve step programs? Addicts are addicts for life. I'm always going to have the same addictive personality. Are you planning on keeping me locked up for life?", "input": "", "output": "You have a very serious and long-term history of drug use.You've been abusing some very addictive substances. I'm glad you are willing to give this a try. But it's not time to stop yet. You'll benefit from this program the most by remaining here for a while."}, {"instruction": "Shit.", "input": "", "output": "Have you had any visitors?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I called Rob and he came to see me. He bought me some warm clothes. Why is it so fucking cold in here?", "input": "", "output": "Your body's vulnerable. You might be particularly sensitive to cold right now."}, {"instruction": "This is like some new-age dungeon. I hate being confined. I hate being locked up like this. Just look at the people here. Have you ever seen so many miserable people in one place in your life? I can't even get a decent cup of coffee.", "input": "", "output": "I'm surprised.  I thought coffee was the one drug they pushed here."}, {"instruction": "No, they save the coffee for the alcoholics. All we get is herbal tea that tastes like horse piss. Not even a diet Pepsi--it's endless apple juice.", "input": "", "output": "Have you participated in any of the group sessions? You'll make greater progress if you take an active role in your recovery."}, {"instruction": "Look, Doctor, I don't want to sit with a group of whiners and spill my heart out about my unhappy childhood and all that other crap. And I would have to hug some blubbering idiot. I hate hugging people. It's a plague. It's the scourge of the late 20th century.  Do you know Leo Buscaglia?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Look, I knitted a fucking potholder. That's something, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "It's a good idea to keep your hands busy."}, {"instruction": "So I won't claw my eyes out, or attack the other inmates, or try to find a means of escape?", "input": "", "output": "You're quite angry."}, {"instruction": "You said I'd only be here a week.

What the fuck is wrong with my demeanor?", "input": "", "output": "You're still in drug withdrawal. I talked to the staff here, and we all think it would be best for you to stay a bit longer."}, {"instruction": "\"A bit longer?\" You're being deliberately vague. I don't like the idea that you were all talking about me behind my back, plotting against me. You're planning to keep me here forever, aren't you?", "input": "", "output": "No, Sharon. No one is trying to keep you here indefinitely. I talked to the other staff members to evaluate your progress. It's fairly routine."}, {"instruction": "Why didn't you just ask me? I would have told you I was doing fine.", "input": "", "output": "You're not in a postion to be able to make objective judgements."}, {"instruction": "So now you're accusing me of lying.", "input": "", "output": "Addicts are very poor judges of their abilities to control their addiction. I need objective data. You were able to stay off drugs for a week, and considering the extent of your substance abuse, that's quite remarkable. But if I approve your release now, there's a good chance that you'll go back to using drugs again. I want you to be committed to staying off drugs."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'm committed.", "input": "", "output": "Then stay here for another week."}, {"instruction": "Fuck, no!", "input": "", "output": "Just stay this weekend then.

I should never have agreed to come here.", "input": "", "output": "Addiction and other self-destructive behaviors have serious long-term consequences. It's unrealistic for you to expect that you can stop abusing substances like heroin and methamphetamine overnight. Drug use took a toll on you physically and psychologically. You need to give yourself more time."}, {"instruction": "I just don't think it's necessary to have me incarcerated.", "input": "", "output": "Stay here for the weekend, Sharon. I'll talk to the staff psychiatrist on Monday and see about your release."}, {"instruction": "The head shrink here is a total bonehead, you know.

And what's worse is that I'm addicted to it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's interesting to watch bad television with deeply disturbed people--I just watch their reactions.

I was listening to the NPR radio show, \"Fresh Air,\" KQED-FM. Peter Coyote was being interviewed, and he discussed his drug use, which included heroin. He said that it was the ritual he enjoyed most: scoring drugs, cooking them, loading up the syringe, tying up his arm to get the vein bulging, putting the needle in. It made me think of how many times I had done that, usually on the floor of a dirty bathroom. It was like I could steal away from the rest of the world into my own.", "input": "", "output": "You actually enjoyed the act of injecting yourself with drugs?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I did.", "input": "", "output": "That seems to be the unpleasant part of drug use."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess to a non-user it would seem that way.", "input": "", "output": "And you drove while under the influence? Frequently?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I really liked driving when I was high. I got lost a lot, though.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did you feel a craving for drugs after you heard that interview?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, the clonidine seems to help, but I still miss them. I wish I hadn't heard the interview. That was the problem with twelve-step programs for me. In those meetings, you have to listen to people tell \"glory day\" stories of their drug use. There's this atmosphere of one-upmanship going on--each person tries to tell a more fantastic story, a more extreme tale of self-destruction. And rather than giving me an aversion to drug use, these meetings made me want to go out and get high again.", "input": "", "output": "I see.

Do you consider yourself an atheist or agnostic?"}, {"instruction": "I consider myself extremely intolerant of people who follow pop-psychology and that mushy-headed new-age jargon they all speak. I have to admit that I like Rational Recovery's straightforward, no-nonsense approach. The people there seemed real, not like the insufferably sanctimonious brainwashed zombies you see at AA meetings, who speak almost entirely in twelve-step clich\u00e9s like that Stuart Smalley character from Saturday Night Live.", "input": "", "output": "Good.

We were walking into the building at the same time, and he asked me where the meeting was being held. It made me very uncomfortable. I stammered and felt my face get hot. I rode with him in the elevator--I couldn't think of an excuse to get away. He made small talk, and I felt so awkward. If I was more self confident, maybe I would have flirted or at least been more forthcoming. But all I could do was give monosyllabic answers like a brain-damaged teenager.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Pretty silly, isn't it?

The feelings of nervousness or uneasiness you described are completely normal. It's also normal for people to be somewhat \"lookist\" if you will. Few people can avoid being swayed by appearances. Have you given any thought to dating?"}, {"instruction": "Well, no. Maybe in theory, but not in practice. The thought of social interaction of any kind is almost enough to make me break out in hives. It's all too intimidating. And I don't think Rob would like it.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I feel that I owe Rob a lot for taking me in. But at the same time, I resent him because there's so much about our relationship--or whatever you want to call it--that isn't very satisfying.

No, I haven't seen it yet."}, {"instruction": "There's a scene where Woody Allen refers to Soon-Yi as a \"kid who ate out of garbage cans.\" I found that remark disturbing, especially since he said it in an offhanded way. It seems to me that he'll always see her as a street urchin, a charity case, no matter how old she is or what she accomplishes. He seems to be implying that she is somehow beneath him, a substandard woman or something. He isn't capable of seeing her as an equal or a partner. And I think Rob sees me the same way.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Because of the circumstances that brought us together. If it weren't for his good graces, I'd probably be living in my car or in some squalid residential hotel in the Tenderloin. I'm indebted to Rob, and I can't see anyone else, not that I would want to or could. I'm sure the incredibly good-looking guy I met at the group would never be interested in someone like me.

Rob said that if I waited a few minutes for him to take care of Charlotte, he'd drive me to the hospital. I was so pissed off that he wanted me to wait when I was in so much pain, that I hobbled to my car and drove myself.", "input": "", "output": "You drove yourself to the hospital with a crushed foot?"}, {"instruction": "I had a hard time driving, and it was really hard hopping from the parking lot to the emergency room entrance.

The people at work are going out of their way to be nice to me, offering to get me lunch and carry my things. And I've always thought they didn't like me.

Well, either that, or she bought a large quantity of See's 1-pound Nuts-and-Chews boxes at a discount. Rob, on the other hand, has been a real...well, he's not bending over backwards to help me out around the house. And I think he should, because it was partially his fault or rather his wife's fault.

It's really humiliating to be rejected sexually by your spouse. Charlotte wouldn't live with him, wouldn't fuck him, but would deign to have dinner with him on alternate weekends and go on vacations with him, as long as he paid, of course. What a selfish cunt! Charlotte always said she was a feminist. But what that really means is that women can do whatever they want without any sense of accountability. Who needs gender equality? I've shown more compassion and concern for Rob than his wife ever did. He should consider my needs, especially now when I'm laid up like this.

It just depresses me, and I'm depressed enough as it is. I know I'm a big disappointment. I don't need to have my face rubbed in it.

When we were seeing each other, he used to make dates and stand me up and then call me on the phone and hang up just to see if I was waiting for his call. I remember once, when I went to his place, he spent nearly an hour on the phone with some other woman and just ignored me until I started to walk out.

I didn't know he could reach those high notes! It was too bad I didn't order a Grande. I figured he wouldn't hit a cripple, so I taunted him, cooing, \"Aw, did that hurt?\" He pushed me hard, and I lost my balance and landed on the floor. He got on top of me, grabbed me by my throat, and screamed, \"You fucking bitch!\" I thought he was going to kill me. I couldn't breathe for what seemed like several minutes. I fumbled around in my bag for pepper spray--I always carry it. When I finally found it and managed to get my finger on the nozzle, I sprayed him in the face. I inhaled some of the spray, too; it is really horrible stuff! He got the worst of it, though. He was really screaming then! But he still wouldn't let go of my throat.

He had to defend himself against this little crippled woman half his size? Judging by the reaction of the people in Starbucks, most of them thought he was attacking me.

It happened in a flash. I didn't even have a chance to suppress it. When he touched my arm, all the anger I had swallowed, all the memories of how he used and abused me came back, all at once. Now I know what it means to be temporarily insane. I couldn't stop myself, even if I wanted to. But I wouldn't mind doing it again. I've had all kinds of sadistic fantasies ever since that day.

When I first began treating you, you said that your promiscuity led you to be somewhat asexual. In recent sessions, you've expressed a reawakening of sexual feelings, such as your attraction for Tony."}, {"instruction": "And now I'm expressing longing for house pets and farm animals, not to mention Scott Adams. This is terrible. I must be deranged.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, it seems that you're expressing a healthy interest in sex, which is quite normal."}, {"instruction": "Fucking dogs and horses is normal? Is that the Freudian view, or something? Isn't bestiality illegal? Maybe you're trying to set me up--you'll get me to bring pictures of me with the neighbor's dog and turn me over to the police.", "input": "", "output": "No, I would never do that. However, I will keep Portia locked up from now on."}, {"instruction": "Ha! I've never heard of people fucking cats. Maybe it's because their orifices are too small and they have such sharp claws.

I like cats though, just not that way.", "input": "", "output": "How discriminating--only the royalty of the pet food set."}, {"instruction": "Oh shut up. Now I wish I hadn't said anything about bestiality.", "input": "", "output": "Are you taking precautions with Tony?"}, {"instruction": "It's kind of hard to fuck with three limbs in casts, even if the other guy gets on top. Besides, we aren't doing anything that requires precautions, unless you're suggesting that I don rubber gloves and a bunny suit just to get felt up.", "input": "", "output": "How much do you know about Tony's sexual history?"}, {"instruction": "Not much. He said something about working at a leather store, so he's had some exposure to the S&M scene.", "input": "", "output": "What about Tony's HIV status? Have you asked him about that?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, no.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "What is this, the Inquisition? We're not exchanging fluids, except spit.", "input": "", "output": "You said that Tony might be gay or bi.

When you look at what people consider sexy, it's so subjective, so meaningless. It really doesn't make any sense. Sometimes, when I browse adult web sites, I find the photos curious or attractive, but always in a detached sort of way. The amateur adult sites--the ones where fat, ugly, ordinary people send in naked pictures of themselves and their wives--those are the most fascinating to me. Those people seem just like animals, following their baser instincts, shoving their crotches into the camera. It's both fascinating and repelling.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Looks like there's no more time for me to regale you with the inner workings of my twisted psyche, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Sharon.

It's a relief to be able to stand again.", "input": "", "output": "When did the casts come off?"}, {"instruction": "On Tuesday, I went to the doctor. They said my sprained ankle had healed, but I shouldn't put too much weight on it yet. The foot will take longer to heal because of the multiple broken bones. Tendons also take a long time to heal. I use the wheelchair most of the time because my ankle is still tender.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How's your wrist doing?"}, {"instruction": "It hurts, but the brace seems to help. I don't have a lot of dexterity in that hand. You were right about the ibuprofen--the high doses really ease the pain.

I decided to take a chance coming here on crutches today.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Please be careful. I'd hate to see you get into another accident."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. From now on, I won't throw hot coffee at offending ex-boyfriends.", "input": "", "output": "How was your week otherwise?"}, {"instruction": "A friend of Tony's made a disturbing comment a few days ago.

With all this free time, I find myself obsessing about every little thing.", "input": "", "output": "What did he say?"}, {"instruction": "Tony met with one of his pretty boy-toy friends after the Parade. His friend got food poisoning afterward from eating bad Chinese take-out. He was milking it for all the sympathy and attention he could get.

Hope you get better soon.\" But on the way home, I realized what he meant.", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "I think he was implying that Tony's HIV-positive. Or maybe Tony isn't, and Sick Fuck only wants me to think that he is. What a conniving little shit. I wonder if he planned that whole scenario--I'll bet he didn't even have food poisoning.", "input": "", "output": "I think the most logical solution would be to ask Tony directly."}, {"instruction": "Would that be making too much of this?

It's not a death sentence anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I think the claims of a cure are quite premature, I'm afraid.  Although the drug cocktails seem to work miracles in the short term, their long term use doesn't seem to be the answer due to some very odd and debilitating side effects.  HIV is a very serious disease and I'm concerned that you're not taking adequate precautions. And you also have Rob to think of: you don't want to infect him."}, {"instruction": "With the casts and all, I haven't exactly been the seductress lately. I don't have a very sexual relationship with either Tony or Rob.", "input": "", "output": "I still think you should talk to Tony about his sexual history. And you should also get yourself tested."}, {"instruction": "He hasn't demanded to know the size and circumference of every cock I've sucked. He could have judged me by my promiscuous past, but he didn't. If he's keeping his HIV status under wraps, that's his right. I'm really tired of hearing introductions like, \"Hi, I'm Homer, and I'm an HIV-positive incest survivor and a vegan.\" Boo-fucking-hoo. I have more respect for a person with HIV or AIDS who keeps it to himself and doesn't expect any special treatment.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  But this isn't about special treatment that Tony expects--I'm not talking about a plea for sympathy.  This is information you need to assess the risks that you're willing to take."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, right.  I wonder why Sick Fuck had to go and do that? Tony and I aren't a couple; I thought his friends knew that. Besides, most people aren't threatened by me. I'm hardly intimidating. I have an honest face, and I appear to be completely guileless.", "input": "", "output": "Only your therapist knows the awful truth."}, {"instruction": "Very funny.", "input": "", "output": "Look, Sharon, I can't force you to ask Tony anything, and I can't make you take an HIV test. But I must emphasize that having an HIV-positive sexual partner is a serious risk. You have a right to be informed, and asking him is perfectly reasonable. This issue is clearly troubling for you--you're obsessing about it. You could easily resolve it by asking Tony a simple question."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you have a point.", "input": "", "output": "End of lecture."}, {"instruction": "You'll never guess who came knocking at my door.", "input": "", "output": "Godzilla?"}, {"instruction": "How did you know?", "input": "", "output": "Just a lucky guess. Actually, I'm surprised, considering your last encounter."}, {"instruction": "I didn't expect it either. I think she's trying to convert me to that fruit loop New Age group. She invited me to some sort of born-again pagan ritual with her boyfriend. I tried to get out of it, but Godzilla said that she really wanted me to go--something about needing \"female energy.\" Her boyfriend--this tall Native-American guy young enough to be her son--didn't want to go either. He was tagging along because she was taking him to dinner afterward. I was a bit startled by him, he's an imposing presence. I could tell by his eyes he was on something--he had that stoner look. I thought maybe he could get me some weed.", "input": "", "output": "So you were attracted by the lure of food and marijuana?"}, {"instruction": "Hard to resist. This ritual was in Marin, of course, at this retreat that had some pseudo-Native-American-sounding name, like \"Make-um Heap Big Wampum Meditation Retreat.\" There are even more fruit loops over the Golden Gate Bridge than there are in San Francisco and the rest of the Bay Area. It was a really long drive. Godzilla blathered enthusiastically all the way there. The Stoner looked bored. I knew he couldn't wait to get high. I felt kind of sad at that point.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Because Godzilla was so happy and excited. I knew she wanted to have him there; she wanted to show him off. And I knew he didn't care about her, he was probably just using her. He wasn't in the same head space that she was, and he wasn't even self-aware enough to know that. Jeez, now I'm talking like one of them.", "input": "", "output": "You're assuming a lot about a man you just met. How much do you really know about their relationship?"}, {"instruction": "Usually, your first impressions are right on target. It turned out I was right. As soon as he got there, he said he had to go to the bathroom. I waited a few minutes, then followed him. It was hard to maneuver, because we were outdoors and the ground was uneven. Sure enough, he retreated into some trees behind the restrooms. He was startled when he saw me; he covered up his pipe and tried to act cool. I asked him if he needed a light, and he seemed relieved. Then I asked if he minded if I smoked some weed, and he brightened up. I shared a joint with him--I slipped one into my wallet before we left. He offered me a hit off his pipe, and I saw that he wasn't smoking weed.", "input": "", "output": "I have a feeling I'm not going to like this."}, {"instruction": "I only had a little hit. I did it to be polite, so he could trust me.", "input": "", "output": "It was crack, wasn't it?"}, {"instruction": "Very good, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Was that the first time you've smoked crack?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I don't see what the fuss is about. I heard how addictive it was--people are hooked after smoking it only once. It got me wired and very paranoid. It didn't last long, but I still didn't like it.", "input": "", "output": "I'm relieved to hear that."}, {"instruction": "When the sun set, a group of women started pounding on drums. I knew about flaky New Age devotees in Marin, but I've never seen so many in one place. When they started chanting this ugga-mugga pseudo-Native-American song, I couldn't stop laughing. The Stoner got a kick out of my hysterics, and he laughed a little, too. To stop giggling, I had to think of sad things, like starving children in North Korea.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did anyone notice that the two of you were stoned?"}, {"instruction": "Nah. It was outdoors, and they were burning sage--the whole area was smelly. And we weren't the only ones who were stoned; I smelled marijuana a few times. I also saw a lot of dark eyes. I'd heard that fruit loops favored organic hallucinogenics like psilocybin. I could see how this was a good place to trip. After the initial giggling fit, I calmed down and the drums really got to me. They were almost hypnotic. I looked up at the sky which was incredibly clear. I felt like the night sky was pushing down on my face, while the sound of the drums and voices was compressing me from the sides.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I must have stared up at the sky for a long time--my neck really hurt afterward. By the time it was over, it was after midnight.", "input": "", "output": "What sort of ceremony was this?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It was one of those earth-hugging rain-dance kind of things where everyone chants \"wunga-wunga.\" On the way home, Godzilla asked what I thought of it. I told her she had a great voice--she sang during the ceremony. She beamed with approval. I didn't tell her that I thought she sounded like an animal wailing in pain. Maybe if she had sung \"Amazing Grace,\" I would have been more impressed. I also told her the drumming and chanting was exciting and got my heart pounding.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I also told her she was radiant, that she glowed like a woman who'd just had the best orgasm of her life. I knew she loved that; she was very pleased. I felt like a big bag of shit after I said it.", "input": "", "output": "Were you lying?"}, {"instruction": "She did have a goddess-like serenity about her. I didn't want to bring her down by telling the truth--I was stoned and goofing on the whole scene. This probably makes me a real asshole. But there's no point in beating myself up about it because she didn't take us to dinner--the whole thing ended so late.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "She did say she wanted me to accompany her again, and I told her I would like that.", "input": "", "output": "Really? In previous sessions, you've expressed nothing but scorn and contempt for those who subscribe New Age beliefs."}, {"instruction": "I'd like to learn more about it so I can make fun of it more effectively. This experience led me to conclude that all religion is really whacked and thus ripe fodder for derision. Christianity is no weirder than any of this neo-pagan shit. If you look at the symbols and rituals of Christian religions, they're just as bizarre, like the crucifix that Catholics wear. You always hear people making fun of Hindus for the dots on their heads, but a cross is just as ridiculous. What's the point of wearing a metal representation of an ancient form of torture? If Jesus had been stoned to death, would we be wearing little rocks around our necks? Good thing the electric chair wasn't invented then, because the Pope-ski would look even sillier if he wore a big gold chair on a chain. I've never understood why Catholics have such reverence for an old bald guy with a drag queen's fashion sense. Spiritual leader, my ass. Louis Farrakhan was right when he called him \"a no-good cracker.\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Modern-day paganism is just as nonsensical as any other belief system. But at least you can get stoned at their ceremonies.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I can see that's a plus."}, {"instruction": "It would be cool to start my own religion. I could call them \"Sharon's Witnesses.\" I'd dispense my followers to suburban neighborhoods to distribute cheap mimeographed copies of my obscenity-laden rants.", "input": "", "output": "You're really quite creative, Sharon. If you could only channel that energy into something constructive...have you thought about finding a creative outlet?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'd like to get up on a stage and smear chocolate frosting on my tits while shoving yams up my ass.", "input": "", "output": "That's been done."}, {"instruction": "Not by a cripple.", "input": "", "output": "I think your handicap would get in the way, at least for now."}, {"instruction": "I knew you'd nix the yam thing.

There was a long silence, and he got this look on his face. Tony said he'd been meaning to tell me but kept putting it off. He wasn't sure why he kept it a secret from me; all his other friends knew. I told Tony it was his friend's remark that tipped me off. I wished I hadn't said anything.", "input": "", "output": "You were justified in asking him, even if it did make him uncomfortable."}, {"instruction": "Remember the news story about that young drug dealer on the East Coast? This was several months ago. They were calling him a modern-day typhoid Mary; he infected dozens of young girls with HIV. Worst of all, he knew he was doing it--he admitted to the police that he kept a scorecard in his head like it was a game. I thought he was a truly evil person.", "input": "", "output": "I think I do remember reading about that. How do you feel about Tony now, knowing that he withheld his HIV status from you?"}, {"instruction": "At first, I was furious with him and with myself. Then I realized Tony wasn't acting out of malice. I think our relationship was a way of escape for him; with me, he could get high, play, and pretend that nothing was wrong. That's probably why he spent so much time with me--it was a form of denial. It makes sense, in a twisted sort of way.", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to continue having Tony as a sexual partner?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not going to reject him just because he's HIV-positive. Tony was really down after I told him. He'd been in a fight with Sick Fuck--the one who tipped me off. Tony looked so miserable with his chipped tooth and bruised face. I decided the least I could do was cheer him up.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by that?"}, {"instruction": "Tony was going to sell some of my things for me--he works at that leather store. I've got some relics from my past life that I'd like to get rid of. Tony said that if they were in good condition, I could get a fair price for them. The disability checks aren't very much. I have all this free time and no pocket money. That's why Tony came by--to take a look.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So he came over and we took bong hits until we were both baked. Tony brought a big Nordstrom's shopping bag with him. He opened it up and inside was a leather corset. It was really quite beautiful in a black minimalist way. I liked the simple lines and the lacing at the back. The corset was surprisingly heavy; it felt important, like an artifact or something.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I thought you were interested in getting rid of some stuff..."}, {"instruction": "Well, Tony cajoled and teased, and he finally got me to try it on. He had to help me get into it and lace up the back. Even though we'd been intimate before, I felt embarrassed standing in front of him wearing nothing but the corset and a cast. It was an under-the-bust corset, so I was almost naked except for the expanse of leather cinching my waist. He tight-laced the back, pulling it closed. It gave me a little head rush. I'd heard about corset fetishists enjoying that sensation, but it always sounded very nonerotic to me--like being squeezed by a boa constrictor. I was surprised that I found it arousing.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Tony sat on the bed and looked up at me and said I was stunning--he'd always wanted to see me like that. He ran his hand along the inside of my thigh.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon..."}, {"instruction": "I slapped him and told him he hadn't been given permission to touch me.", "input": "", "output": "You did?"}, {"instruction": "Then I grabbed a handful of his hair, pulled his head back, and told him that I wanted him naked on his knees on the floor. When he smiled at me, I knew that was what he wanted all along. I slapped him again--harder this time--and said, \"Now!\"", "input": "", "output": "Have you and Tony done this sort of role-playing before?"}, {"instruction": "No, but I knew he wanted it.", "input": "", "output": "Did you also want it or were you just doing it for Tony's benefit?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Yeah, maybe I did. While he undressed, I dug through the box of stuff that I was planning to sell and found the harness.", "input": "", "output": "A harness?"}, {"instruction": "A strap-on. It's a leather thong designed to hold a dildo.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did you take precautions?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I knew what I was doing. I've done this before. As I secured the strap-on in place, Tony looked to see what I was doing. I reprimanded him and told him to turn around and face the bed. He did as he was told. I spanked him again, and he inched his knees apart. I kicked the inside of his legs apart until there was nearly a foot between them.", "input": "", "output": "Did Tony..."}, {"instruction": "I could tell he was aroused--men have a hard time hiding that fact when they're naked. I was turned on, too. I could feel myself getting wet, I could even smell it.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, it sounds like you were about to get a lot more intimate with an HIV-positive man. Were you prepared? Did you think of the consequences?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I've got everything I needed. Don't worry, Doctor. So once I had Tony over the bed, I secured his wrists together in front of him with the leather restraints. I put a pillow on the bed, pushed his face into it, and told him to hold that position and keep quiet. I reddened his bottom with my hand until he moaned and squirmed.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon..."}, {"instruction": "Then I stroked him, teasing him with my hand while pressing my tits against his back.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon..."}, {"instruction": "It was exciting! I could hardly believe what I was doing. I remembered all the things that were done to me--what those sensations were like. I was surprised I had such confidence; I knew exactly what to do. I remembered how much I loved the smell of leather. I took a leather flogger, pulled him back by his hair, and trailed the falls of the whip across his face--I wanted Tony to smell it, too. I pushed him down into the pillow and trailed the ends of the whip over his ass and across his back. I could tell by the way his legs and back muscles tightened that his anticipation was building.", "input": "", "output": "I see. But..."}, {"instruction": "I whipped him on the ass and back, starting slowly and building up gradually, harder and harder, until he brought his knees together. His shoulder blades and back were deep red.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't break skin, did you?"}, {"instruction": "No, certainly not.  I paused to press my nipples against his back and give him a few teasing strokes with my hand. He was breathing hard, and I could feel his pulse racing. I told him to hold still, that I would be right back. When he nodded, I gave him a spank and said, \"What?\" And he replied, \"Yes, Mistress.\"", "input": "", "output": "Was this the first time you've been in the dominant position?"}, {"instruction": "I guess. I did some of these actions before, but only on the orders of my master. This time...", "input": "", "output": "How did it make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I felt this ringing, buzzing sensation in my head. It was kind of like having too many margaritas. I was very aroused. My heart was pounding, but I felt completely calm. I also felt powerless, in a way. I couldn't stop what was happening.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did you..."}, {"instruction": "I took a bottle of lubricant and put it on the bed, next to him, so he could see it.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, I appreciate the detailed account, but I want to know if you used..."}, {"instruction": "I told him to turn around on his knees and face me. I stepped forward and told him to suck it.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, you're not answering my question. Did you use any precautions at this time?"}, {"instruction": "I made him work; I pushed it into his throat, until he started choking.", "input": "", "output": "Choking? Did you know..."}, {"instruction": "Yes, of course I knew what I was doing. It wasn't my first time, Doctor. I've been on the receiving end of forced deep-throating lots of times, and I'm still here. And it didn't last very long. I took it out when he started gagging. I just did it to make him feel powerless.", "input": "", "output": "Like you feel when it's done to you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I wasn't going to suffocate him. Then I told him I wanted him over the bed; Tony wanted it, too.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure? Did you always want what your master told you to do?"}, {"instruction": "Tony assumed the position right away. I lubricated the dildo and...", "input": "", "output": "Did you take precautions, Sharon?"}, {"instruction": "You're ruining my story, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Sorry. But..."}, {"instruction": "And I eased into him. As he relaxed, I pushed in slowly until I was completely inside him.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, did you take precautions? Sharon?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? I didn't think we needed to.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure what the protocol is for this type of activity, but I think you're taking too many risks."}, {"instruction": "I was careful. I used a generous amount of lubricant on both him and myself to decrease the possibility of rents and tears.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes..."}, {"instruction": "I was very careful, Doctor. And why are you so keen on reducing everything to such sterile terms: \"Did you use precautions? Did you gag him safely? How much lubricant did you use?\" Why don't you relax and enjoy it, Doctor? I did. And so did Tony. I brought him close a few times with my hand while the dildo was still inside of him. When I withdrew my hand, he begged me to touch him. He moaned loudly, his body tensed, and then he went limp. That was it. Happy now?", "input": "", "output": "How did you feel afterwards?"}, {"instruction": "Weak and lightheaded. I had to sit down, my mind was reeling. Tony turned toward me and I held him for a long time and stroked his hair. I felt this wave of emotions; I wanted to cry.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "It was weird. I was so out of it, like my soul had left my body or something. Tony, on the other hand, was completely blissful. He nuzzled me like a baby. I wanted him to put his arms around me; and it took me a while to realize he was still in the restraints. I unbuckled them, and as I looked down we were both covered...well, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did Tony..."}, {"instruction": "Reciprocate? Make up your mind, Doctor, do you want details or not?", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, I..."}, {"instruction": "What is it then--just professional curiosity? Well actually, Doctor, I'll have to disappoint you--I didn't want Tony to reciprocate.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Why not?"}, {"instruction": "It's not what I wanted at that moment, maybe next time...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did you clean yourselves up immediately afterwards?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't want to ruin the moment. It was kind of nice to languish while covered in come after sex. We did clean up eventually.", "input": "", "output": "Did you use a disinfectant? Rubbing alcohol, perhaps..."}, {"instruction": "Jesus Christ! What do you want me to do, treat Tony like he's the Toxic Avenger? Something tells me you're a real smooth operator in the bedroom, Doctor. I'll bet you drive the chicks wild with your latex gloves and disinfectant spray. We used soap and water, both known as effective against HIV and a host of other germs and viruses. I didn't have time to scrub him down with Lysol, I had to get him out of the house in a hurry--I didn't want Rob to walk in on us.", "input": "", "output": "I'm dismayed by your cavalier attitude towards safe sex, Sharon, especially when you have a partner who is HIV-positive. From what you just described, you came in contact with his body fluids. HIV can be transmitted through semen.

If it will make you feel better, I'll soak my little silicone friend in a bucket of disinfectant, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I'm not sure what would be safe for the scene you described.  Putting a condom on the dildo doesn't sound like it's going to make it all that much safer.  Maybe you could use one of those vaginal shields.  That might make more sense.  And cut out anything with a whip that might cut into the skin and flail blood around."}, {"instruction": "Great.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Sharon, I'll drop it for now. But in the future, I'd like you to be more vigilant about using protective barriers. You can buy rubbing alcohol at almost any store; it may not be romantic, but it's cheap and effective. It's always good to take a few moments to make sure you're exercising all possible precautions."}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me more about how this made you feel."}, {"instruction": "Well, while I was doing it, I could almost feel what Tony was feeling. I was experiencing his sensations vicariously...is that the right word?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it is. You said you've dominated other men before at their request. Did you enjoy those experiences?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I did what they wanted me to do to appease them. It was more like a friendly gesture. I didn't get off on it like I did this time.", "input": "", "output": "Well, judging by the way you described your encounter with Tony, it seems that you enjoyed it."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I haven't felt a rush that intense in years. I forgot all about my injuries. My wrist isn't completely healed yet. But while I was swinging the whip, I didn't feel even a twinge of pain. It didn't start to hurt until later that night. It's really killing me now. My feet and legs ache, too. I must have been standing for awhile without leaning against anything.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you regret what you did?"}, {"instruction": "I'm still surprised. But no, I don't regret it.", "input": "", "output": "How about Tony?"}, {"instruction": "He's practically doing cartwheels. He can't wait to see me again. I'm feeling some performance anxiety.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I'll have to keep coming up with more elaborate scenarios to keep him interested. He's not just my buddy anymore. I feel like now I have to impress him.", "input": "", "output": "And how does that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, it was kind of fun. I really liked the fact that I could control and manipulate him. I even enjoyed inflicting pain, watching him flinch when I whipped him. I thought Tony would think that what we did was pretty tame. He's played with men before, and they're known for roughness.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about the prospect of doing this again?"}, {"instruction": "I'm ambivalent. I thought I wasn't going to do this again.

Thanks, Doctor. See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Hi. I guess Rob told you, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I spoke to him.  He told me he was going to bail you out of jail."}, {"instruction": "Are you going to help write a case history for my lawyer?

I read a magazine article about featuring an interview with Pauline Kael; she was a critic for the New Yorker. I've been reading one of her books--a collection of her reviews. This woman is full of shit! Where the fuck does this dried-up old cunt get off dissing Woody Allen?", "input": "", "output": "I fail to see how this relates to your recent drug experimentation."}, {"instruction": "I knew a film student who raved about how great she was. I'd always wanted to read her reviews, and now I wish I hadn't. I don't think I'll be able to enjoy movies the same way anymore. \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" was one of my favorite films of all time. I watched it over and over again. Kael had the unmitigated gall to say that the characterizations were thin. She called Bukowski a \"poseur\" in her review of \"Barfly.\" Blasphemy! Bukowski's more of a real writer than she could ever be.", "input": "", "output": "Let's try to stay on the subject."}, {"instruction": "I'm getting to the point. Pauline Kael has poisoned my mind. I was so disgusted after reading her book. It was as if she drained all the joy out of going to the movies. I picked up her infuriating habit of dissecting every element of the film into bits and pieces, instead of taking it in as a whole. She's so caught up in acting the part of a learned and well-read intellectual, that she completely misses the point. Now I can't even watch daytime television without seeing it as an elaborate metaphor for the decline of twentieth century civilization. Jerry Springer is a modern-day Roman circus, whereas Jenny Jones, with her costumed characters and musical interludes from has-been rock stars, has a more surreal quality. Rick Lake is an unctuous gas bag with delusions of grandeur--she actually thinks she's helping people. Did you know Geraldo's daytime show is going off the air?", "input": "", "output": "Really."}, {"instruction": "What am I going to do without his Friday celebrity gossip show? Who's going to cover Zippergate? Geraldo's absence will create a void no one else could fill. Rosie O'Donnell can't hold a candle to him, I don't care if she did get the Daytime Emmy.", "input": "", "output": "Let's get off this tangent and get back on track. What drove you to cultivate and then consume massive amounts of hallucinogenics?"}, {"instruction": "After reading Pauline Kael's film reviews, I wanted to cleanse my head, like that rabbit song.

I wish they did eat it all, then I wouldn't have to clean it up.", "input": "", "output": "I think the line is: \"Feed your head.\" Yes, rabbits do eat some of their own feces, it's nature's way of giving them the necessary B-vitamins and protein."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, whatever. Anyway, the plan was that I would trip with Tony while seeing \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\" Only I took too much and freaked out. When we got out of the theater, the sky was dark, and for some reason that really scared me. Tony maintained much better than I did--he didn't take as much. He guided me across the street to the Zephyr Cafe, which I usually find a soothing environment. But I couldn't go in; I couldn't stand the thought of being confined indoors.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I was overcome by this irrational fear. I stayed outside and looked in the window at the display of coffee mugs until I got really cold. Tony finally dragged me in and took me to a table. I closed my eyes and that was a big mistake. I saw these giant eyes staring back at me in reverse video--my pupils where white and the whites were black. Then I saw little ants and worms crawling out of my eyes and remembered a story I heard in high school about some kid who had clawed his eyes out while on acid. I panicked and started screaming, and Tony took me home. I felt like I was going to die, like I was having a heart attack. Tony tried to talk me out of calling 911, but I did it anyway. He got the hell out of there.", "input": "", "output": "What happened then?"}, {"instruction": "The police came. I thought they would take me to a hospital, but they handcuffed me and took me to jail instead. I spent the night in the drunk tank with a couple of really skanky-looking prostitutes and a smelly homeless woman who shouted obscenities while rocking back and forth. It was surreal.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Was this the first time you've taken psilocybin?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure it was actually psilocybin. I've been working on the mold project for a while. I took some before, a week ago, when I got my first crop of mold. It wasn't anything like the last time--then, I watched TV and laughed my ass off. The first time, I was a little nervous and paranoid when I started to peak, but it was okay.", "input": "", "output": "Wasn't it psilocybin that you took?"}, {"instruction": "No, it was just spores from the mold. I never actually grew mushrooms. I'm really disappointed that the cops took all my jars. It was a lot of work. I had to sterilize everything and haul jugs of distilled water from the store to water the rye berries.", "input": "", "output": "How did you know how to do this?"}, {"instruction": "There are mushroom-growing guides all over the Net. Someone called \"Psilly Simon\" has a very thorough description on his web page. It's pretty complicated. I should have paid more attention in my chemistry class.

You wanted me to find a creative outlet, and growing mold and fungi is creating new life, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "You know that's not what I meant."}, {"instruction": "I've never been much for growing things, not even marijuana plants. They're supposed to be weeds, but I can never get them to produce buds. When I saw the white fuzz forming on those rye berries, I was overjoyed.

Your psychological state didn't render you delusional."}, {"instruction": "It was all for personal use. The crime lab still hasn't determined if what I produced is a recognized drug. Do you know what they took as evidence? A little plastic dieter's scale from Weight Watchers. It was Charlotte's--she was always on a diet. What a joke! Real drug dealers don't use a scale like that, they use a triple-beam balance or a digital scale. If that's the only evidence they have of intent to sell, they've got a flimsy case. I don't know why law enforcement even bothers to come after me. I'm no threat to society. Why don't they chase after crack dealers who sell to school children?", "input": "", "output": "That's not the point, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Yes, it is. America's \"War On Drugs\" is a national disgrace. \"Just Say No\"--what an insipid slogan. We should string up that old bag Nancy Reagan and hang her next to Pauline Kael, and gut them both like a couple of tunas. This \"no-nothing\" mania sweeping the country is completely out of hand. They're even coming after people who smoke tobacco. Where would the South be without tobacco? We're really shooting ourselves in the foot here. Didn't we learn anything after the Prohibition? How much money has the government spent on the drug war? With all the social problems we have, why not let the smokers smoke and the stoners get stoned and spend our tax dollars on something important, like national health care.", "input": "", "output": "The..."}, {"instruction": "Do you know how many Deadheads are rotting away in prison for selling acid?

At the end, she lays naked in the bathtub, smeared with feces, and sings Broadway show tunes while the camera guy takes a piss on her. One of the guys in the chat room told me about it.

What did Tony do?"}, {"instruction": "He made reservations for us at a gender-bender party. These parties are held every month in an old Victorian house. We went shopping first, which was a lot of fun. Tony knows a store in the Haight that sells clothes for strippers and prostitutes. He picked out this see-through white mesh mini-dress. He was going to wear a pink satin thong under it and a pair of matching pink stilettos. This is a great city to live in if you're looking for a size nine high heels.", "input": "", "output": "It certainly is."}, {"instruction": "Tony sprung a huge erection when he saw himself in the dressing room mirror. I stood behind him and stroked it while he watched. I told him not to touch it for the rest of the day; he only had permission to touch when he peed and then only for two shakes.

I was very careful.", "input": "", "output": "I suspect you have more prurient reasons for detailing your exploits."}, {"instruction": "You say that like it's a bad thing. After we went shopping, we picked up champagne and bubble bath on the way to Tony's house. Tony wanted to shave his legs, and I convinced him it was better for me to do it. We took turns with the bong and drank a few glasses of bubbly while waiting for the tub to fill. When Tony got in, I sat on the edge of the tub and covered my cast with a towel to keep it from getting wet. I took a soapy washcloth and worked it all over his body. He was very excited--hard as a rock. I enjoyed teasing him and telling him not to come until the party that night. I could have hung a plant from his penis. He stayed hard for most of the bath, even when I shaved his balls.", "input": "", "output": "You did?"}, {"instruction": "He wanted to really look the part of a girl, so all his body hair had to come off. He would have done anything for me; he was in a very submissive frame of mind. After the bath, he got dressed and made-up. He had lipstick in the same shimmering pink to match the thong and heels and he wore a blonde wig. I borrowed Tony's clothes: a suit, a dress shirt, and a tie. I pulled my hair back into a ponytail. It was hard to walk with the crutches, but it looked better than the wheelchair. I wasn't very convincing, but I liked the idea that we were both cross-dressing. And guess who came by as we were leaving?", "input": "", "output": "Who?"}, {"instruction": "The Sick Fuck--Tony's jealous friend. He was livid; he looked like he was ready to kill us both. I can't believe that guy is so obsessed with Tony and me. Tony says he already has a boyfriend and maybe a girlfriend. What more could he want? Does he need a sheep, too? That's kind of greedy if you ask me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So we arrived at the party a little late. Tony was nervous and excited. He kept checking his make-up in the mirror. The inside of the house had been converted into a dungeon: there was a rack, stocks, a sling, and a large padded bondage table. I spotted a large iron cage against a mirrored wall at the far end of the house. I used leather restraints to fasten Tony to the cage--his arms over his head and his legs as far apart as they could go. There was a mirror inside the cage, and I told him to watch what I was doing. Soon, he was bursting out of his pink thong.", "input": "", "output": "Did you and Tony negotiate any of this?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not in so many words. I knew he wanted to be publicly beaten and humiliated. I planned to give him what he wanted, maybe a little more. While I was tying him, several drag queens gathered around to watch. Tony could see them in the mirror. I lifted up his dress, pulled his thong aside, and fingered him. I told him everyone watching would take turns doing what they pleased with him.", "input": "", "output": "Did you disclose Tony's HIV status to the other party participants?"}, {"instruction": "No, but Doctor...", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, you might be into playing games like that, but you can't lead others..."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure Tony wasn't the only positive one there. We all knew what we're doing, Doctor.

So Tony made a some half-hearted protests, but I knew he wanted...", "input": "", "output": "How can you be sure?"}, {"instruction": "Erections don't lie. He was breathing hard and was clearly excited by the idea of all those people watching and touching him. But I would have stopped if he told me to. I lifted up his dress and whipped him with a long leather flogger until his back and bottom were deep pink. Then I switched to a small, sharp whip and snapped it on his inner thighs and at his crotch until he pleaded with me to stop.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did you stop?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, of course I did. I did just enough to terrorize him. After that, I untied him and told him to get on the floor, on his hands and knees. I placed a riding crop on the opposite end of the room and told him to crawl across the room and bring it back to me in his teeth, so I could beat him with it. I smacked him on the ass and said, \"Go!\" One of the drag queens, a tall Rita Hayworth-type, couldn't take her eyes off him as he made his way across the room.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "When Tony returned, I reprimanded him for putting teeth marks on the crop. I made him lean back, still kneeling and rest his weight on his hands. I slapped his nipples and crotch with the crop until he gasped in pain. Then I ordered him to reach into his thong and hold his balls out for me while I whipped them.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds dangerous. Did Tony have a safe word?"}, {"instruction": "He was okay. He had a lot of experience. He could have said \"Red\"--a common safe word meaning stop. There is also a party safe word: \"Safe word.\" Calling out \"Safe word\" is a signal to the dungeon monitor that things are getting out of hand.", "input": "", "output": "A dungeon monitor?"}, {"instruction": "It's the S&M version of a school hall monitor. There's usually more than one. Their job is to walk around the dungeon and watch what people are doing. They enforce the safe sex rules, too.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, all S&M parties do. We need to use condoms for sex, even for oral sex. We have to wear a glove for intimate touching. There's usually a table with condoms, gloves, and lubricants as a courtesy to the players. But everyone is encouraged to bring their own.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I was surprised when the dungeon monitor came over and asked about the inflatable gag.", "input": "", "output": "What's an inflatable gag?"}, {"instruction": "It's a specialty item; Tony ordered it from Europe. It's a gag with a pump-like mechanism to inflate the mouthpiece.", "input": "", "output": "What's the purpose of an item like that?"}, {"instruction": "It feels good. You can pump it up so it fills your entire mouth. It muffles screams and makes the wearer feel powerless. The black drag queen, Tasha, said that Tony made too much noise and needed a gag. I was afraid the dungeon monitor wouldn't let us use it, because inflatable gags have killed people who hadn't used them properly. But our dungeon monitor said that as long as Tony could breathe and had some sort of \"safe signal,\" it was okay.", "input": "", "output": "What was Tony's safe signal?"}, {"instruction": "Tony's signal was two stomps on the floor. He could have also raise his left hand. One always needs a safe signal when using a gag.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Tasha gagged Tony and stroked him, making him very hard. Then, she sliced a long, bamboo cane through the air, and when Tony looked up at the \"swoosh\" sound, Velvet smacked him on the ass and told him to keep his head down.", "input": "", "output": "Velvet?"}, {"instruction": "There were a quite a few people interested in Tony.", "input": "", "output": "And was it all right with you?"}, {"instruction": "I like to share, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Did you enjoy watching them?"}, {"instruction": "I found it arousing. I liked the fact that I helped orchestrate it, but didn't have to do a lot of work.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Was all of this sharing okay with Tony?"}, {"instruction": "He was hard and didn't complain when they started to fuck him.", "input": "", "output": "Did these women use condoms?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, they had to. They throw you out if you don't.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And when we finally allowed Tony to come, I held bunched-up tissues to the end of his cock. You're not supposed to get semen anywhere, except in a condom. I thought the tissues were a good compromise. I wrapped them up in a glove and threw them away afterward.", "input": "", "output": "How did you feel afterwards?"}, {"instruction": "I got a kind of a rush from all this that lasted a few days.", "input": "", "output": "How about Tony?"}, {"instruction": "He was elated, he couldn't wipe the shit-eating grin off his face. He was a little wobbly afterward--his knees were bruised. He had to take off his shoes to walk to the car. On the way home, he said his mind and body had turned to mush. He was very affectionate, too. It was kind of sweet.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. That was the first S&M event you've been to in some time. What was it like to return to the S&M community?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if one party means I've returned. I don't think I'll make a regular habit of it. This was a special occasion. I had fun while I was there, but being there also reminded me of why I wanted to distance myself.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by that?"}, {"instruction": "There were two dykes watching us, and they made a few disparaging remarks loud enough for us to hear. They said things like: \"We should show them how to give a real whipping.\" They made catty remarks that the guys in drag weren't \"real women.\" I thought they were very rude. It's considered bad S&M party behavior to talk loudly and distract the players.", "input": "", "output": "How did their comments make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Angry and disgusted. But that sort of petty criticism is very common in the community. These bitches didn't even play, they just stood around and made rude comments. They didn't contribute anything to the atmosphere and trashed those who did. That reminded me of how intolerant people in the S&M community can be.", "input": "", "output": "I remember you mentioned this before."}, {"instruction": "It's like the gay community is always waving around that damned rainbow, but they don't grasp that it's meant to be a symbol of diversity. In the S&M community, like in the gay community, people are expected to conform to a strict standard of how to dress, what to say, how to act. They're always trying to outdo each other with more extreme scenarios, to the point where what they do isn't even erotic, it's just grotesque. I've watched the leather dykes who play really hard, and they aren't into what they're doing. Their eyes don't glaze over like someone having an endorphin rush. They're watching the crowd for peoples' reactions--it's all for shock value.

Do I look Mexican to you?", "input": "", "output": "Why do you ask?"}, {"instruction": "I just got back from the Mission.

I don't know what's worse.", "input": "", "output": "They're just asking for help. I sense an oncoming rant."}, {"instruction": "I went to the hospital this morning, to take some more X-rays. Half the staff there speaks Spanish because they have so many Spanish-speaking patients. The X-ray technician was Mexican. Her accent was so thick I could've scooped up her consonants with a tortilla chip. She wanted me in all these weird positions. You'd have to be a contortionist to do what she wanted.

He'd be there waiting for me when I got home from work. He wasn't very articulate, I'm not sure if many five-year-olds are. He seemed a little slow for his age.", "input": "", "output": "Did you like spending time with Kyle?"}, {"instruction": "Even that question sounds prurient, but I know that's not what you mean. I could identify with him. You didn't need a Ph.D. to figure out that this kid had serious problems at home. He was a spaced-out little tyke with a vacant stare, as if he was on Valium. His mother had primitive methods of child care--she used to leave her kids slack-jawed in front of the TV all day.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Once, I came home and found the baby wandering around in the street. A toddler in diapers in the middle of the street! I picked her up and took her home. Her mother didn't even know she was gone. Mrs. Piggy was the neighborhood babysitter; she provided day-care to about a dozen kids. She couldn't even keep her own rug rat out of the street, and yet she charged money to take care of other people's children.", "input": "", "output": "Was it this incident that made you call CPS?"}, {"instruction": "No, it was actually something else. I came home one day and found their cat bleeding and injured at my door. I ran to see if the Mrs. Piggy was home. She wasn't. The apartment reeked of marijuana, and the babysitter was asleep on the couch. When I went back to the apartment, I saw the kids poking and prodding at the cat. I was very upset. I yelled at them to go home. Finally, their pot head babysitter heard me screaming and asked what was wrong. I told her to watch the fucking kids and took the cat to the SPCA.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What happened after that?"}, {"instruction": "The cat was put to sleep; he was hit by a car.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "The Pigs couldn't even take care of a fucking cat, much less children. They didn't even feed it half the time--that's why it came to my house, I fed it. That's when I decided I'd had enough of their minimalist approach to child-rearing. I called Child Protective Services the next day.", "input": "", "output": "And what happened?"}, {"instruction": "The CPS operator didn't even care. She said if a child was in an immediate danger, I should call the police. I didn't bother pursuing it. If they don't care about their own kids, why should I? Now I think I should have put up more of a fight.", "input": "", "output": "What is your greatest fear about testifying in this case?"}, {"instruction": "That they'll use the \"nuts and sluts\" strategy and say I'm not credible. They'll dig up my sordid past, my involvement with the S&M community, all the guys I slept with. I read an article about a case where a rape victim's gynecological records were subpoenaed--they wanted to see if she had any venereal diseases. What if they ask me about my sexual history at the deposition?", "input": "", "output": "You should bring an attorney of your own to the deposition. You can call Legal Aid, they provide legal services at a sliding scale."}, {"instruction": "What if they make me take a polygraph test? I've heard the new tests are almost foolproof. What if I get nervous and fuck up and I'm branded a liar?", "input": "", "output": "To my knowledge, you can't be forced to take a polygraph test, and they are not admissible in court. Your lawyer can advise you on this, too."}, {"instruction": "One of the web sites had a list of characteristics of pedophiles. As I read the list, I realized a lot of the terms described me. There were specific things to look for: impulse control problems, substance abuse, history of sexual abuse, obsessive tendencies. I can't remember all of them.", "input": "", "output": "It's the father that's being accused, isn't it?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, the wife filed for divorce and used the \"abuse excuse\" to keep Pig Pen away from her and the piglets.", "input": "", "output": "You're not the one being accused in this case. But I'm not an expert in this field. You should talk to an attorney. Your history and personal life may not be an issue."}, {"instruction": "What if the attorney wants to use my testimony to defend Pig Pen? That's sickening. I don't want to defend that piece of shit.", "input": "", "output": "You'd just be testifying as to what you saw and heard.  That may be as damaging to Pig Pen as it is to his wife.  You're a witness, not an advocate."}, {"instruction": "I'd almost forgotten about this. I was really upset when it first happened. I was fuming with hatred for both Pigs for months after the cat incident. I kept thinking of ways I could get revenge.", "input": "", "output": "Were you able to work through some of your anger against them?"}, {"instruction": "I kept telling myself that their lives were more fucked up than mine. The Pigs were trapped in lower-middle-class hell with two kids, not enough money, and a growing pile of debts. Mrs. Piggy used to be pretty, but she gained over a hundred pounds after having the kids. She was uneducated and had no job skills. She got pregnant as a teenager and was married right away. She didn't have a lot of options. I didn't think she would ever leave Pig Pen, no matter how badly he treated her.", "input": "", "output": "Did you witness any domestic violence or abuse?"}, {"instruction": "Pig Pen's abuse was verbal not physical, but it was bad enough. He would curse and scream insults at his wife until she broke down crying. He did this in front of the kids. I'd hate to think my testimony would help him secure visitation rights. I wish a nice couple would adopt those kids.", "input": "", "output": "I understand your feelings, but there is a limit to what you can do. For now, I want you to focus on your testimony. Talking to an attorney of your own--preferably one with a background in family law--will help you put this in perspective. The relaxation exercises on the tape will help reduce the anxiety and stress you're feeling. You might find it helpful to do the exercises before the deposition."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I can always lock myself in a bathroom stall and do it there. I'm surprised it really works, and it only takes a few minutes.", "input": "", "output": "I realize this is an upsetting event, but we're almost out of time, Sharon.

The service can reach me when I'm not here."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome. Goodbye, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Hi. What happened to you last week?", "input": "", "output": "I had a family emergency, I'm sorry that I had to cancel our appointments. Did you call Legal Aid?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I did. I paid fifty bucks to whine to this sensitive, pony-tailed guy in a wrinkled shirt named Fielding Walker. What kind of parents give their kid two last names? He looked so young, I didn't think he'd know what he was doing, but he had a lot of experience with family law. I felt a lot calmer after talking to him.", "input": "", "output": "Was he able to advise you on your testimony?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, Fielding assured me that it was unlikely that I would be charged with any criminal act. I thought I was going on trial as a child molester--I guess that wasn't very rational of me. He said the charges my landlord and his wife made were clearly fabricated because of the circumstances. They only made the accusation when I complained about the condition of my apartment, and they wanted to get me out of there and keep my deposit. My landlord said the false accusation was his wife's idea. When she used the same accusation to get rid of him, he decided to use me to back up his story.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I kept a journal at the time, and that helps my credibility. I know exactly when the events happened, I even wrote down the times. That was when I first started seeing you; you recommended that I keep a journal.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "Fielding coached me on how to act at my deposition--don't volunteer any information and only answer the question posed to me. We went through a practice session--he asked me questions, and then helped me with my responses.", "input": "", "output": "How was the deposition?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Fielding said that my sexual history wouldn't matter, but I expected the worst. The other lawyer didn't ask about my sex life or anything too personal. Pig Pen's lawyer made certain that I specified that his wife made the accusation and told me to get out. I told the truth, but I felt dirty about it. I knew they were using me to corroborate his story. They were trying to discredit his wife, saying she'd made false accusations in the past.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Fielding said that if the case went to court, I might be asked if I witnessed any domestic violence or abuse. There's a chance that my credibility may come under scrutiny in the courtroom. They might ask about my history as a slut, an S&M devotee, a heroin addict, a psilocybin-cultivator, and a mental patient. He said if that came up, the defense could make a motion to suppress it. I'm hoping I won't have to testify in the trial. I wish this would all go away.", "input": "", "output": "This has brought back a lot of bad memories for you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I can't stop obsessing about it. It's making me crazy. A few months ago, there was a paroled child-molester in Santa Rosa. He hanged himself when the local police enforced Megan's Law and notified his neighbors that he was a convicted sex offender. I saw a picture of him on the evening news; he was a fat, bald, middle-aged man. He looked like a big, hairy marshmallow. I felt sorry for him--I could understand how trapped he must have felt. That's sick, isn't it? I'm commiserating with a convicted child-molester. I should be feeling for the kids he abused.", "input": "", "output": "You can feel empathy for people without condoning what they do. You may feel compassion for that man, but that doesn't make you a pedophile."}, {"instruction": "I know, I just...I'm not thinking straight. I needed to hear you say that. I need constant reassurance that I'm not a sickie. I'm edgy and paranoid all the time. I used to like to observe children at the mall or supermarket. I never talked to them or approached them, but I thought they were cute. I got a kick out of seeing them waddle around and get into trouble. Now, I feel like I can't even look at them any more. I feel sick to my stomach even telling you this. I probably sound like a closeted pedophile.", "input": "", "output": "No, Sharon, you don't. You've never expressed sexual attraction for children. In fact, you rarely talked about them until now. True, you've engaged in some rather unconventional sexual acts, but those were always with consenting adults. I don't believe you fit the profile of a sexual predator. The feelings you are expressing--paranoia, self-loathing--they are all brought on by this case. Your current aversion towards children--or rather an appearance of anything suggesting that you might be a child molester--is understandable."}, {"instruction": "I used to want to have kids. I don't anymore. I can imagine what a terrible mother I'd be. After living down the hall from the Pigs for a year, I decided there were too many fucked-up people procreating in this world, and I don't want to add to the problem. The Pigs are a textbook example of why some people shouldn't be allowed to reproduce. They were walking arguments for government-subsidized abortion and sterilization.", "input": "", "output": "What other feelings and memories has this case brought up for you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, do you know my reawakened sexual interest? Well, it's withered away. I thought I was getting back to normal--I was being sexually active and enjoying it. I felt like a whole person again, even with my gimpy leg. I should have known it was too good to last. I can't even masturbate, it's too disgusting. I felt so putrid and gross, telling Fielding about my sordid past. He probably thinks of me as some used-up old whore. Tony's going to have to go elsewhere to get his rocks off.", "input": "", "output": "Have you talked to Tony about this?"}, {"instruction": "He'll figure it out. Besides, he has all his fag friends to keep him company. Tony only went out with me to make Sick Fuck jealous. Now, Tony'll be able to appease Sick Fuck by becoming his full-time butt boy. I bet Tony will even lick Sick Fuck clean after he takes a dump to conserve toilet paper.", "input": "", "output": "A month ago, you expressed sympathy and concern for Tony. You even forgave him for withholding his HIV status from you. Now, it sounds like you want to cut off contact with him without even an explanation."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, so?", "input": "", "output": "That's rather harsh, Sharon. What emotional impact do you think this will have on Tony?"}, {"instruction": "Whose side are you on?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not taking sides..."}, {"instruction": "I'm the one that's in a world of shit. I don't need a pushy bottom bi-boy on my ass. He'll find someone else. And if he doesn't, he can rely on your venerated profession for solace.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Don't look so disapproving. I'm drumming up extra business for you guys.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, I can understand your anger, and I can see how this case can diminish your sexual interest. But taking it out on Tony is not right."}, {"instruction": "I can't control it. I'm angry all the time at myself, at the Pigs, at the whole fucking world. The Pigs deserve slow and painful deaths. They should kill themselves and spare their children the horror of having them as parents.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know when their case will go to trial?"}, {"instruction": "It could be a couple of months. Fielding said these things drag out for a long time. I'm relieved--I don't want to have to think about it for a while.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How are things at home?"}, {"instruction": "Rob asked Charlotte to paint the bathroom--he even paid her for doing it! He's given her nearly sixty thousand dollars already as part of their settlement, and now he fucking pays her for desecrating our bathroom. He complains bitterly whenever she comes over. He hates it when she even calls him; it puts him in a foul mood for the rest of the evening. But the bathroom needs painting, according to the High Priestess of Wall Treatments, also known as the raging cunt breed sow. Rob didn't want to do it himself because of his hand.", "input": "", "output": "Has Rob seen a doctor about his hand?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Rob went to a hand specialist a few weeks ago. They took an x-ray and couldn't find anything. They said it might be arthritis. Rob got a prescription for muscle relaxants, but it's not doing much good. He keeps dropping things.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Does Rob work at a computer terminal?"}, {"instruction": "No, he's a proud Luddite. Rob might use a computer at school for administrative stuff, but that's only because he has to. He's still in the stone-age--he uses an old, manual typewriter. It's not carpal tunnel syndrome, if that's what you're thinking. He bitches and whines about his hand more than I ever did with all the broken bones in my body. Men are such babies.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You should see what Charlotte did to the bathroom, it's beyond hideous. She found this article in the Martha Stewart rag describing how to texture wall surfaces. I don't know what's so objectionable about a plain white wall. Charlotte tried--tried is the operative word here--to create a faux-marble effect, using sponges and this marble pattern from the magazine. It was one of the most revolting things I'd ever seen. It was in this putrid orangy-pink color like rancid Peptol-Bismol. She painted on these wriggly lines--they were supposed to be the veins in the marble--with silver metallic paint. I think what I did was a great improvement, but Rob doesn't share my vision.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I thought of it as a Keith Haring tribute with an obscene twist. After Charlotte left, I used some old black paint and drew stick figures of a man fucking a hippopotamus and wavy lines around them to indicate ecstasy and intense thrusting. It was supposed to be of Rob and Charlotte, but I don't think the hippo was fat enough. I wanted to paint a metaphorical image of their marriage, but the only accurate representation would have been of a hippo attacking a man and then sitting on him, taking his wallet and gleefully running up all his credit cards. I wasn't sure how to portray that--the bathroom is so small, and I thought it would be too didactic and lack the primitive minimalism I was going for.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I felt rejuvenated afterward. The first layer of paint was still wet, so the orange and pink swirls mixed in with the black paint. I thought it looked really cool. My mind was reeling when I was done, but maybe that was just from inhaling paint fumes. I added some graffiti, too, to give it that New York subway look. I was in the midst of scrawling, \"Martha Stewart Sucks Big Donkey Dicks For Breakfast,\" when Rob walked in. He was upset when he saw it.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not surprised."}, {"instruction": "He had to use several thick coats of white, high-gloss paint to cover up the black. We ended up with a plain white wall, which was what we originally had. It was all very Zen. I told him he had great potential as a monochromatic minimalist.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Rob complained constantly about how much it hurt to paint with his bad hand. That was actually very satisfying--he didn't do much to help me when I first broke my foot.", "input": "", "output": "I find it interesting that you enjoyed the act of painting."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry, I'm not going get artsy-fartsy on you. I've stopped shaving my armpits, though. Maybe that's a bad omen.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, your recent circumstances would be stressful and difficult for anyone. A creative outlet like painting would be an effective way to express your feelings and discharge your negative emotions. I would recommend, however, that you confine your creative expressions to paper."}, {"instruction": "Damn. I was going to follow you home and tag the side of your house.", "input": "", "output": "Very funny. Give it a try, okay? Take a blank sheet of paper and paint, write, or draw something the next time you feel a need to express your feelings."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Sharon. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Have you been talking to Rob?", "input": "", "output": "I don't discuss your sessions with anyone, you know that."}, {"instruction": "Because it seems you've convinced Rob of your theory--I need a diversion to keep me out of trouble. When I told him I decided against taking any courses, he enrolled me in a class and volunteered me for an ESL program. ESL stands for English as a Second Language or Extremely Slow Learner, depending on whom you ask. I got stuck tutoring all the dumb ones, the ones who got low scores on the Tofu Test.", "input": "", "output": "You mean the TOEFL test?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, what I said. I get to tutor Tofu rejects for the rest of the year. The class he signed me up for produces the Shitty College Literary Magazine. And when I'm not spoon-feeding brain-dead immigrant teenagers, I'll be slogging through bad poetry written by lovesick, adolescent girls. It's a fate worse than death. I want to slit my throat right now just thinking about it.", "input": "", "output": "It's not so bad."}, {"instruction": "It's even worse. I might throttle a slow-learning student in frustration. Also, it's not a good idea--if the State Disability people find out I'm doing something that resembles work, they'll cut off my disability checks.", "input": "", "output": "That's not very likely."}, {"instruction": "They send out spies to check if you're really disabled. A lot of people get in trouble for falsely claiming disability. They say they have a bad back, and then someone catches them lifting weights or doing construction work. I saw it on \"Hard Copy.\"", "input": "", "output": "That's always a good source of information. You won't be doing strenuous physical labor, and it will only be for a few hours a week. I think you can manage tutoring a few students and a little proofreading. You might be able to do a lot of it at home."}, {"instruction": "Rob said the same thing. You're both in a conspiracy against me.", "input": "", "output": "You haven't even given it a try."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I have. The class started on Monday. I hate it already.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you're giving it a fair chance."}, {"instruction": "To be honest, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Our teacher, Doris, is the sort of old woman who scares small children with her wild hair and long green fingernails. When one of the students commented on her nails, Doris explained that all her life she bit her nails until she had to get false teeth. And for dramatic effect, she popped out her teeth. She looks like she might have a broomstick stashed in the big purse she always carries. She lives in Berkeley, of course, in run-down old house with about twenty cats. We got into an argument the first day.", "input": "", "output": "I'm almost afraid to ask, but what did you argue about?"}, {"instruction": "Doris doesn't come to class with a lesson plan and lecture, she rambles and goes off on tangents. She got on the subject of her favorite writers and started waxing romantic about Herb Caen, the San Francisco columnist who died last year. I said that Herb Caen was nothing more than a glorified gossip columnist and that stringing together a page-long series of elliptical phrases did not constitute actual writing. She shot back, \"Herb Caen is a vital part of this city's history. He's an institution!\" I told her he should have been put in one for his shameless pandering to the city's moneyed elite. His real gift was for high society ass-kissing: his knee pads got more use than Monica Lewinsky's. Stanton Delaplane was a hell of a better writer, and they didn't name a fucking street after him when he died.", "input": "", "output": "How did Doris react?"}, {"instruction": "I was hoping she would order me out of her classroom, but she was more amused than annoyed. We bantered back and forth, and she even agreed with me about Delaplane. No one else participated much. There were twelve students in the class, and they may as well have been comatose. I don't usually participate in class discussions, but I was so over-caffienated I thought, \"What the hell?\"", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk to any of the other students?"}, {"instruction": "Not directly. Doris went around the room and asked who our favorite writers were. This big goon, in head-to-toe goth regalia, said he loved Anne Rice. I said that she was a self-indulgent hack who had become a bad parody of herself, and \"The Mummy\" was an embarrassing piece of shit, but the \"Sleeping Beauty\" series couldn't be beat for one-handed reading.", "input": "", "output": "How did your classmates react?"}, {"instruction": "Goth Spice was pissed--those vampire wanna-bes are so sensitive. An androgynous-looking Japanese girl kind of smiled. This woman with a big ass and a face like Herman Munster's asked what I meant by one-handed reading. I said, \"A jack-off book,\" and she turned red. These two guys who sat together in the back, Beavis and Butthead, started hooting. A frizzy-haired woman sipping a Big Gulp had a disapproving look on her face.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What did you say when it was your turn?"}, {"instruction": "I said my favorite writer was the guy who writes \"Dilbert.\" I had a feeling they wouldn't know the name Scott Adams--they weren't a very literate group. There were a lot of Anne Rice and Stephen King fans.

The sight of a homely middle-aged woman in painted-on jeans showing cleavage made me think \"desperate\" and \"skanky.\" As she was leaving, Beavis nudged Butthead and said, \"Check out Camel Toe,\" because her jeans were so tight you could see all her anatomy, you know, the outline of her...", "input": "", "output": "I get the picture."}, {"instruction": "Well, anyway, I hope I don't end up like that. When the class reconvened, Doris continued with her poll. Camel Toe was a Danielle Steele fan--what a shocker. The boyish-looking Japanese girl--I'll call her L'il Dyke--said that she'd been reading women writers. Beavis turned to Butthead and mouthed \"lesbian,\" and they snorted and laughed. L'il Dyke didn't respond, but I could see her jaw tighten. She was sitting a few desks away from me. I leaned in her direction and whispered, \"You just know those guys have to be closet cases. They should change their names from Beavis and Butthead to Fuggin' Kweer and Fat Faggot.\" She laughed a little, which made me feel good.", "input": "", "output": "Isn't that a departure for you? In previous sessions, you've said that you find social situations difficult, but in this class you seem to have no problem expressing yourself and talking to strangers."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I noticed that, too.

I was secretly hoping that I would be expelled, but my plan backfired.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "At the end of class, Doris asked me if I knew any desktop publishing programs, and I was stupid enough to reply that I had experience with Pagemaker and Quark Xpress. With an evil grin on her face, she appointed me editor of the Shitty Rag. She proclaimed that I was astute, very perceptive, and a good critic. Maybe she did it to punish me for being so mouthy. I was surprised, and so was Big Gulp--her jaw dropped. I have a feeling she wanted the title of editor; she was so pompous and arrogant. I can't wait to see what she turns in next week.", "input": "", "output": "What's your assignment for next week?"}, {"instruction": "We have to bring in a poem, an essay, or a short story. Doris said she wanted all of us to be published in the Shitty Rag. I thought the class would consist of desktop publishing and proofreading, but we have to write, too. Doris said she had some contributions from the previous semester, but not enough to fill all the pages.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Have you started on your assignment yet?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't know what to write. Rob used to write poetry. Maybe I'll plagiarize one of his old poems.", "input": "", "output": "Why not give yourself a chance?"}, {"instruction": "Rob's the writer, I was very impressed when I read his poetry. I could never write as well as he does. He's even been published in some local anthologies. That's how he wooed Charlotte; they were both in college and working at the same restaurant. He was a cook, and she was a waitress. He won her over by writing her love poems on napkins and paper bags. Isn't that corny? I'll admit, I was jealous when he told me that. He doesn't write any more, and even if he did, he'd never write poems for me.", "input": "", "output": "You can't be sure of that. Don't compare yourself to others, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment. You don't necessarily have to write poetry. You've expressed some strong opinions here, why not put your rants on paper?"}, {"instruction": "That's an idea.", "input": "", "output": "If you don't like the results, you can always write something else."}, {"instruction": "I'm ambivalent about doing anything even remotely artistic. I don't want to become some pretentious, self-important, artsy-fartsy type.

He made a big show of being a suffering artist by wearing black clothes and boots even on the hottest summer days. He wouldn't deign to let me read any of his unpublished novels because \"they weren't ready.\" What he really meant was that he didn't think I was smart enough to understand all the deep symbolism and shit. His work was rejected by several publishers, but he kept plugging away, churning out reams of drivel. I hope he never becomes a best-selling author, because that would make me very depressed.", "input": "", "output": "You don't have to emulate these people to explore your creative side."}, {"instruction": "It comes with the territory.", "input": "", "output": "Not necessarily.

I'll bring a 400-page treatise on daytime television, then you'll be sorry.", "input": "", "output": "No, I won't. Take care, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Not so bad, I guess. I've made my feeble attempt at a short story.", "input": "", "output": "Your classroom assignment?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I was afraid we would have to read them aloud, but Doris got off on a tangent and spent the class talking about the theater. A troupe is putting on a production of \"Troilus and Cressida,\" a Shakespeare play I hadn't even heard of.

Graying temples don't give you any points towards coolness.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I think I had a breakthrough, of sorts.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I've never really understood the dynamic among women. I don't have many women friends, at least not for very long. When I was chatting up Li'l Dyke, I sensed she was withdrawing from me. I didn't know why; I thought I was being nice instead of my usual surly self. Maybe she knew I was a big phony. She was carrying an instrument case, and I asked if she played the violin. She smirked and said, \"Duh.\"", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I thought I had nothing to lose, so I tried a different tack. I said that the Shitty College orchestra was known for its mediocrity. She sniffed and informed me that she was a student at the San Francisco Music Conservatory. She was only taking this class because she wanted a change of pace. I told her that most classically trained musicians where little more than machines and that music conservatories were like factories, cranking out these machines by the dozen. That got her attention. I challenged her; I asked to hear her play. Li'l Dyke rolled her eyes and made a face. But after class, we went to a practice room at the conservatory.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And she played a piece by Vaughn Williams, the Skylark Concerto. I admit, I was impressed--it's a difficult piece. But I knew I wouldn't win her over by praising her, so I told her that she used too much rosin and needed to work on her vibrato. I said that she didn't have the maturity or depth to interpret the piece and that she played like yet another classically-trained automaton.", "input": "", "output": "How did she respond?"}, {"instruction": "She was annoyed. I added that if she ever wanted to become a soloist, she'd have to use the Midori Ito public relations ploy and play up her flat-chested, androgynous sexuality, and hope the latent pedophiles would buy tickets in droves. That pissed her off; she told me to shut up.", "input": "", "output": "That was very harsh criticism, Sharon. Did you know what you were talking about? The piece you're referring to isn't a concerto, it's a tone poem called The Lark Ascending. And that last comment was really uncalled for. You know from personal experience that girls that age are extremely self-conscious about their looks."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, whatever. My parents forced me to take piano for years, but I wasn't very good. Most of what I know about classical music I learned from listening to KDFC 102.1 FM.", "input": "", "output": "Last week, you came to this girl's defense when a guy in your class called her names.

When I complimented her in class, she barely acknowledged me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "She asked me the same thing: what the hell did I know about music? I know the difference between a mature, seasoned performer and a student who practices a lot. I picked out a few notes from the piece she played on the piano in the room. I hit a lot of clinkers even when she slammed down the sheet music in front of me. She snorted and said, \"Very good, I can tell you've been playing for years.\" But at least now, she was talking to me. I pointed out where the apex of the musical phrase was, and then I had to explain what \"apex\" meant. I showed her, with my clumsy keyboarding skills, how she could use volume and tempo to emphasize the notes at the peak of the phrase. Li'l Dyke was defensive, standing with her arms folded across her chest, but I think I made my point. I told her I had a great book about music interpretation by Pablo Casals, and she could give me a call and borrow it sometime.

A few of them I could barely understand, their accents were so thick. I can understand why a non-native speaker would have trouble with English spelling and grammar. Granted, English isn't an easy language, and American idioms can be confusing. But the Tofu Rejects I saw could barely string five words together to make a sentence, and they're high school graduates!

My mother struggled for years to learn English, she didn't start speaking it until she was over thirty. My mother wasn't very educated to begin with, even in her own language. She came from a rural area, and in her generation, farm families didn't send their daughters to school. She worked really hard, going to night school for years to learn English and take citizenship classes. My mother is not very Americanized. She's still hard to understand, and she's a lousy driver, but at least she tried.

Sometimes, I take a break and do some deep breathing. What pisses me off is that so many teens from immigrant families don't even need to assimilate. They live in self-segregation. Everyone in their neighborhoods comes from the same or a similar culture as they do. They choose to associate only with people from their homeland. And a lot of them were really arrogant--I could tell they thought English classes were a waste of time. This one fat Korean boy, an accounting major, didn't even pretend to care. He kept saying, \"This is hard for me.\" He knew as a CPA he'd earn a better living than any English major by cooking the books of a Korean-owned business.

So she called you after all?"}, {"instruction": "No, she didn't call, but she talked to me after class. She got that book I told her about, she found it at the conservatory library. After class, we went to a bar in Bernal Heights called Wild Side West. It's one of the oldest lesbian bars in the city. Bernal Heights is an enclave for gay yuppies. I wasn't sure if Lila was actually a dyke or if she just looked like one--a lot of young girls wear boys clothes. Lila looks so young, she could pass for a grade-school tomboy.

I didn't get it at first.", "input": "", "output": "Get what?"}, {"instruction": "She wasn't there to be with me, she was there hoping to meet someone else. She was looking around the room; she barely spoke to me. She caught the eye of this tall athletic-looking woman with short, blonde hair. They were flirting and laughing just a few seats away from me.

She made sure I saw her. And then she picked the most attractive woman there to charm, and she succeeded. She was doing it to fuck with me, the same way I fucked with her the week before.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I didn't realize until now that you had more than a platonic interest in this girl."}, {"instruction": "Well, it would have been okay if she wanted to be buddies. I was kind of attracted to her, but not physically. Skinny doesn't do it for me. I don't want to fuck a girl with legs like sticks, jutting hip bones, and no tits. I was attracted to her as a person. I liked her look, too: the short purple hair, baggy clothes, and an instrument case. Even the lesbian posturing was endearing. I guess I was attracted to her because she seemed elusive and rare. She was different in an undefinable way. I thought she was an innocent, too. But the way she acted at Wild Side West that night, I realized she had more experience than I thought.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, I got sick of watching her ignore me and got up and left.

I went home instead.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you didn't act on your impulses."}, {"instruction": "I didn't a chance--those dykes would have beat the shit out of me, even if I was in a cast.

Last week, I thought I'd cracked the code: I learned how to beat her at her own game by being a bitch. Now I'm wondering if that was the wrong strategy. I'm so clueless. I feel like such an idiot.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been involved with women sexually before?"}, {"instruction": "I've had sex with a few women. Most of them were just into mind-fucking. Now that being a dyke is considered cool, there are a lot of poseurs out there. In fact, it's really common in the gay and lesbian community. I've had this sort of thing happen to me before, and I've heard of it happening to other people. Maybe it's my own fault for wanting something I couldn't have.", "input": "", "output": "Did you see Lila as some sort of conquest?"}, {"instruction": "Conquest? That's an interesting way of putting it. Maybe I did. I thought we had something in common: we're both Japanese, but not really traditional; she had a background in classical music; and we were both in that class. As I'm listening to myself say this, it doesn't make a lot of sense. It was a stupid idea. I wish I could wear a bag over my head at the next class without drawing undue attention to myself.

There's no reason why you have to shoulder all of the burden yourself."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I can ask her. I'm not sure that she'd be willing to strong-arm anyone into helping me.

We also posted notices around campus, asking students to turn in writing and artwork. You should see what they've turned in so far. Some of the poems were plagiarized word-for-word. I even recognized an old top-forty hit from Air Supply. Actually, that was kind of funny. The stories and essays are so bad they're almost unreadable. I'm really starting to dread this. At first, it was kind of exciting, and I thought it would be a good experience--desktop publishing can come in handy. What if the Shitty Rag lives up to its name? I don't want to be associated with an anthology of dreck.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "That incident with Lila made me think of something that I'd put out of my mind. I went out with...well, actually, I just fucked this guy who worked in the same building as I did. He was a self-involved egomaniac, a real prick. And of course I had the hots for him, because he treated me like shit. He stood me up, criticized my weight and my appearance, even made fun of the way I talked. I was pathetic. When he wouldn't return my calls, I practically begged him to see me again. He told me that he had an image of the perfect complement to him, and it wasn't me. What he really wanted was a Stepford wife--someone he could take to the company picnic and who would make a good impression on the people he worked with. He wanted a thin, social, vapid Barbie doll who knew how to play the game. To him, I was just a loser who couldn't play the game. That was almost ten years ago. And here I am now. I'm still a loser who doesn't know how to play.", "input": "", "output": "But do you really want to play this game?"}, {"instruction": "I used to think that I didn't, that I was above that. I wouldn't have been content being a trophy wife to a work-obsessed corporate cretin, even if he did have a good income. I found ways to occupy myself that didn't bring me into contact with too many people. I really like the fact that Rob is socially isolated, too. We stay home most nights and watch television. I convinced myself that this is what I really want. This is the life that I'm best suited to.", "input": "", "output": "Are you reassessing that judgment now?"}, {"instruction": "What I found so alluring about Lila was that she represented something I thought I'd left behind. The women I chased before--the ones I couldn't have--I dismissed as being beneath me. They didn't have my interests or share my values. Some of them I could hardly stand to talk to for more than a few minutes.

If a man had done that, I would have dismissed him as yet another asshole. With a woman, it seems like a personal betrayal. I spent all night fuming about it. I was enraged, and I was almost in tears as I waited for my bus outside the Big Heart Cafe. When it finally arrived, I wanted to throw myself in front of it. When I got in bed with Rob, he rolled toward me and put his arms around me. I usually hate it when he does that because he generates so much body heat. He's always warm and sweaty. But that night, it felt good, kind of. I could feel myself wanting to cry. I held my breath and willed myself not to. Rob asked if I was okay. I said, \"Yeah,\" and he went back to sleep.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell Rob what happened?"}, {"instruction": "No. He and Charlotte had a don't ask, don't tell policy. He probably suspects something, but wants to be spared the gory details.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel talking about this now?"}, {"instruction": "I feel like the world's biggest loser. I should always wear a t-shirt with \"welcome\" written across it. I act like a fucking door mat.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to talk anymore. Our time's up.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure you're all right, Sharon?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I'll wallow in self-pity for a while and take a nap. Then I'll be fine.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Sharon. You can call me. If I'm not here, my answering service will contact me."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "It was...hmm, I guess it was interesting. I ran into Lila again.", "input": "", "output": "In your class?"}, {"instruction": "No, actually, I cut a class to avoid her. I met with Doris later to get the assignments.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So how did you happen to bump into Lila?"}, {"instruction": "It's that horrible tutoring program. Lila is an ESL student, and her Tofu test score wasn't very good. I'm not sure why that matters, because she's a music major. I'll bet her parents are pushing her; they want a well-rounded overachiever for a daughter.", "input": "", "output": "Lila is Japanese, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I thought she was born in the states, but it turns out she's an \"Iisei\"--a first generation immigrant like me. Or is it \"Nisei?\" I always forget. I'm not sure if I can be Iisei or Nisei, because I'm just a half-breed, and I don't really count anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Did you notice Lila's English was limited before?"}, {"instruction": "It's hard to tell, she doesn't say much. She has a slight accent, but that's not so unusual when you live in a non-English speaking household. I wonder if she spent most of her school years practicing or learning music theory instead of taking regular courses. Lila's mother called me over the weekend. She said she got my number from the school and asked if I would tutor her daughter. I didn't realize who it was--Lila's mother sounded like a nice Japanese lady with a pronounced accent. She seemed very eager to have me; she said that it was difficult to find a decent tutor on short notice, and that I had been well-recommended. Go figure.", "input": "", "output": "When did you realize you were going to be tutoring Lila?"}, {"instruction": "When I got the address. Lila's mom wanted me to go to their house--typical rich bitch. She couldn't have Lila meet me halfway at a library. Lila looked surprised when she opened the door. She was just as rude as ever. She didn't even offer me a glass of water or ask me to sit down.", "input": "", "output": "How did that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I wasn't sure if it was deliberate, but I sensed that it was. It bugged me a lot. Japanese parents usually beat good manners into their children, especially girls. But then again, Lila's mom was snotty when I first saw her. Maybe they thought I was beneath them, like a servant.", "input": "", "output": "Were Lila's parents home when you came over?"}, {"instruction": "No, she was all by herself. Their house looked like a place where no one really lives. They had white carpeting and white furniture. Everything looked pristine and untouched. Lila didn't even invite me in, she just stood there with a blank look on her face. I suggested that we sit at the kitchen counter, and she followed me.", "input": "", "output": "So were you supposed to help her with her homework?"}, {"instruction": "I tried to. I went over some Tofu test practice drills. I may as well have been singing in Arabic, she barely responded. I moved on to the material for her English class. Lila's mother had told me she was several weeks behind. I also knew Lila hadn't turned in any assignments in Doris' class.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I asked Lila what she had read so far, and she shrugged. I couldn't figure out if she was feeling shy and self-conscious about our previous encounter, or if she was giving me the cold shoulder. I tried being nice, being an understanding tutor. I even excused myself to the bathroom to do that deep-breathing/visualizing thing.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that, Sharon. Were you getting angry?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. After about twenty minutes of her shrugs and \"I don't knows,\" I was ready to slap her. I tried to cool down--that's when I went to the bathroom. When I got back, I tried different techniques. Some ESL students like to read aloud, so I can help them with words and idiomatic expressions. But that didn't work with Lila--she wasn't even willing to try. It's the Tofu rejects who don't even try that piss me off the most. I hate it when they want me to spoon-feed the answers and do the work for them. I don't know why I even bother; most of them don't care.", "input": "", "output": "How did you react to Lila's indifferent response?"}, {"instruction": "I told Lila I couldn't help her if she didn't meet me halfway. She didn't say anything at first, then she touched my arm and asked coyly, \"Can we do something else?\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I was furious. She'd wasted enough time already. My first impulse was to walk out. Maybe I should have.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I had a sudden inspiration, a way to motivate her. I asked her to sit on my lap, and she did. I put my arms around her and made out with her a little. She still wouldn't kiss me; I wondered if I had bad breath. I took off her shirt. She balked at removing her jeans, so I pinched her nipples and bottom. She seemed to like that--she got up and took off her jeans, making a big show out of wiggling out of them.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Sharon..."}, {"instruction": "When she climbed naked into my lap again, I teased her with my hand, the way she liked. While I rubbed her, I said that I had ways of making her study. She said, \"You can't make me,\" and I had to rise to the challenge.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon! You were her tutor. That was completely inappropriate..."}, {"instruction": "I taunted her with slaps and titty-twisters, and got her to squeal a few times. Then I made her read from her text while I rubbed her clit. When she slowed down or stumbled over a word, I would stop.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, what you did was very inappropriate."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I let her continue reading. When she stopped or stumbled, I hit the back of her head with my hand, lightly at first, then harder. When my hand started to hurt, I pushed her off my lap and told her to keep reading. I got a wooden spoon from the kitchen and used that instead.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon!"}, {"instruction": "After a few good whacks, she was crying. I ordered her to read while she sobbed, I made her answer the questions at the end of the section.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon! What were you thinking..."}, {"instruction": "I had a strange feeling as this was happening. I felt detached and empty. I was also excited, but not really sexually--it was more the feeling of getting away with doing something bad, like stealing a piece of candy.", "input": "", "output": "I can't believe you did this, Sharon. Aside from the fact that this was outrageously wrong, do you realize what can happen to you if Lila tells her mother?"}, {"instruction": "I know she won't. I had a Japanese mother, too; this is not the sort of thing you tell them. At one point, she did threaten to tell on me. I bluffed, I said her mother had given me permission to hit her and if she ran crying to mommy, she was going to get it from one or both of her parents. She shut up after that. Besides, I don't think her mother would have minded too much. Japanese families believe in corporal punishment. I'm sure Lila got worse from her parents, particularly since she was a music student--they get the shit beaten out of them; that's how they learn to play so well.", "input": "", "output": "This doesn't excuse what you did. What you did was abuse, Sharon. Lila may have been insensitive and rude to you, but that it no way justifies non consensual S&M play as a form of revenge. And during a tutoring session..."}, {"instruction": "She gave her consent when she sat on my lap.", "input": "", "output": "That hardly constitutes consent to being beaten. As I recall, you had some unsavory experiences in the S&M Community, where you felt pressured into doing things you didn't want. Have you forgotten that?"}, {"instruction": "No, but it comes with the territory. If you don't want to get hit by a car, don't play in the street. If Lila's going to play mind games, she's going to get fucked over in return. A man would not have been as understanding and compassionate as I was.", "input": "", "output": "Do you consider what you did understanding and compassionate?"}, {"instruction": "Submissives and masochists can take more pain when they're sexually aroused. That's the way it is for me. I made sure she was sexually excited before I hit her. Besides, I stopped after she cried a little.", "input": "", "output": "I hope for your sake Lila doesn't tell her parents or a school official. You could face criminal charges for this, Sharon. And that's in addition to the ones you're already facing for drug manufacturing."}, {"instruction": "She won't say anything. She's learned to keep it all inside, just like me. We're cut from similar cloth. I think it was therapeutic for me.", "input": "", "output": "Therapeutic? How so?"}, {"instruction": "While I was watching her sitting there, sobbing, I thought this is what parents must feel like when they beat their kids. I felt powerful and angry. And at the same time it made me cringe--I knew how frightened and humiliated she was. It made me think of the way my mother and her friends used to compare notes on whether to use a paddle, a shoe, or a belt. They used to have these bragging sessions about whose discipline was harsher and more frequent. I've long suspected that parents who use corporal punishment enjoy inflicting it on some level. They probably have latent S&M tendencies that they don't realize.", "input": "", "output": "You had that epiphany at Lila's expense?"}, {"instruction": "Fuck her. If that little shit hadn't disrespected me, I wouldn't have done it.", "input": "", "output": "That's no excuse. Lila is a teenager, in many ways still a child."}, {"instruction": "She's old enough to want sex and to manipulate people to get it.", "input": "", "output": "Do you regret what you did?"}, {"instruction": "It turned me on, and turned my stomach at the same time. It was actually kind of...hmm, empowering? I felt like it completed me somehow, like the cycle of abuse had come full circle.", "input": "", "output": "You feel absolutely no remorse? You don't feel for Lila as the victim?"}, {"instruction": "I think I might have opened a new window into her sexual psyche.", "input": "", "output": "Or caused a serious trauma."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she'll be on your couch in a year or two. Do I get a kickback?", "input": "", "output": "That's not funny, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "You're taking this too seriously. Do you want to hear how it ends?", "input": "", "output": "I have a feeling I'm going to."}, {"instruction": "After she finished the chapter, I marched her upstairs to her bedroom. I took belts from her closet and used them to tie her spread-eagled to the bed. I was going to sit on her face and make her lick me until I got off, but I wasn't really into it. I watched her cry for a while, then I left.", "input": "", "output": "You left her tied to the bed?"}, {"instruction": "I loosened the belt around her right wrist, so she could release it herself if she tried hard enough.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon! Her parents could have found her in that condition..."}, {"instruction": "Then they won't ask me to tutor their daughter anymore.", "input": "", "output": "No, they will press assault charges instead."}, {"instruction": "I don't think Lila will tell anyone. And she won't fuck with me again, either.", "input": "", "output": "You took an enormous risk, Sharon. And..."}, {"instruction": "It was worth it just to see her squirm.", "input": "", "output": "Did you enjoy what you did?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, it gave me a certain sick satisfaction, especially after the way she treated me.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you're not planning on doing this again."}, {"instruction": "Not right away. I'm savoring the afterglow. I felt a kind of a mix of shock, remorse, and excitement for a few days afterward. I even got off on the fear of getting caught. It was interesting telling you about it and bringing up those feelings all over again.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I don't know what to say, Sharon. What you did was very wrong. It was emotionally damaging to you and to Lila. And it's criminal. Perhaps you won't get caught this time, but next time..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, okay.", "input": "", "output": "It was not okay, Sharon. And the fact that you enjoyed..."}, {"instruction": "Look, it's enough. I think I'm really clear now on how you feel.", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "I'll try not to sexually molest any more underage girls before our next session. How's that?", "input": "", "output": "All right, Sharon. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Mmm.", "input": "", "output": "What happened? Did you just come from the dentist?"}, {"instruction": "Uh!", "input": "", "output": "Oh god! You pierced your tongue?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, please keep your pants on..."}, {"instruction": "Hmm?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I see. You had your labia pierced, too. How delightful."}, {"instruction": "Hmm, uh?", "input": "", "output": "How do you plan to communicate during our session? Oh, I see, you brought your laptop."}, {"instruction": "I'm a pretty fast typist.", "input": "", "output": "I can see that."}, {"instruction": "Or would you rather I express myself through an interpretive dance?", "input": "", "output": "The laptop will suffice."}, {"instruction": "It's not as nice as yours. I only use mine for text files. I've been keeping a journal in it, too. I got out of tutoring the Tofu Rejects this week, but I still had to go to class.", "input": "", "output": "When did you get the piercings?"}, {"instruction": "Over the weekend, at Black and Blue Tattoo.", "input": "", "output": "Wasn't it painful?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah! I screamed my head off. The waiting room was full when I first arrived, but after I was done, everyone had cleared out. The pain was really exciting. I got an incredible endorphin rush that lasted for days afterward. Now I understand why some people get every part of themselves pierced.", "input": "", "output": "Are you planning on doing that?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no...well, not until these piercings heal, anyway. That refreshing first piss of the day really hurts like a bitch now.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you're taking care of them, Sharon. Infection is a big risk. You should clean the genital piercing with rubbing alcohol."}, {"instruction": "You're supposed to use hydrogen peroxide. Rubbing alcohol just worsens the irritation. I rinse my mouth and twat with hydrogen peroxide a few times a day.", "input": "", "output": "I see. How long does it take to heal?"}, {"instruction": "A few months. It depends, and everyone is different. Attitude is an important part of healing. I'm looking forward to giving my first blow job with a stud in my tongue--it's supposed to enhance oral sex. Rob isn't so enthusiastic, though.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You look disgusted.", "input": "", "output": "I can't say I'm happy about this. Are there other body modifications you'd like to try?"}, {"instruction": "I always wanted a brand.", "input": "", "output": "A brand? Like they do to cattle?"}, {"instruction": "No, not a big, ugly cow-brand. I want a small brand, in a subtle, tasteful design.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'm kind of surprised I got the piercings. I always thought the piercing thing was a strange and aberrant practice. Most tattoos are crude and ugly, though sometimes, I notice one I like. I wonder what the next body-modification fad will be? Will teenagers go the tribal African route and wear rings round their necks to stretch them out like a giraffe's? Or maybe they'll put those big plates in their lips. Beauty standards are so bizarre. I wonder if other cultures look at skinny Calvin Klein models with bewilderment and shake their heads, muttering, \"Crazy Americans.\"", "input": "", "output": "How did Rob react to your body modifications?"}, {"instruction": "He's pissed. That's why I did it.", "input": "", "output": "You did this to make Rob angry?"}, {"instruction": "He told me to get out of the house last Sunday, so his Ex-cow could come pick up her things. It takes that goddamned Bovine all fucking day to pick up a few things for her pasture. Of course, the Heifer has to drop off several boxes of junk--she always leaves more than she takes. What does she think--our house is a storage facility? Why can't she drop off her junk at Goodwill or the city dump? Breed Sow even rearranged the fucking furniture. She hasn't lived there in ages, and she acts like she owns the place. I thought I'd get back at Rob for letting her walk all over him. He's expressed distaste for piercings, now he has to look at them all the time. I keep sticking out my tongue at him just to see the look on his face.", "input": "", "output": "Charlotte is still in the process of moving out her belongings?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, the Belle of Pigs is deliberately dragging it out for as long as possible. Charlotte always makes excuses to come back. She loves prolonging the agony. It's almost as if she gets off on emotional pain. And it looks like Breed Sow has been putting in some time at the trough. Rob thinks she's gained a lot of weight, too, at least fifty pounds. She always was a corpulent creature, but now she's monstrously obese. I've been writing down fat jokes so I'll be prepared when I see her.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "You know who's lost weight? Godzilla! I saw her at the BART station a few days ago. I barely recognized her. She had her stomach stapled, and it curbed her appetite. She didn't look very good, though. Her skin hangs in folds around her face. I can't call her Godzilla anymore, I'll have to come up with something else. I'm thinking of renaming her Sag Hag.", "input": "", "output": "Why not call her by her given name?"}, {"instruction": "It's more fun to rechristen them. People aren't as threatening if they have a funny moniker. I told Sag Hag she looked good, even though I thought she looked terrible. I liked her better when she was fat.", "input": "", "output": "As I recall, you gave her the nickname \"Godzilla\" because of her size. You used to say you were repulsed by her obesity. Now that she's lost weight, you complain she doesn't look good because of that."}, {"instruction": "Some people aren't meant to be thin. Like Oprah Winfrey--her face is really weird now. And her personality's changed--she's edgy and judgmental.", "input": "", "output": "Not warm and accepting like you."}, {"instruction": "Oh shut up. I saw that motivational diet-and-exercise book she co-wrote with her trainer. Anyone who has to go to such great lengths to stay slim should learn to accept her size.", "input": "", "output": "One of the reasons why people go to such great lengths to stay slim is to avoid the prejudice of a society biased against people who are overweight."}, {"instruction": "Society will always have unfair prejudices. Take a look at Paul Prudhomme, there's a picture of him in all of his corpulent grandeur on the cover of his cookbooks, but that doesn't dissuade people from trying his artery-clogging brand of cajun cuisine. When he talks lovingly of bacon grease and the joys of deep frying, you know his heart's not into low-fat cooking. You take a look at those pudgy cheeks, the rolls of fat around his neck, and that disarming smile, and you've got to love him, all six hundred pounds of him. He looks a lot better and happier now that he gained back the weight he lost.", "input": "", "output": "I understand your feelings, but obesity does bring with it a number of health problems."}, {"instruction": "I'd rather live life to the hilt, complete with heaping portions of fried chicken and Doritos. I'll die young and leave behind a fat, greasy corpse. They'll have to bury me in a piano crate.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Are things between you and Rob strained because of the holes you recently punched in yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Rob was angry at first. But because of his hand, he's come to depend on me. He has trouble holding a coffee cup now.", "input": "", "output": "His hand? Oh, that's right, the doctor said he had arthritis."}, {"instruction": "Rob's hand has gotten much worse. It's terribly swollen, all puffed out like a hamburger bun. He says it hurts, too, and he has very limited motion.", "input": "", "output": "That doesn't sound like arthritis. Has he thought of getting a second opinion?"}, {"instruction": "He will now, because he can't even wipe his ass. His boxers are full of holes, and he wears the same jeans everyday. I'm thinking of nicknaming him Gravy Stain.", "input": "", "output": "How sweet."}, {"instruction": "I've even offered to do it for him, I was so grossed-out by the skid marks. He wouldn't let me, even when I banged on the door mid-bowel-movement and told him I had special adult butt-wipes. Did you know Depends makes those? They package says they're designed especially for adults--they must use industrial-strength solvents.", "input": "", "output": "No, I wasn't aware that there was a brand of wipes designed for adults."}, {"instruction": "I was so disappointed when Rob wouldn't let me use the grown-up fanny wipes on him. He said he thought it would take the romance out of our relationship. I wanted to tell him I didn't think that was possible, but I didn't want him to take it the wrong way.", "input": "", "output": "How very sensitive of you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I can be warm and fuzzy, too, you know. It amazes me that butt stains come in such a wide variety of shapes and sizes. I can almost tell what kind of mood Rob is in by the marks on the seat of his pants. It's kind of like a very personal, very organic Rorsasch test. Or maybe it's closer to reading tea leaves. I haven't decided yet.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I wonder if it's possible to devise some sort of personality test based on butt stains. Just think what a powerful diagnostic tool that could be. We could work on it together, and you could implement it in your practice. It would be a revolutionary new technique, written up in the American Journal of Psychiatry. You'd be known as the Shit Stain Shrink. Can you say that three times fast?", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, is there something else you'd like to talk about today?"}, {"instruction": "I want to talk about butt stains.", "input": "", "output": "I think we should spend the session talking about issues that are important to you."}, {"instruction": "Butt stains are important to me. They're really hard to get out.", "input": "", "output": "I suspect your professed interest in this rather distasteful subject is an attempt to avoid talking about serious issues."}, {"instruction": "Butt stains are serious. Get a whiff of Rob these days--it's a pretty serious issue, let me tell you.", "input": "", "output": "Did Rob make a doctor's appointment to get a second opinion about his hand?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he has an appointment with another hand specialist on Friday. It's weird, all these problems started when Groucho bit him. But the last doctor he saw said he didn't think it was caused by the cat bite.", "input": "", "output": "If the swelling was caused by an animal bite, it might be a sign of infection. I'm wondering if Rob's condition could be alleviated by something as simple as antibiotics."}, {"instruction": "Infection, uh? I hadn't thought of that.", "input": "", "output": "That's one of several possibilities. That's something a specialist could look for."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. So what do you think of my butt-stain Rorsasch idea? I really think I'm onto something here.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon..."}, {"instruction": "I used to have this theory that you can predict a person's future based on what kind of Chicken McNugget they chose first.  Chicken McNuggets, you see, have distinct shapes. There are the elongated ones with little stumpy appendages, and there are round ones, and some are kind of in-between.", "input": "", "output": "Fascinating."}, {"instruction": "I like long ones the best. It's a phallic symbol, of course. I think this expresses my love of performing fellatio. Just my luck that I end up living with the one red-meat-eating heterosexual male on the planet who doesn't like blow jobs. Rob didn't like them even before I got my tongue pierced. It's unnatural, and unhealthy, and downright un-American, if you ask me, considering who we have in the White House.", "input": "", "output": "We're almost out of time, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "By my watch, we still have a few minutes left. Do you think my Chicken McNugget Rorsasch has any possibilities?", "input": "", "output": "Have a good week, Sharon. Take care of those piercings."}, {"instruction": "How about a personality test based on those pale, yellow, slug tracks women get on the crotches of their underwear? Vagina stain Rorsasch?

I think it's an idea with great potential.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I just got it a few days ago. It's removable, so now I have no excuse for not bathing.", "input": "", "output": "Good for you."}, {"instruction": "Not really. I was starting to enjoy stinking in my own juices. I could offend people without even trying.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I have a feeling I'm going to regret asking this, but what's in the plastic bag?"}, {"instruction": "It's all the dead skin I peeled of my foot. There's a lot of it, see?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I see."}, {"instruction": "It's really neat, huh? Right after they gave me the removable cast, I spent an hour picking off all the dead skin that accumulated. It was fascinating, like looking at the rings of a giant redwood. It came off really easily, too, like an orange peel.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "The amount of toe jam I've produced was also very impressive, but I didn't have a vial to put it in, so I can't show you.", "input": "", "output": "How unfortunate."}, {"instruction": "My right foot smells weird when I take of the cast. It smells different from my left foot.", "input": "", "output": "Do you spend a lot of time sniffing your feet?"}, {"instruction": "Everyone needs a hobby.

I'm not ready to go back to work.", "input": "", "output": "Did you enjoy your time off?"}, {"instruction": "I would have preferred time off with full mobility, but yeah, I did like sleeping until noon and goofing off all day. Rob can't get into it. I've tried to enlighten him on the joys of sloth and slovenliness, but he doesn't see the light. He insists on working, even though his doctor ordered him to take some time off.", "input": "", "output": "How is Rob doing? Is his hand better?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, the swelling diminished after the doctor prescribed tetracycline. You were right, it was an infection caused by the cat bite.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How is your foot? Are you in any pain?"}, {"instruction": "It aches when I do a lot of walking, but it's much better, unfortunately. My back hurts, though, probably from having my balance thrown off.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. You might try some exercises..."}, {"instruction": "I'm not in any condition to be running marathons right now.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't say you should run cross-country, but some moderate exercises would be beneficial. The muscles in your legs have probably atrophied from lack of use."}, {"instruction": "That's okay. The increased girth at my waistline more than makes up for it.", "input": "", "output": "The gained weight--especially around your midsection--will only exacerbate your back problems."}, {"instruction": "If you write me a prescription for Dexedrine, I'll be skinny as a rail in no time.", "input": "", "output": "You know I won't do that, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Damn. It was worth a try.", "input": "", "output": "Smoking marijuana also promotes weight gain. That's part of the rationale behind the Medical Marijuana movement--it stimulates appetite."}, {"instruction": "Don't I know it. Why is everything good has to be illegal, immoral, or fattening?", "input": "", "output": "You could ask your doctor to suggest some exercises to strengthen your legs and upper body."}, {"instruction": "No, he's with CalaCare HMO, he doesn't give a shit about my well-being.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "No offense to you, of course. You're actually pretty compassionate for an HMO shrink.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. As I was saying, moderate exercise can invigorate as well as strengthen. You might find your moods improving if you exercise regularly."}, {"instruction": "I have to stay cranky and irritable. I don't want to lose my edge.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been using the relaxation tape?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. I use it at night when I can't sleep.", "input": "", "output": "You might want to use the tape in the morning, when you first get up.

Why do you feel this way?"}, {"instruction": "Half the class has dropped out, and no one's contributing anything to the Shitty Rag.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been writing?"}, {"instruction": "I've been too busy slogging through reams of dreck.

Bye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sharon. Happy Thanksgiving. Oh, remember that we won't have a session next week, okay, but I'll see you on the following Friday?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. I look like I've got a pile of sauteed onions on my head.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "It's a performance-art piece, a work-in-progress. I'm thinking of calling it \"Self-Annihilation by Haircut.\" I tried to strip all the color out of my hair, but it didn't quite work the way I planned, and I ended up with two-tone hair. Then I tried to cut off all the dark parts. I didn't have a very sharp pair of scissors, and it came out kind of uneven.", "input": "", "output": "You know, Halloween was a month ago."}, {"instruction": "You need to work on your bedside manner, Doctor. You're looking at me like I'm a sideshow freak.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "No, it's okay. It does look weird. I should put a bone in my nose and get tattoos on my arms, then I'll look like a true San Francisco resident.", "input": "", "output": "What made you want to...uh, experiment with your hair?"}, {"instruction": "I wanted to change my hair color. I've been dyeing my hair since high school, that's when I started going gray. I've always used a dark brown dye. Lately, I've been getting a lot more gray coming in. I read that you're supposed to switch to a lighter hair color as you get older. The woman at the beauty supply store recommended this chemical preparation that strips permanent dye out of hair. She said that I had to get rid of the dark brown color before I could go lighter.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Have you tried this sort of thing before?"}, {"instruction": "No, I haven't, can't you tell?

Every time he looks at me, he furrows his brow as if he can't believe what he's seeing. Even the cat looks at me funny.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps you should see a professional hair stylist."}, {"instruction": "I can't afford that now. I need to have corrective work, and that costs a lot. Maybe I should buy a baseball cap instead.", "input": "", "output": "That's an idea."}, {"instruction": "The only advantage is that it's easier for me to wash my hair now--it's shorter.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you're focusing on the positive."}, {"instruction": "Stop looking at me that way.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Sharon. Would you like to talk about something else?"}, {"instruction": "Rob's ulcer is acting up.", "input": "", "output": "Rob has an ulcer?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he's always had stomach problems. He gave himself an ulcer so he could avoid being drafted during Vietnam--he went on an aspirin and water diet. Usually, he takes Zantac, and that takes care of it. But this past week, he's been moaning and kvetching--you'd think he was ready to die. Wouldn't you know it?  Just as his hand got better, his stomach got worse.", "input": "", "output": "Has he seen a doctor?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, they diagnosed him with peptic ulcer disease. His insurance didn't cover the prescription-strength Pepcid the Doctors gave him. It costs one hundred dollars a bottle! They also gave him something for pain and told him to eat only bland, soft foods for a few days.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Of course, Rob ate half a pizza the day after his appointment. He was moaning and clutching his side all night. He's doing penance now; he eats nothing but Saltines, bananas, and applesauce.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Maybe Rob will lose some weight by sticking to the bland diet. I really envy his pain medication.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon..."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know--I'll stay away from it.", "input": "", "output": "Can Rob teach in this condition?"}, {"instruction": "No, he took a few weeks off. At first, I liked having him at home because it gave me someone to talk to besides the cat and the rabbit. But he's such a whinny baby, he really gets on my nerves. I'm forever getting his medication, making something for him to eat, doing laundry, and cleaning up after him or the pets. All this domesticity is enough to drive anyone mad.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure Rob appreciates what you do."}, {"instruction": "No, he doesn't. He's been nagging me to go back to work. Rob was even pressuring me to go back to SII when I was still in the wheelchair--it was something about having too much time on my hands. Can you believe that?", "input": "", "output": "Don't you feel ready to go back to work?"}, {"instruction": "I'm still in a cast, aren't I?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but you've been upgraded, so to speak, to a temporary cast, and you seem to be a lot more mobile now. You're only using one crutch these days. That's a marked improvement from the wheelchair."}, {"instruction": "It's difficult for me to walk, and I tire easily, especially with all the running around I do for Rob. It pisses me off that he has the gall to tell me to get back to work.", "input": "", "output": "It's just a suggestion, Sharon. Why does it make you so angry?"}, {"instruction": "Because I've been busting my ass waiting on him, and he didn't do a fucking thing for me when I was injured. I had to drive myself to the hospital with a broken foot. He gets a minor infection and a little tummy-ache, and he's acting like the Sultan of Brunei, lying on the couch in all his corpulent glory, demanding that I fetch him this and bring him that.", "input": "", "output": "Rob's condition doesn't sound minor..."}, {"instruction": "Why do you always take his side?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not taking sides, Sharon. I realize you've had major injuries over the past few months, but Rob is also grappling with serious health issues. And he's much older than you are, and these conditions are more debilitating for an older person. I also understand that caring for a sick person can be unpleasant--they can be demanding and irritable. So please keep this in mind. I think this is a good time for you to use the relaxation techniques we've discussed."}, {"instruction": "I have been using them.", "input": "", "output": "You have?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, maybe not as often as I should, but I try to do it once a week.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like you to do them at least once a day, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay.", "input": "", "output": "Have you heard from Lila?"}, {"instruction": "Lila who?", "input": "", "output": "Come on, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Fuck her. I hope I never see that little cunt again.", "input": "", "output": "Won't you run into her in class?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't been going. I went to see Doris, our teacher, at her office to let her know I was still alive. She is really running out of steam. I wonder if she's okay, she looks run down. I tried to talk to her about things I needed for the Shitty Rag, but she looked so tired, I let the subject drop.", "input": "", "output": "Have you tried delegating your responsibilities to the other students?"}, {"instruction": "No one wants to do any work. Beavis and Butthead can barely write their own names. I can't ask Lila. Camel Toe--that horse-faced woman who can't decide whether she wants to be a ho or just look like one--turned-in some really bad poetry. She offered to help, but I couldn't face the thought of looking at all the folds of her genitalia clearly outlined through her pants, so I told her I didn't need help.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, you didn't even give this woman a chance. She may dress in a manner you find unappealing, but that has no bearing on her ability to assist you."}, {"instruction": "She makes me want to hurl. I don't want to have to look at that old Camel Toe, she's just too repulsive.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I know what you're thinking--I have painfully bad hair, and yet I have the gall to criticize someone else's appearance.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I was thinking that you are under a lot of pressure right now."}, {"instruction": "The always perceptive, ever compassionate, and politically correct Doctor Balis. You would never scream at me to pull my head out of my ass and get my shit together, no matter how much you might want to.", "input": "", "output": "Would you prefer I used a more caustic approach?"}, {"instruction": "You'd get better results with a thick-headed numskull like me if you acted more like a drill sergeant.", "input": "", "output": "That's a thought, but I think I'll stick with my own technique for now."}, {"instruction": "Yes, just look what great strides you've made with me so far.", "input": "", "output": "Therapy is a long process, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "It's a scam, that's what it is. You guys are nothing but third-rate con-artists, even worse than television evangelists and palm readers.", "input": "", "output": "But you come back week after week. It must have some value."}, {"instruction": "You're the only constant in my life. You're also the only man in my life who isn't too terribly physically repelling, at least not yet.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks for the compliment."}, {"instruction": "Sure. I'll see you next week, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I went to the doctor last Wednesday. It feels weird walking without it. I'm all wobbly, like I'm drunk or something.", "input": "", "output": "That feeling will wear off in time. Your muscles have probably atrophied, and it will take a while to regain strength in your legs. How is your foot?"}, {"instruction": "It hurts if I walk on it too much, but other than that, it's okay.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you're feeling better."}, {"instruction": "Actually, I think I'm coming down with the flu.", "input": "", "output": "Your hair looks good, by the way."}, {"instruction": "Oh, thanks. I went to a hair salon. I couldn't afford it, and it was really expensive, but I did it anyway. I used the money I was saving for a car repair and had my hair straightened out. I'm totally broke now. I was going to take a class at the local community college, but I can't afford it. I decided it was more important to have monochromatic hair than an operational vehicle or an education.", "input": "", "output": "It's good to establish priorities."}, {"instruction": "It's weird having short hair. It doesn't hang in my face anymore, and I can't hide behind it.", "input": "", "output": "I think it looks nice this way. How is Rob doing?"}, {"instruction": "Rob's taken a turn for the worse.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "He had severe stomach pains a few nights ago. He called Charlotte, and she took him to the emergency room.", "input": "", "output": "Charlotte?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, my car needs a lot of work, and he didn't want to pay for a cab or an ambulance, so he called his lovely and charming ex-sow to provide taxi service.", "input": "", "output": "I sense you're unhappy about this."}, {"instruction": "Very perceptive, Doctor. I guess I don't have the right to get angry. I'm not his spouse, so I don't have any rights.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did they find out what was wrong?"}, {"instruction": "No, all the doctors are stumped. Rob is the mystery patient. They've been running tests, but they don't know why Rob is in so much pain.", "input": "", "output": "Last week, you said Rob was diagnosed with the Peptic Ulcer disease."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but now they think it's something else. Rob says this is a different kind of pain. He really is miserable. He walks doubled-over, and he wheezes and moans constantly. He never makes noises like that when we're fucking.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He's been getting some great painkillers, though. Rob got a Demerol shot in the ER and a prescription for Percodan when they released him.", "input": "", "output": "Don't even think about it, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. I'm getting loopy on the cold medication instead. I can't smoke marijuana with this cold--it tears up my throat.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of cold medication are you taking?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm, it's some generic brand of NyQuil, I think.", "input": "", "output": "How much of that are you taking?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. A lot, I guess. I lose track after the first few swigs of the day.", "input": "", "output": "You need to be careful about the dosage of over-the-counter cold remedies. Some of them contain alcohol, not to mention a number of other substances that can be habit-forming."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. That's the best part of being sick.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon..."}, {"instruction": "There are other benefits, too. Like weight loss, for instance. My pants actually fit now.", "input": "", "output": "Proper nutrition is very important when your immune system is weakened. You need to eat regular meals. You should also increase your intake of fluids, such as water and fruit juices."}, {"instruction": "But I like that lightheaded feeling I get when I chug half a bottle of Ny-Quil or Robitussin and don't eat all day.", "input": "", "output": "When did you last eat?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Time is so amorphous, it swirls and morphs like the colored globs in a lava lamp...", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, please."}, {"instruction": "You know what else is great about being sick?", "input": "", "output": "What."}, {"instruction": "Snot and phlegm. I've been very productive lately. It gives me a great sense of accomplishment when I can generate a lot of mucous.

It's best to confront things head-on, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Wouldn't you rather hear more lava lamp analogies?", "input": "", "output": "No. Has Rob returned home from the hospital?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, they released him the next day. Charlotte drove him home and left me a nasty note about my poor housekeeping habits. What a fucking bitch! She even wanted to move in for a week to look after Rob.", "input": "", "output": "She did?"}, {"instruction": "Rob said no, of course. Even in his weakened state, he knows what hell that would be.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'm really pissed at him. All you men are users. You just take and take, like a bunch of bloodsucking leeches. Once you drain someone dry, you move on.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel used by Rob?"}, {"instruction": "He only kept me around so he could have someone to do his laundry and go out to dinner with. During a crisis, the first person he thinks of is Charlotte. He didn't even consider how that would affect me.", "input": "", "output": "Have you discussed your feelings with Rob?"}, {"instruction": "He doesn't want to hear it. Whenever I bring it up, he starts whining that he feels bad. I'm such a moron.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you say that?"}, {"instruction": "I'm stupid for thinking that he felt something for me. Ironic, isn't it? I went into this thing thinking it was only for practical purposes, and then I...", "input": "", "output": "And then what?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he grew on me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you love Rob?"}, {"instruction": "Ugh. Don't use the \"L-word.\"", "input": "", "output": "What word would you use?"}, {"instruction": "I don't hate his guts or anything. Actually now, I kind of do. What I mean is that we got along okay.

I don't have relationships. I just find people to fuck. And I don't even enjoy that half the time.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want a relationship?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know. Maybe.

But I'll have to wait another week for that, though.", "input": "", "output": "It must be difficult to report to work..."}, {"instruction": "Your brilliance knows no bounds, Doctor Balis. Yeah, it's a pain in the ass. The hardest part is trying to be presentable. I didn't bring that many work clothes, and it's difficult to go to the laundry more than a few times a week. One of the assholes in marketing--this big hairy wop--made a comment about my fashion sense...or lack thereof. I hate the way people look at me downtown. Everyone else looks so perfect in their suits and ironed shirts. But no matter what I do, I can't stay clean, and all my clothes get wrinkled.", "input": "", "output": "Where do you shower?"}, {"instruction": "I know I stink, Doctor, you don't have to rub my face in it.", "input": "", "output": "Sharon, I didn't say..."}, {"instruction": "I haven't taken a real shower in a while. I thought about using the ones at Ocean Beach, but the fog comes in, and it's freezing cold by the time I get off work. It's hard to keep warm. I've been using those public pay-toilets instead--the ones in the green kiosks that cost a quarter. I get twenty minutes for every quarter, that's almost enough time to clean myself up. It's hard to wash your hair in those little sinks, though. It's a good thing I cut my hair. I heard those public toilets self-clean. Maybe I should stay in there past the 20-minute limit and get myself hosed down along with the bathroom floor.", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't advise that, Sharon. You might be sprayed with industrial-strength cleaning solvents."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'd be disinfected, pine-scented, and fresh smelling, too. Maybe men would find me more attractive.", "input": "", "output": "You could try going to a shelter and asking to use their shower facilities. If you explained your situation, they might understand."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Homeless people are kind of territorial, and shelters creep me out. The ones who park along Fulton Street didn't take kindly to a new person joining their ranks.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been harassed?"}, {"instruction": "Not anything serious, just people looking in my car windows and making rude remarks. I feel like I'm trapped in someone else's nightmare.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Sounds like you've still got that sore throat."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I can't shake this cold. I hack and wheeze all the time. That's part of the reason why I have trouble sleeping. I can hear the whistle in my throat as I try to sleep. I'm hoping to develop a sexy, throaty voice like Lauren Bacall. Maybe I could get a job doing phone sex.", "input": "", "output": "Have you seen a doctor about your cough?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't want to take the time off work. I've used up all my sick leave already, and I've missed a lot of days. I almost didn't come here to see you.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you did. Sharon, I'm concerned about your health. You're clearly at risk for getting pneumonia or hypothermia..."}, {"instruction": "What the fuck do you want me to do about it? Where else am I going to go?", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps you could talk to Charlotte, try to reason with her."}, {"instruction": "Fuck her! I'm not kissing her saggy, dumpy ass just so I can live under her roof! It's not even her house anymore. She signed a quitclaim Deed as part of the divorce settlement. I'm fucking pissed. I feel like such a nobody. I always hear that shrill Doctor Laura's finger-wagging voice in my head: \"This is what you get for sleeping with a married man.\"", "input": "", "output": "How about your sister?"}, {"instruction": "No way! Remember what she said when my landlord threw me out on those bullshit child-molestation charges? She said, \"I told you to stay away from those kids.\" I don't want to give her the satisfaction of another \"I told you so.\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Are you getting enough to eat? You look like you're losing weight."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, all my life I've wanted that fashionable, heroin-addicted waif look. I just haven't had much of an appetite lately.", "input": "", "output": "You need to eat, Sharon, especially with that cold. You can go to a soup kitchen if necessary. I believe Saint Anthony's prepares hot meals on a daily basis at no charge."}, {"instruction": "I can't deal with all those people looking at me like I don't belong there. I'm not dirty and disgusting enough to look like a true homeless person, but I'm not clean enough to blend into corporate America. I'm always a misfit.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Are you able to keep warm at night?"}, {"instruction": "I wear a couple of layers and use garbage bags I steal from work. It's still chilly, but it's the best I can do.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps you could keep your car running and turn on the heater."}, {"instruction": "I can't do that. I have a leaky radiator or something--if I let the engine idle, my car will become a miniature gas-chamber on wheels. But that's not such a bad idea if I get desperate enough. Hey, that's an idea for Doctor Kervorkian--mini-suicide chambers on wheels. He could start a national chain providing assisted suicide on delivery. Depressed people could call 1-800-SUICIDE, and instead of a pimply-faced teenager bringing pizza to your door, he'd be packing you into a Ford Escort with the windows rolled up. I should give Doctor Kervorkian a call, we can haggle over who gets the patent. I wonder if he's allowed to get incoming phone calls in jail.", "input": "", "output": "Are you feeling suicidal, Sharon?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not exactly singing show tunes and skipping down the street with all the birds and animals in the forest following me.", "input": "", "output": "I need you to be honest with me, Sharon. If you're thinking of hurting yourself, I can arrange to have you hospitalized. At least, that would give you time to recover from your cold, and you'll have a warm bed to sleep in."}, {"instruction": "I'm not that crazy, yet. Besides, I don't want to jeopardize my job any more than I already have. I've taken more time off than almost anyone else at SII. If I lose my job, I'm totally fucked--you can have me committed then.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps if you talked to your supervisor and..."}, {"instruction": "No, I'm not telling anyone at SII. I don't want people snickering at me behind my back or feeling sorry for me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm very concerned for your health and safety, Sharon."}, {"instruction": "If I can stick it out for one more week. I'll be okay. Next week, I'll get my check, and then I'll find a place to live.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Sharon. If you change your mind, call me, I mean it. I'm here to help you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Well, our time is up. Take care, Sharon. I'll see you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Bye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sharon."}]
