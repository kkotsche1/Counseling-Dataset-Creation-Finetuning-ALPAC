[{"instruction": "Hello.  I'm Kester Langford.  Doctor Balis, I presume?", "input": "", "output": "Nice to meet you, Mr. Langford.  Please come in."}, {"instruction": "Where do you want me?", "input": "", "output": "Some people prefer the couch, others the chair."}, {"instruction": "Cool, thanks.", "input": "", "output": "So, what's the reason that you came to see me today?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I haven't been feeling my best. I just realized that I've been kind of holding my breath, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I guess I'm a little nervous and uptight. I've never done this before.", "input": "", "output": "Therapy?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You said over the phone that you couldn't really tell me what you wanted to talk about until we got together."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to try now?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, it's strange. I've got this thing that I like to do. In fact, I like it better than sex or anything. I'm not discounting sex. No, no. I'm just saying that this thing of mine is life altering. These experiences have shaped my life's path and direction.", "input": "", "output": "How is that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's hard to explain. Mostly all I think about is planning for and making my marks. It consumes me. Some people might even say that I'm obsessed with making marks. People call them designs on paper, canvas, pottery, on anything really. Sometimes I do it with markers, pencils, erasers, paintbrushes. I love it, but I can't seem to make it pay.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "Pay in a financial way. It wasn't my idea in the beginning.  It was more like a suggestion in a time of need. I started doodling when I was around eleven years old. I always thought it was pretty cool, mostly because it was fun to do and mostly because it took my mind off other stuff. At nineteen, I got serious about my marks and they became brushstrokes. Through the years, people and friends have told me that what I was doing was art and that I could sell my artwork and be a full time artist. Then, there were friends that said that what I was doing was a joke, not art at all, and who did I think I was passing these marks off as art? I've said no. I continue to say that I'm not an artist. I'm just a guy who loves making marks...and the creative process. But I still have to find a way to pay the bills, to eat, and to live indoors when I feel like it. There's no doubt that I'm caught in a dilemma.", "input": "", "output": "Learning to support yourself in a different way, that is?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. The problem is that I don't want to stop my mark-making lifestyle, but I would like more financial freedom so I could have more control of when and where I eat and sleep. Most of the time, I'm living in a room in someone's house or apartment or out in the open.", "input": "", "output": "Have you tried to get work to support yourself?"}, {"instruction": "I've always found ways to support myself--taking care of older people, working with kids in day care, being a chauffeur. That's really the point, isn't it, Doc? When I'm away from making my marks for more than a couple of hours or a couple of days, I start feeling uncomfortable. The intensity of unpleasant feelings reaches a state that making my marks takes over and I quit my job or get fired for not paying attention. All of this affects me.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "I feel like I'm off kilter, that I've lost my sense of balance.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like you've lost balance emotionally and physically?"}, {"instruction": "No. I'm only talking about my physical reaction. I don't believe any of that psycho babble mumbo jumbo.", "input": "", "output": "You don't believe that you can be off balance emotionally?"}, {"instruction": "I really don't want to go into that right now. I just wanted to tell you what I haven't been telling anyone else. This has really been bothering me. The feelings that I get from making, and painting, and drawing, and scrapping my marks are much stronger than my need for food and shelter.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, what do you think, Doc? Can you help me out?", "input": "", "output": "How do you think I can help you, Kester?"}, {"instruction": "I guess that's a fair question even though it seems pretty obvious to me. Come on, Doc! Most people are able to earn a living doing whatever they know how to do or want to learn to do. Even poor people. That's funny--I don't even consider myself a poor person and yet, in reality, I'm poor when it comes to things and food. But when it comes to energy, enthusiasm, and spirit, as well as the ability to express my own human voice among the people, I'm one of the richest men alive.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you've accepted yourself and you value what you do."}, {"instruction": "But that's really not the point, is it Doc? Can't you see what's troubling me? I mean, come on. I'm in a bind. I want to get unhooked from either my obsession with making my marks--which I'll never give up--or figure out how to support my habit of buying paint, ink, paper, and brushes, instead of buying food and a steady roof over my head. I'm not talking about ownership or anything like that, although that does cross my mind when I think about throwing my money into an apartment somewhere and helping someone else get rich. It's that old \"either I'm creating my own dream or I'm living out someone else's.\" I don't want to end-up in an institution or a jail somewhere.", "input": "", "output": "You have been giving this a lot of thought..."}, {"instruction": "Doc, this isn't something I'm just thinking about. I'm living this day and night for thirty years. Of course, I've thought about this for a long time. How about a life time?", "input": "", "output": "I didn't mean to give an impression that..."}, {"instruction": "Don't get me wrong, Doc, I can feel that you're listening to me and hearing me all right. I'm just frustrated having to deal with this over the past thirty years.", "input": "", "output": "I can imagine that it would be difficult."}, {"instruction": "Well, Doc, it's not really that difficult most of the time, you know? Actually, I feel like a free spirit. But there's an intermittent hang-up, a glitch, a very profound low. It's dark, and I'm terrified to do anything. That's when I can't even make a mark. That's really a problem, sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "I would very much like to hear more before I make any specific suggestions or recommendations. I would also like to see some of your marks.  Do you think you can bring some of your marks the next time we meet?"}, {"instruction": "That's cool. I can do that. I guess it's unrealistic for me to think that after talking with me for a short while, you could help me solve a conundrum that has been with me most of my life.", "input": "", "output": "Therapy takes time.  Not only will it take time to figure out ways of solving some of your problems, it will take time identifying exactly what those problems are.  But don't feel discouraged.  We had a good session.  Is there anything that you would like to say before we end for today?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really. All I really want to say is that I'm not as patient as I seem--I don't know how long I can hold out feeling like this anymore.", "input": "", "output": "I see. I've got to ask you this. Pardon me if it seems rather harsh and direct, but are you suicidal? Have you thought about taking your own life?"}, {"instruction": "That's an important question. There were times in my life when I thought suicide was an option. But right now, I don't have a plan or anything. I've decided many years ago that no matter how bad it gets, as long as I have a breath still in me, there would be a possibility of experiencing the gloriously positive aspects of my life. When I remember the times when I felt that all was right with me and the world, I become encouraged to continue living.", "input": "", "output": "I'm pleased to hear that. It seems to me that you have a lot more to offer and a lot more to experience in your life."}, {"instruction": "I think so.", "input": "", "output": "Now, does this time work for you?  Would you like to schedule our next session for the same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "That will be fine, Doc.  Well, okay.  See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Next week, then. That's July 1st at 10 am.  Goodbye, Kester."}, {"instruction": "Hello,  Dr. Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Mr. Langford."}, {"instruction": "Dr. Balis, I never did ask you if you mind my calling you \"Doc.\"", "input": "", "output": "No, that's perfectly fine with me. Thanks for asking."}, {"instruction": "I don't remember whether you called me Mr. Langford or Kester last time, but I prefer Kester.", "input": "", "output": "I'd be glad to call you Kester."}, {"instruction": "Well, I think we're off to a good start.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "I've brought some of my marks to show you but all of the images are turned towards the wall as you can see. Still, having them with me gives me a sense of safety. I'm glad that you suggested that I bring them to show you. Everywhere I go, I end up leaving a few marks, but I never know where I'm going to be sleeping or staying from day to day sometimes. Wherever I've stayed, people have been open to letting me leave some of my marks with them. Some people even like to hang them up while they're keeping them for me. I went to three different places to bring these marks to you. Also, I felt a little stiff last time with this artificial relationship that we are developing. I'm glad that we can just relax and work things out.", "input": "", "output": "What are the things that we're working out?"}, {"instruction": "The name thing and being able to share my marks. I can't imagine what you can learn from them to help me, but I'm open to just about anything, as you well know. Are you ready to see them or do you have some questions for me to answer?", "input": "", "output": "Well, more the point, are you ready to show them to me? Or is there a question that you would like to answer first?"}, {"instruction": "You're funny Doc. Sometimes you guys make things so complicated. I don't know how this therapy thing works. Don't you have some questions about my past or about my life...my parents? I'm just trying to be a good patient so I can get some help.", "input": "", "output": "I don't have any stock questions if that's what you mean. This is an organic process.  My questions are suggested by what you talk about--by what's important to you.  In large part, my job is to try to help you clarify issues which are important and relevant to you."}, {"instruction": "Whoa! That puts all the responsibility on me. Why do I need you?", "input": "", "output": "It's ultimately up to you to decide if I play a meaningful part in the process."}, {"instruction": "I think that it's way too early to decide. You seem like a good person with a good heart, and I like what you said about how you see your job. But I do remember that last time you mentioned you would give me some recommendations after you have gathered enough information about me.  That both encourages and scares me.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I was encouraged because I felt that you saw something in me that gave you hope and that encouraged you about my ability to break through and see the light at the end of the tunnel. But as I mulled that over, I felt uncomfortable with the thought that you could see something in me that I've had difficulty seeing in myself, especially after such a short time. I began to doubt that you saw anything and that you were just putting me on, which in turn frightened the hell out of me for a while. Whatever it takes to create something different for myself--that awareness, that skill--I believe that will be something that I'll have to develop over time. Of course, I'm in a hurry. I may be way out, on the edge of the envelope, but I know that to develop new habits takes a while. Of course I'm looking for a quick fix, but I don't believe that one exists. So, that's about it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Well you covered a lot of ground there.  It took a lot of courage to be honest with me and I appreciate that. You're right, there are no quick fixes.  The idea of our sessions together is that through our dialogue certain parts of your life, your personality, and your emotions become clearer to both of us.  I may have misspoken if I led you to believe that I would be examining you and then coming up with a plan. You're the one that's going to come up with the plans and suggestions. The more time we spend together, the more trust and understanding we will develop. And it's the process of working together which will illuminate the issues which are currently troubling you."}, {"instruction": "Doc, you really surprise me. I never expected you to respond so honestly. How about we look at some of my marks?", "input": "", "output": "It's your show."}, {"instruction": "That's it really. It's my show. That's what I'm learning. I painted this brushstroke with black ink on this 8 by 10 inch piece of pure rag paper. You probably noticed that I didn't sign it, yet. When someone wants to hang it up, we can discuss the signature, the color, the placement. This brushstroke has no preconceived meaning but it often symbolizes something when someone buys it or hangs it up. For me, it's many things. It represents time spent in a room painting and remembering my feelings, the sense of release and relief. The whole process symbolizes my own celebration of my own creative process. The day that I remember really doing my first mark and being totally aware that moment was the first time, I can remember feeling free. Until that moment, I had felt trapped. I couldn't seem to just relax and experience my own creative expression without criticizing my way in and out of it. I was not a happy camper.", "input": "", "output": "What else does it mean to you?"}, {"instruction": "It shows that I can express myself as a human being artistically, creatively.", "input": "", "output": "That's a gift."}, {"instruction": "I agree. But it comes with a price. It's not very popular or I'm not a good promoter or both. I can't put it on anyone but myself. I've done everything wrong. I don't write a diary like Asimov and I can't paint worth a damn, traditionally speaking only, of course, and most of my work is in black and white, and I haven't contacted enough of the right kind of people. I've just been having fun painting brushstrokes and drawing shapes, and writing an occasional poem.", "input": "", "output": "How would you describe your emotions right now."}, {"instruction": "Kind of bummed out.", "input": "", "output": "What's going on?"}, {"instruction": "It's unpleasant. When I think about \"reality\" it sucks. I feel bad because the thing that I love appears worthless to others. It's not that there aren't people who appreciate what I do, but they are so few and far between. Even $1,800 for a painting is not a lot if it's only among a dozen sold over a period of 30 years. I've decided that I produce so little that the prices must be high, so I recently went over to a friend's house and told him that his 4' x 5' acrylic on canvas that he was hanging in his living room now had a price tag of $35,000. I realized then that things had changed and something extraordinary was going to happen. You know it's really a fluke that I'm here, don't you, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "You mean, from SII?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. But it's pretty interesting. I worked as a proof reader off and on for several years, maybe five. Even though I haven't worked in over six months, I'm still covered under some residual insurance benefit.", "input": "", "output": "I'm losing your train of thought. I need to go back and connect some of the things that you said. You told your friend to quote a $35,000 price when someone asks about the painting. Therapy is being paid for by the insurance company and you're unhappy because you don't think enough people value your work. Does that sum it up?"}, {"instruction": "Reality sucks. If I were a cobbler, I would have shoes to make, sell, and repair. If I were a baker, I could bake fine breads and pastries and earn that way. But I'm a mark maker and I haven't made a place for myself that earns a decent living--some kind of living, at least.", "input": "", "output": "Many artists in our society producing fine art never really earn a living as artists."}, {"instruction": "Thank you for saying that. In fact it's funny, but I was just about to say how glad I was that you hadn't made that particular generalization about artists in our society.  But then, when you said it, it felt like I was hearing it for the first time, and I have to admit a distinct pleasure in having you include what I do in your definition of \"fine art.\"", "input": "", "output": "Well, obviously I'm not an expert.  But to me, what you do is clearly fine art, and you are an artist. I realize that you're still working on that one. What do you think is keeping you from making the transition from \"mark maker\" to \"artist?\""}, {"instruction": "Although it would give me pleasure, I don't have the gift that lets me draw and paint according to the art school model of what artists should be able to do. Most people think that if you don't draw well, you're not an artist. I didn't go to art school and all of the classes in life drawing and drawing and painting methods that I have taken privately have not been as much fun as when I'm alone expressing myself artistically and creatively. I think that I have a right to my own creative expression and that I should be able to sell it and make a living.", "input": "", "output": "I don't know much about the art business, but making art is only half of it.  You also have to sell art."}, {"instruction": "It's just another thing that I can feel bad about, because it's been happening for thirty years. With regards to the business of selling my art, does lazy ring a bell?", "input": "", "output": "Yes it does. By choosing the word \"lazy,\" you're subtly putting yourself down.  It's okay to move at your own pace.  Now you're considering picking up the pace with respect to the business of selling art."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to get too excited but this is sounding pretty good. I really appreciate your statement about going at my own pace. That's cool. Thank you for pointing out how subtly I can put myself down out of habit. That's a mind blower. This is getting more interesting all the time, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "What's the interesting part?"}, {"instruction": "Your ability to help me see how the words that I choose affect how I feel. I won't be using the word lazy any more. Thank you. It just occurred to me that if I were to make a list of people to contact and get into the habit everyday of doing something towards my goal of selling my paintings, then I would be encouraging myself every day, in a way, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "It sounds probable.  And it sounds constructive."}, {"instruction": "Yes. When I focus on all the negative stuff, it gets me down. Part of me believes that I don't have a right to be myself. I know that can't be right. I want to turn things around for myself because I feel great most of the time, but those lows are killers. Anyway, right now I'm feeling very good because I know what I'm going to do today and for the next week. I always take a \"let's see what happens\" attitude. It gives me breathing space. Realizing that making marks and the business of selling my work are two different skills, I can proceed with new energy and insight. That's amazing and so simple.", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned earlier that you write a poem now and then. Do you have any poems with you that you'd be willing to share?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. But I have to warn you. My poems aren't like any others that you've seen. First, they all have only seventeen syllables and second they are not want-to-be Japanese Haiku. They are sound poems of seventeen syllables.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have any with you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't have any with me but I remember quite a few by heart.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "The names of the poems are usually represented by their first word. Ready?  \"Life slips by my dreams of jewels and leaves shining pearls smiling wisdom.\"", "input": "", "output": "Would you repeat that again, a little slower please."}, {"instruction": "\"Life slips by my dreams of jewels and leaves shining pearls smiling wisdom.\"", "input": "", "output": "You chose to read that poem first.  Why?"}, {"instruction": "I wrote it 26 years ago. I remember what it's about even now. It's a code to say that although I have not succeeded in attaining riches, I have been showered with a gift of clarity that both grounds me to what I think of as routine reality and it also propels me beyond my own feelings of limitations. It is truly a beautiful thing when wisdom visits you. And I'm not being cute. I really mean it. I feel very fortunate to continue to live in a way that promotes insight and wisdom at times. It's another great reason to stay with the great fight of learning how to live in a way that is meaningful and true to oneself. I know that I'm unduly obsessed, but I know there's some good in that and I don't want to leave that good behind. I want to keep it with me.", "input": "", "output": "That seems like a good place to end our session today, okay?"}, {"instruction": "This session was much different from what I expected. Today was a pleasant surprise. I'm going to bring the marks that I haven't shown you today to our next session with a couple more poems, too. Would that be okay?", "input": "", "output": "That will be fine, Kester. Is next week at this time still good for you?"}, {"instruction": "Until the insurance runs out. I'll see you then.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, then."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc!", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Kester."}, {"instruction": "I started to call you several times to cancel our appointment but here I am.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you decided to come to the session today."}, {"instruction": "Isn't that a little premature, Doc? You don't know what I've been going through. \"Glad\" is a little too cheery for my part. Nothing would make me feel glad right now.", "input": "", "output": "What seems to be bothering you?"}, {"instruction": "\"What seems to be bothering me?\" Pardon me, Doctor Balis, that \"seems\" is very condescending.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't mean it that way. You appear very agitated today, so I was just inquiring about how you were doing."}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure that I really want to talk about it, but I will tell you that I didn't have a good week...or two weeks...whatever. From the time I left this session until right now, things haven't been going too well. I've been given a two weeks notice to move out of my room. And I didn't do any of the things we talked about last time--mostly I slept and watched television. I don't have cable, but fortunately I don't even mind having only a black and white set. I hate soap operas and talk shows. My life really sucks. And news make me angry.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So what's really bothering you?"}, {"instruction": "Very funny, Doc. Take your pick. What would you like for me to talk about first? My love life?", "input": "", "output": "I'm interested in hearing about whatever you want to talk about, Kester."}, {"instruction": "I'm asking for a little direction, Doctor. What do you want me to talk about?", "input": "", "output": "This is only the second time you've mentioned your love life. Is that what you want to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "No. I'd rather talk about where I'm going to live in two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about having to move?"}, {"instruction": "Shit! Pardon my French, but I told you that I slept and watched television. I'm scared, and I'm pissed off. It's just the same old thing. Who knows? As far as I know, I'm going to be sleeping on a park bench or under the freeway next week. And I have to figure out where I'm going to stash my current collection of marks.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Are you looking for a place?"}, {"instruction": "I really don't feel up to it, whatever it is. I always go to different coffee houses, read, and put up notices that I need a room. And then I wait. Sometimes I call the few friends that I have and ask them if they know of a place or if I could crash for awhile at their places.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you're going to do this time?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I just feel like everything is just in a hopeless mess. But if I had the energy, I'd like to keep going.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not ready to prescribe any medication for you, Kester, but would you be adverse to taking medication if I decide to prescribe some for you?"}, {"instruction": "Medication for what?", "input": "", "output": "I think you might be suffering from a cyclic form of depression, which is often triggered by a chemical imbalance in the brain.  We have some wonderful drugs to treat this form of depression, and I wanted to know if you'd allow me to consider this form of therapy?"}, {"instruction": "Who'd pay for the drugs?", "input": "", "output": "We'd arrange that through the insurance company.  But why don't we focus on first things first.  Do I have your permission to consider drugs in your case?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, I'll consider it, if you think it's important.  Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little strange right now, almost light headed. I think that I'm relieved in some way. I'm not sure what's happening to me right now.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you can describe it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, if I have a chemical imbalance, then there's a chance that I can take medication and feel better. I can maybe even improve the quality of my life. It seems like a glimmer of hope. I've been afraid that you might decide that I was really crazy, you know? Put me on medication or have me committed. Now, I think that taking medication can possibly save my life.", "input": "", "output": "I'm pleased that you agreed to take the medication, but I think that you're jumping ahead of yourself. Let's go one step at a time, before we come to any conclusions--just take one small step at a time."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doc. Fair enough.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel right now?"}, {"instruction": "It's hard for me to say exactly, but I feel better than I did when I arrived here today. I do have something to ask you, Doctor, but I'm uneasy about bringing it up.", "input": "", "output": "Is there something I can do to put you more at ease?"}, {"instruction": "Not really.", "input": "", "output": "Take your time, Kester."}, {"instruction": "Well, Doc, I want to know if it would be possible to hang one of my marks up on your wall? Wow, I actually spit it out.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Kester. I would like to, but I have a lot of patients and I have to keep the decor of my office as neutral as I can. If you notice, I don't even have pictures of my family here."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have any family, Kester?"}, {"instruction": "My parents both died within two years of each other. Mom died in 1990 and my Pop died in 1992. My older brother lives in Europe somewhere--we haven't talked in ten years. Chester is a high powered stock broker. Last time I heard, he was into his fourth marriage. We had a falling out, as I said, years ago, and we haven't spoken since. By the time I was able to talk, he had already moved away from home. He had a very bad relationship with the folks, so most of our communicating was done over the telephone. We never really got to know each other very well. So the short answer is that I don't have any family, no.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "Thinking about my family bums me out. But I'm kind of used to it, even though I don't like the way things have turned out. Actually, I'm feeling a little less agitated right now, but I'm still somewhat uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "Why are you uncomfortable?"}, {"instruction": "It's because there's something that I don't want to talk about. But I think I should talk about. It's really natural, and it doesn't really matter, but I'm very upset about it.", "input": "", "output": "Can you be more specific?"}, {"instruction": "It has to do with being a man. I'm totally embarrassed. I don't think I can talk about it with anyone, even though I think that it happens to most men. Not that I know the statistics, but it just seems like my time has come, like it or not.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you have a medical problem?"}, {"instruction": "I'm pretty sure that it's physiological and not psychological or emotional. But of course my fear is that I either have a real medical problem or something is really wrong with me emotionally.", "input": "", "output": "Sexual problems are always difficult to talk about."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, how did you know that I was talking about a sexual problem?", "input": "", "output": "You gave me a number of clues. But we are coming to the end of the hour, and I think it would be better to start on this next time. Does that seem okay with you?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so.", "input": "", "output": "What did you think of our session today?"}, {"instruction": "It was good, I guess. It seemed real short. And I'm still unsure about where I'm going to live and how I'm going to earn some money. The medication thing could be good. And I decided to be a little more personal.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad. Do you want to make an appointment for next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Same time, same station, all right?", "input": "", "output": "Good. See you then. Goodbye, Kester."}, {"instruction": "Good afternoon, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Good afternoon, Kester."}, {"instruction": "I guess I don't have to wait for you to ask me any questions for me to start, right Doc?", "input": "", "output": "It's up to you where and when we start."}, {"instruction": "Well then, I'll start by telling you that I was much more disappointed that you didn't let me hang one of my marks on your wall than I let on last week.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yes! When I left last time, I spent the next few hours off and on composing a see-you-later letter which included a good deal of profanity. I finally worked it out, because, as you can see, I am here. But it was touch and go there for awhile. You really pissed me off.", "input": "", "output": "Can you talk more about your feelings?"}, {"instruction": "You actually want to hear more about how utterly outraged I was by your rejection of me? I mean your explanation was logical enough, but logic was not what I was after. I really don't want to hear another well thought-out series of reasons about why it's inappropriate for you to hang my marks, because it's not going to make me feel any better. I know that no matter what I say, you're not going to change your mind, which, believe it or not, gives me some comfort.", "input": "", "output": "What was comforting about knowing that I wasn't going to change my mind?"}, {"instruction": "Well, while growing up, it was never clear to me what my parents were going to do or how they were going to act at any given moment. They always changed their minds about everything. It was impossible to read them, which I think contributed to my difficulties in making up my mind about things. They always told me to stick to one thing, while they were always going from one thing to another. My pop was a printer, but he was never satisfied with his job. So he went from job to job. And mom could never decide whether to get a job or stay home--I never could figure that one out. In addition to that, they loved moving from apartment to apartment. Sometimes, we'd move three or four times in one year. Yes, we're going to stay. No, we're going to move again. I had a hard time counting on whether I was going to stay with my new friends in the neighborhood or have to find new new friends in the new place. I hated moving from place to place. Sometimes, I think that I'm both of my parents rolled into one person.", "input": "", "output": "What are you feeling now?"}, {"instruction": "I'm feeling sad--way too sad, and angry as hell.", "input": "", "output": "How about you start with sad and then we can talk about being angry as hell?"}, {"instruction": "I miss my parents. They were the only real friends I've ever had. With all their shit, I always knew that they loved and appreciated me, even though they said many times that they didn't understand why I made my marks all the time. They even had some of my marks hung up in our house. I was happy to see my marks when I would visit them. But the truth is that it really didn't fit in with their decor, but I was their son, after all.", "input": "", "output": "Would it be accurate to say that my being firm was almost comforting because it set some limits for you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know about that, Doc. That's your department. You said no and that's what it meant. I was hurt at the time you said what you said. And then as the hours and days rolled on, I became more and more angry at you--I was yelling and screaming at you out loud and in my imagination. As the days passed, I realized that my sadness and hurt didn't have anything to do with you and that I was thinking about everything and everyone that ever hurt me. My anger became the kind of thing that encompassed all of my anger--my anger towards my parents for dying, my anger towards myself for not taking the next step towards my dream, my anger about getting older, and on and on and on. Everything is so interwoven and interconnected, it's hard to separate things out sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "What's hard to separate out?"}, {"instruction": "Why I'm so fucking angry, and hurt, and immobilized so often. With you, it seems that when you say something, then that's the way it is. I don't have to second guess when you're going to change your mind or to think about how I'm going to try to help you do that. It's just something that I don't have to worry or think about any more. I'm not going to have my marks up in your office. And I know that no matter how much I seem to take it personally--as a personal rejection or put down--that it's not. It's just what you say it is. You don't allow it not just for me, but for anyone. That's a clear message, and I hear it loud and clear. It just that it reminded me of the roller coaster events in my life which have hurt me deeply and which have intensely angered me.", "input": "", "output": "What or who do you think is responsible for your pain and anger?"}, {"instruction": "Is that a trick question or what? It's not about blame, Doctor Balis. It's about my own thoughts and feelings. It's about me. If anyone is responsible for how I feel and what I think, it's clearly me. That's the problem. If it were someone else, that would be easy to deal with. The difficulty is that it's me--my choices, my reactions to people and situations. That's why I decided to continue to show up to talk with you. The truth is that I don't want to give up my feelings and let go. I'm afraid that if I let go, I'll forget the most important people in my life, and I can't stand the thought of that.", "input": "", "output": "I can feel that there's something more there, Kester.  Do you want to share it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Doctor Balis, I have to admit something, but it will take me a moment to gather my thoughts.", "input": "", "output": "Continue when you're ready."}, {"instruction": "I don't really mind having to move, and I've always enjoyed my time living outside. I don't have a problem with that at all. Since my parents passed away, I haven't been able to function as well as I did when they were alive. I've been consumed with the pain of their loss. I could always go to them to share my excitement and enthusiasm about whatever project I would get involved in. When I would get down, they were there to help prop me up. Now, my life is like a morgue. My excitement has been diluted to marginal interest, into a downright \"who cares\" attitude. And it frightens me, because I've lived an exciting and somewhat charmed life, and the gap seemed to be widening until yesterday.", "input": "", "output": "What happened yesterday?"}, {"instruction": "When I left you last week, I went to three different coffee houses ready to post my requirements for a place. I found a note that offered room and board for doing security on the weekends. When I went to check it out, it was a studio apartment above The Range Gallery. It seemed too good to be true. The gallery had been vandalized recently, and paintings and sculptures were disfigured. The gallery had an alarm, but for some reason it malfunctioned. The insurance company told Jake to get a security guard or they wouldn't insure the gallery any longer. The note was a little misleading, because the job was for six nights a week. The good news was that I didn't have to wear a uniform or carry a gun, and there was a security system in the apartment with a monitor that covered the entire inside of the gallery. If I was willing to take the graveyard shift six nights a week, the place was mine. There was one hitch. One night a week, someone else had to stay in the apartment and watch the monitor. I agreed and I'll move in at the end of the week.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that you've found a place to live."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doc. Having my own place, so to speak, is necessary, but it doesn't really change my feelings and what I'm going through for more than a brief moment. Of course I'm excited about the possibility of showing and selling my marks in the gallery, but that will take time to evolve. Jake said that he spends a lot of time at the gallery, so there will be time enough to have him see my marks--now that I will be living upstairs. It could be really great, but I have to take one step at a time and not rush it. My marks are so unusual compared to other forms of personal expression, that I have to take a conservative wait and see attitude.", "input": "", "output": "Kester, I'm going to write an order out for a lab that's just down the street.  I'd like you to go and give them a blood and urine sample."}, {"instruction": "Is this something to do with the drugs that you were talking about prescribing?", "input": "", "output": "Something like that.  I'd like to check out certain things before prescribing drugs for you."}, {"instruction": "How long will it take to get the results?", "input": "", "output": "It usually just takes a few days. You're concerned about the results?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I think that's only natural. I mean it may change my life.", "input": "", "output": "I think that it would be better if we talk about that when the results are in."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Something really cool happened. I'm not sure, but I think it helped me sort out my feelings of anger towards you and then, of course, towards myself. While I was waiting to meet Jake at the gallery, I saw an old girlfriend that I hadn't seen or talked to for over six years. Evelyn Bliss--I could never forget that name. When she saw me, she came over and gave me a great big bear hug, and I hugged back. For the entire afternoon, we just talked about old times. About how in love we were then, and the good times we had walking hand and hand along the beach. She was a prayer answered, and I don't pray.", "input": "", "output": "What else did you talk about?"}, {"instruction": "We discussed the gallery thing. She thought Jake was a hunk. I couldn't read Jake's reaction. Anyway, she told me about this documentary film she was making--something about the effects of pet monkeys on mental patients. Truly, I was drinking her in. I was feeling how exciting and stimulating--almost uplifting--it felt to be around her. Of course, she was leaving town the same night for somewhere in the push to be a part of another documentary experience. She's really cool!", "input": "", "output": "You still really care about her, don't you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I really do.", "input": "", "output": "How would you describe our session today?"}, {"instruction": "Well, today I actually felt like a different person from the one that came in to see you six weeks ago. A lot of feelings are coming up for me. That's intense. And...well, I think that I'm opening up, but that I have ways to go before I get everything out. If you know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "Definitely something to discuss next session.  And, as I recall, we were going to talk about a sexual problem.  Maybe we can take that up next session as well."}, {"instruction": "Sounds like a plan.", "input": "", "output": "How's next week at this time?"}, {"instruction": "Good. Goodbye and thanks, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Kester."}, {"instruction": "Good afternoon, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Good afternoon, Kester."}, {"instruction": "Today I'm feeling like I don't need to be here.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about it."}, {"instruction": "Everything's so new and exciting now. I love my new place and the job is cool. It's about waiting and I can really understand the whole concept well.", "input": "", "output": "You feel like you've been waiting?"}, {"instruction": "That's an understatement, but today I'd rather focus on what's really working for me. That's all right, isn't it, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Perfectly all right."}, {"instruction": "There's so much I want to share with you today. Don't get me wrong, Doc. I don't think that all my deep-seated doubts, fears, anxieties, and emotional problems have suddenly disappeared and that they have been assimilated with great ease and aplomb. I just had a good week and I want to celebrate. Part of what I want to be doing here today is celebrating with you. In fact, that's what I always want to be doing, but that's a little out there. Anyway, what do you want to hear about first, the new pad, the girl, or the job?", "input": "", "output": "Kester."}, {"instruction": "I know, Doc. I just wanted to see if I could get you to express a preference. I don't really care, but if I were being asked, I would choose the girl. So I'll go with my gut feeling. What do you say, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "You're very playful today."}, {"instruction": "Yes I am. I feel like the cat that swallowed the canary. It's kind of a giddiness. Many of my friends believe in Karma and that things are just meant to be. I think I believe in serendipity. Everything that feels good that's happening to me is happening all at once, like an avalanche of everything's okay. I don't mean to be beating around the bush but there are so many thoughts and feelings that I want to just say everything at once. I can't believe it. I think it's natural for me to feel good about getting a great studio and better than expected place to live all together with a job and to top it off Evelyn Bliss, this goddess, spent two days and nights with me, helping me to unpack and helping me to initiate the bedroom set. Yes, Doc, we used plenty of condoms.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Her last name is really Bliss? Wasn't she the one who was leaving town?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, and that's what's so amazing. I got my friend with a pick-up to help bring my stuff over to the apartment. One comfortable rocking chair, with pillows and a double futon. Some linens, blankets, assorted mugs, my hot plate, and two wine glasses. There were three but one got broken in the move. Actually I put a heavy box on the box that had the glasses in it and the glass broke. Just as I pulled up on Friday to move in, Evelyn's flight got canceled--something to do with the AIDs epidemic in Zaire. I thought she was going to the Amazon, so I was really out of it. Her departure was delayed three days so we spent two of them together. You see, I was jealous of the guy that she worked with. Who wouldn't have been--tall, great build, just got his Ph.D. in getting paid to go around the world and write articles and books. Tough job but somebody's got to do it. Sometimes I feel like everything I say is a clich\u00e9, but that's another topic. I am not that interested in that right now. Back to Evelyn. Do you have any questions?", "input": "", "output": "No, not at this time."}, {"instruction": "Sounds a little serious, Doc. We're celebrating, remember? When Evelyn was in town years ago, if I weren't with her most of the time, she felt left out, ignored, and she used to tell me that I spent too much time alone. Not that I was doing too much work. She always encouraged my mark-making, but she thought I should spend more time socializing in general and much more time specifically with her. When she was in town, Evelyn demanded all my attention, from my perspective, and so that was that. We were frustrated with each other. We were always open and honest with each other but we just needed to go our separate ways. We hugged and cried when we split up. We love and respect one another but our life timing is quite different. Viv\u00e9 la difference! We spent several hours a day in each other's arms, laughing, giggling, yelling and screaming, moaning and groaning. We spent a fair amount of time crying and was that incredible. Evelyn said that she hadn't been able to let go and just cry for at least five years. Crying isn't a problem for me, but this was a different kind of cry, from my very depths, the core of my being. It seems like I've been having a lot of experiences that require everything that I've got to give. Isn't that strange, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "It seems like you're saying something, more than you're asking me a question. Is that accurate?"}, {"instruction": "I would say that it's very perceptive on your part but that's your job. Actually, I've been thinking more and more that that's my job.", "input": "", "output": "What's your job?"}, {"instruction": "It seems strange that one moment everything seems to be falling apart and the next moment things seem great. It's just life. My job is to pay attention to myself and watch what's happening in a way that is self-affirming and healing. Evelyn has been talking about healing a lot--that sounded like something that she would say. She's so cool. She admitted to flirting with that guy years ago.  She said that it wasn't anything serious, but she did sleep with him once. When I heard that, I felt myself getting angry and pulling away. We talked about how I was feeling and we really took care of each other. Sometimes I think about getting it together so I could take care of someone like Evelyn, but she doesn't need taking care of in the way that I was thinking. She is an independent soul, and that's what attracts me to her, one of the things. She's well built and fits perfectly, just like puzzle parts, and she's smarter than I am. I like the challenge. She says I'm very creative and romantic. I lit candles. The cabernet she brought was delicious. I was glad that the two wine glasses survived the move so we could make a proper toast. I read her some of my poems and some poems by T.S. Elliot and she helped me hang up some of my marks on the wall. I feel like I'm talking too much.", "input": "", "output": "You said you wanted to celebrate. Do you feel like you're celebrating?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I do.", "input": "", "output": "Then, continue. I can see that you feel like a very lucky man."}, {"instruction": "I have always felt very lucky, but the wind was taken out of my sails for several years, and I forgot where my center was. I didn't really forget. When my parents died, it was like being kicked in the groin by a giant. It sounds funny to say it out loud but the absurdity expresses something beyond anything anyone can say. I can't help from smiling when I think of the time I've been having the past few days.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like something to savor."}, {"instruction": "That's for sure. I complain about my aches and pains, and every problem I ever have.  It's like I use them as an anchor to pull me down, so why not celebrate what makes my spirit sing and my appreciation soar.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds reasonable. What else happened that you would like to talk about that you think is important?"}, {"instruction": "Several of our conversations, Evelyn's and mine, were very interesting and important to me, but I think I would rather talk about those some other time, if that's okay.", "input": "", "output": "That's totally up to you."}, {"instruction": "I discovered that my apartment is actually bigger than I'd thought. It's gigantic. Not only does it have a sink, a four-burner gas stove, refrigerator and an air conditioner but there's a storage area that I can use for painting and storing my paintings. The apartment is the same size as the gallery downstairs but the storage area is actually bigger than the living area of the apartment. It's not finished off like a normal room with walls--it's all open studs, a skylight, double windows on three sides, and an unfinished raw plywood floor. Jake seemed genuinely pleased that I was going to be able to use that storage area. The way things worked out, he really never got to see any of my marks, but he expressed an interest in seeing them as soon as I got settled in. When he came by, his mission was to give me the keys to the apartment and the gallery, show me how to use the alarm and tell me whom to call in case of an emergency. He left me a check list to go through each night and each morning with names and numbers. I agreed to work seven nights the first week to help him out. I was jazzed that he was so open to my using the storage area and to his interest in my marks.", "input": "", "output": "It does sound ideal.  You've had a very intense and productive week."}, {"instruction": "That's for sure. That sexual problem that I haven't talked about doesn't seem to be a problem any more, but I would like to talk to you about it anyway one of these days soon. I was wondering about my test results.", "input": "", "output": "Your tests came out fine.  All of your blood levels are within the normal range. That means that we can consider treating you with medication without worrying about a problem with your health in general.  But I'd say that no medication seems to be indicated at this time."}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "I think it's too early to being prescribing medication for you.  I'd like to get to understand a lot more about you before I decide if that is the appropriate course to take.  But I wanted to make sure that it was an available option if we decide to go that route, okay?"}, {"instruction": "That makes sense. Right now I don't think I need medication. I need to enjoy my new job and living space.", "input": "", "output": "I agree.  How long will Evelyn be gone?"}, {"instruction": "As far as I know, she's gone for a while. We took the Airporter together, her treat. It was great being chauffeured to and from SFO. I saw her get on Afrikaans Airline and I stayed until the plane took off. I definitely got teary eyed as she walked up the ramp. What a woman! She really filled me up with so much positive energy that it's hard to believe how differently I feel. She's a natural healer. What a gift!", "input": "", "output": "That seems like a good note to end on today. Any further comments?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. The time just flew by today. It's like I just arrived and now it's time to go. I really enjoyed myself. I don't know how therapeutic our session was today, but it felt good.", "input": "", "output": "Did you want to make an appointment for next week."}, {"instruction": "Sure, Doc. I am going to keep coming until either I have nothing to talk about or my insurance runs out. Thanks, Doc. See you next week. Same time all right?", "input": "", "output": "That will be fine. See you next week, Kester."}, {"instruction": "Good afternoon, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "What are you laughing about?"}, {"instruction": "It's rather involved.", "input": "", "output": "The session's just begun--take all the time you need."}, {"instruction": "I was reliving the incredible contrasts between how I felt when I first came to see you, the euphoria of the week before last, and the present. Wow! What a ride! I was enjoying my awareness of these contrasting transitions. I know it's like giggling to myself. It's a benefit of self appreciation. I get the impression that you don't think I like myself very much. I think you're wrong.", "input": "", "output": "Well, you're self appreciation has definitely gone up since we started together."}, {"instruction": "Thank you for not asking me to defend my opinion of myself.  Between getting set-up in the apartment and getting used to an entirely new schedule, the week before last was exhausting. I was so tired that I could barely appreciate what a let down it was when Evelyn flew off to her new adventure. I've had other girlfriends off and on through the years, but none like her; Evelyn and I are soul mates. What was really a relief was that she never noticed any difference in me during our very sensual love-making. I had recently become aware that I'm not as automatically physically turned-on or stimulated by seeing a sexy girl or woman clothed or naked. My mind is still hungry and full of desire, but my body only reacts to physical contact, like kissing or touching.  That surprises me. Talking doesn't do it anymore. Even five years ago, if we were having this conversation, I would have been physically aroused.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mean that you would have had an erection?"}, {"instruction": "Exactly. It's interesting to me to watch this transformation. I remember from my teens through my early twenties, being stimulated every morning and night--and quite a few times during the day--was normal for me. I've been noticing changes from when I was around thirty-five. It's been a gradual slow down. I think that I'll appreciate this change. It makes things a little simpler. I definitely feel less driven sexually, my mind is beginning to slow down to the pace of my body. But I'm very happy that everything is working just fine, though. There's just been a slow down in certain ways. It takes getting use to.", "input": "", "output": "You're describing a natural progression that most men go through. You sound like you're taking this in your stride."}, {"instruction": "I think so. I started telling you, that during my youth, I spent way too much time in a state of sexual arousal. Many times, I remember saying to friends that it was getting in the way. It's a lot more difficult thinking about anything but sex when you're so turned-on all the time.", "input": "", "output": "You mean with an erection?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. It's not that I don't think clearly, it's that I'm focused on doing something about my condition--making love, taking care of myself, or taking a cold shower. I've heard the \"cold shower\" suggestion throughout much of my life, but the truth is that I didn't learn it from reading, watching television, or going to the movies. Nobody ever told me, \"If you're horny, take a cold shower.\" It was a personal discovery. I used to take a lot of cold showers. Way too many, in fact.", "input": "", "output": "How many?"}, {"instruction": "Is that really very important?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I don't know what 'too many' means."}, {"instruction": "But it's in the past, and I'm telling you that it's not happening any more. I don't think my passion is gone. It was a kind of spontaneous intensity that I found more annoying and confusing than anything else. When my mind and heart were saying that what I wanted was honesty, closeness, a true caring, an exchange between loving human beings, my body was lusting after any female that caught my eye. I've always been attracted to strong women with opinions and lots of ambition. But I've often settled for someone warm, friendly, and near-by. Expediency and ecstasy were long time companions. I've never met a woman without some female problems, but that's a long story that I don't want to get into right now. I think that my mother only planned on having Chester and that I was a mistake. I'm not saying that I was unwanted, it's just that the enormous age difference between Chester and me was hard to miss. My parents had long gotten rid of any hand-me-downs.", "input": "", "output": "We're covering a lot of ground here.  What do you see as the important part of what you're telling me?"}, {"instruction": "I don't mind answering that, but it seems like such an odd question. Most of my life, I haven't really confided in many people. Maybe that's what's so special about Evelyn. I don't know why I'm totally uninhibited with her--we've always been search the depth of our souls.  That's rare.  Most people don't seem to be very self aware, or if they are, it's really superficial--they don't show a passion for getting beneath the surface. My marks have been my way of expressing my passion and, through the years, they've ended up serving as a wonderful mirror to see myself. At the very least, they reflect an aspect of me that is intense, profoundly satisfying, and exciting. The marks are very emotional, and their spiritual nature comes from somewhere deep inside me. They're so strong but rarely erotic. They've been at times more satisfying than most other experiences in my life. I feel like I'm trying to sell you on this. I'm really not.", "input": "", "output": "You're not?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'm not even trying to sell myself on my life's experience. As outrageous as it may seem to you, it's my life and I really love it. I just haven't had many people to share it with, and I'm glad to finally be able to express myself so directly in words.", "input": "", "output": "It's good that you're starting to trust me and can speak openly."}, {"instruction": "I didn't think that is was going to be this easy or this healing. Actually, this is hard. Last week when I wasn't here, I was really tired. I felt down and lost and abandoned. It was like being deflated after soaring so high. I think there should be some middle ground--like my Buddhist friend Oshiro would say.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'd like it to be more like roaming plateaus and less like riding roller coasters. I want to feel a stable, solid foundation beneath me. I want to feel more of a connection between what I'm doing today, what I've done in the past, and what I'm going to do in the future. Can I tell you about this new job?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "It seemed like it was going to be such a piece of cake. First of all, I have to lock up the gallery, set the alarm, check all the cameras in the gallery plus the two cameras outside. What a set-up. I had to call Jake at least three or four times to help me with certain details. And then it's very difficult to stay awake all night, and even more difficult to sleep during the day. Even though I was so tired during my vigil time, I had a very hard time falling asleep and staying asleep after my shift. The first week, it was like all I was doing was taking cat naps. I had to figure out a way to block the light from coming in through the windows. Jake gave me the money to buy some blinds and they work well, fortunately. I had a greeting card that I drew on the desk, and Jake mentioned that he thought it was cool. But there was so much going on besides my marks, that the conversation never went any further. I've had to learn to literally turn my life upside down. I don't know what I was thinking. Yes I do--I was desperate. I'm not really complaining, I'm describing what's happening as openly and as honestly as I can. I never got a chance to tell you about the board thing. You know, the job was for room and board. I have a weekly allowance for food, but I also have some half-price coupons for a place across the street that serves vegetarian everything.", "input": "", "output": "With such a change in your sleeping habits, how have you been eating?"}, {"instruction": "Even with the allowance and the coupons, I have not been eating much of anything. It seems that when I'm the most hungry, I'm also the most tired. So I can barely eat. And then when I'm ready to make my marks, I'm too focused and hyper to eat. I think that the changes that I'm going through--the new job and place to live--are good for me. It's actually more than just a place to live, it's more like a way of life. I don't mean to be overly dramatic, but it feels very different--good but different. I feel like there's been some personal growth.", "input": "", "output": "I think you are making progress."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to get too comfortable and lax about this job with the gallery business the way it is. Who knows how long it will last?", "input": "", "output": "It sounds wise to be a bit cautious, but you're just beginning this job, so take advantage of it while it lasts and see what happens."}, {"instruction": "I agree. We seem to be in sync this afternoon.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I think so too.  You covered a lot of ground today.  So I'll see you next week then, same day and time. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, that'd be great. Thank you. Bye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Kester."}, {"instruction": "Good afternoon, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Good afternoon, Kester."}, {"instruction": "I'm glad that you were able to fit me into your schedule--I thought about coming to see you every day last week.  But I was still just so lethargic that, by the time I remembered, I'd already missed my appointment.", "input": "", "output": "Why were you so lethargic?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know really. Well, that's not exactly true. First, I started having difficulty swallowing, but after a few days that went away.  Then I started having terrible headaches. Thank god for over-the-counter drugs. The headaches were so bad that when I coughed, I thought my head would explode. It was difficult dealing with being sick and having to work. I tried to get that other guy--the one that works when I don't--to take over for me, but he could only help me out for two days.

At the end of the letter, he even apologized for the letter and how uncomfortable it would make me feel. He told me that he had received Jesus into his heart and life. And now that he'd been saved, his mission in life is to help his friends, family, and strangers see the light of Jesus Christ. He told me that he prays several times a day and that I'm always in his prayers.

I felt so weird after receiving the letter that I called up my friend, Oshiro. We talked about the \"born again\" trip that so many people are on these days. We agreed that the whole feeling of the letter was really one of great desperation. The letter that I sent back to my brother was short and to the point. I told him that I was glad that he found God, but that I was not ready to accept Jesus Christ as the only son of God and the only way to my salvation. I started to write a lengthy essay about cross cultural beliefs and how peoples throughout history had their beliefs about creation and the purpose of life, but I decided not to send it. I decided that it wasn't important for me to try to change my brother's mind.", "input": "", "output": "What about the letter made you feel terrible?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe it felt like another form of brotherly abuse?

Five dollars for a box of assorted blank cards with some envelopes to sweeten the deal. The manager of the International Arts and Crafts Store saw my marks while I was buying supplies and asked me to make three dozen for them--she'll display them. I was jazzed.

She told me that her name was Meung Kim but that her friends called her Me. I told her that my name was Kester Langford, but that I used to like to go by Lang years ago. She liked Lang because it reminded her of a famous Korean artist whose work she's been studying. I packed up my stuff, and we went to the library together. When I took out James Joyce's \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" to renew, she started laughing and giggling and pulled out the same book from her purse--her constant companion for over two months. She's writing a paper on Joyce. That was it. We're not living together.

But I think I would react the same way to any of Chester's attempts to convince me that he has the answer to his, mine, and the world's ills. It doesn't compute. It's all really in my mind. My own descriptions of myself are simply slices of reality. I'd rather stick with my questions than submit to answers from anyone. My life is my adventure, and it's filled with many emotional and intellectual changes and challenges. Grieving--which is why I really came here in the first place--was new to me and difficult to handle alone. It's not that I've been without caring friends, but it wasn't enough.

It's difficult to talk about it, because I'm still suffering. It's a delightful conundrum. Although my work appears to be artistic and design oriented, my orientation is more of an explorer than an artist. My idea is that anyone can make marks. I am someone who enjoys making marks--designs, paintings, drawings. It's more of a way of life. It's more life than it is art. My work is an expression of one of my historical moments. The best way to title them would be to date and time stamp them.", "input": "", "output": "I'm still not quite clear as to what your suffering involves."}, {"instruction": "Maybe it's about not feeling that everything is all right all the time.

Are you hypnotizing me?", "input": "", "output": "No. Do you feel hypnotized?"}, {"instruction": "No, but the thought just popped into my head, so I shared it. When I was growing up, it wasn't until I was old enough to drive myself that I really started having friendships. Before, I only had my parents to share with, and that only went so far. It wasn't like having a brother or sister or even a best friend. Sharing is something I love to do. I'd rather give a painting to someone who will really appreciate it, than sell it to someone who is using it to match his decor. But don't get me wrong, I will sell current pieces at very reasonable prices, to anyone who wants to buy them. But the longer I have a particular piece, the more money I want for it.

Me is at least twenty years younger than Evelyn. I'm not sure what to tell either of them. I talked about Evelyn with Me, but I just said that she was a very good friend. I don't think I had to spell it out to Me, but for Evelyn...that's another story.

But she did manage to ask me when I was expecting. I laughed, but I didn't really think it was funny. When the blood tests came back, the doctor said that my tests were in the abnormal range and referred me to a gastroenterologist. I went to that doctor, and he told me that I had a tumor in my liver. Of course, that had nothing to do with my stomach and intestinal problems. The doctor said that he wasn't worried, but the tumor is the size of a golf ball! It's not his tumor, no wonder he's not concerned. Then came the big \"but\"--just to make sure, he wants me to have a blood pool scan. That's after my sigmoidoscopy.

Something inside of me has wanted to resolve the issues with my brother, even though the letter I told you about seemed to create even a greater chasm between us. Last week, I told you that I wanted to discuss our relationship in greater detail, but the problem is that I don't really remember much about him. He would talk to me over the phone, and that was all right. But every time he would call, my parents would get into a screaming battle. It seems to me that their arguing was about how they had failed as parents. And when I would try to stop them from fighting, they would start yelling at me and I would end up being punished.

I received a letter and then a phone call from my brother. This letter was much less preachy and more down to earth. Of course I have a healthy skepticism, but the tone seemed genuine. He said that he'd understand if I wouldn't want to speak with him when he called, but that he would give it a try anyway. When he called, we talked together for about thirty minutes, and it was surprisingly pleasant. I feel like this gigantic weight is starting to lift off my shoulders and off my life.", "input": "", "output": "Can you describe this feeling?"}, {"instruction": "Kind of. The word \"family\" would always give me a feeling of uneasiness. And my relationship with my brother--or my lack of a relationship--fueled my negative attitude. There must be very positive aspects to having a brother, and I've missed that in my life. In my younger years, I think the lack of a sibling at home was a factor during my promiscuous period. Fortunately for me, AIDS and HIV hadn't raised their ugly head yet.

My medical situation continues to be disturbing. My cramps and my feelings of uneasiness in my stomach and abdominal area is a little better, no thanks to anything that the doctors have said or done. So far, they have found nothing to explain my problems.  All I get are suggestions for more tests and lab work. \"Irritable Bowel Syndrome\" is the key phrase that these medicos have been bandying about with the explanation--get this--\"This is the diagnosis we use when the problem is not some serious condition that we can determine to be the cause of your pain and discomfort.\" I wrote it down so I could remember it. I heard the same statement from three separate physicians.", "input": "", "output": "You're obviously very angry about the way you've been treated.

The added twist is that my brother has sent me a round trip ticket to Paris plus money in a bank account in my name. He wants me to meet him and spend some undetermined time together in a Villa he rented outside the city. He contacted a dealer in Paris that agreed to represent me.

I'm finally to a point where my career may take off, but nothing is certain in that regard.

Except for this recent medical fiasco and my previous struggle with the death of the people that I love and who cared about me, everything has been moving along. Now, here comes the brother--the one that never gave me the time of day, or less--to my rescue.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you're feeling, that you're being rescued?"}, {"instruction": "It's really hard to know what I'm really thinking or feeling.

On the other hand, how can I leave Me without any definite plans to return? How can I leave my job as a security person for the gallery?

I find it humorous that you're going to help me with questions. I am eager to find out what kind of questions you have in mind.", "input": "", "output": "You've talked about how this possible trip to Paris would require you to lose everything that you have now, but what about coming up with a plan that would allow you to maintain what you've got going and still go to Paris?"}, {"instruction": "You're right. I've been taking about the worse case scenario. What you're suggesting is that I come up with a different plan. I actually have been thinking about that. I could contact Chester and explain my concerns and suggest that he help me figure out a way to make this idea of his work for both of us. For example, Me's course work will be complete at the end of November and she has December off. I could trade in the first class ticket and buy two roundtrip tickets and see if I could convince Me to come with me. That's one thing. I could have a sit down with Jake and see if I could work out the group show by getting everything ready in advance, but that's something that I could probably arrange. The real problem is who is going to be the security person for the gallery, and if it's not going to be me, will that scrub my chances for the group show?", "input": "", "output": "How would you feel if you could arrange everything the way that you described?"}, {"instruction": "I think that I would have mixed feelings. I'm actually more terrified of the thing with my brother blowing up than I am about losing my apartment or the group show. I think that Me would be very understanding and compassionate and would go along with whatever I decided. I could be wrong about that but I don't think so. Jake could go either way. He could either take it in his stride and work with me, or just give me notice and tell me to take a hike. I don't think that would happen but he's rather unpredictable. My problem is that although I can easily use the reality of my life as an excuse not to meet my brother, I believe that not meeting him would be a very big mistake.", "input": "", "output": "What's your biggest fear about going to see your brother?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe he's trying to brainwash me into becoming a born again Christian, instead of connecting with me without religious dogma. I want two open human beings to be meeting in Paris, not a Christian looking for a convert. As far as I'm concerned, I'm happy that he has found his salvation. But what is true salvation if it requires that others must be brought into the fold before they can be accepted as truly whole and complete human beings? Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill and that he just wants a brother as much as I do. There's only one way to find out and that's to go for it. How's that for using a question to my advantage?", "input": "", "output": "What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I got it. There's something that we've not talked about at all. I don't think that we've been avoiding it either, but I'm curious as to why you haven't asked how this possible separation will affect our relationship and my therapy?", "input": "", "output": "The time seems good now to consider that question, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "You have to be clever to be a shrink, eh, Doc? Yes, I think that it will be a challenge for me to give up my therapy now, but I also think that the benefits will far outweigh any problems I might have in dealing with things on my own. Anyway, we don't really know how long I will be gone or for that matter exactly when I will be leaving. If Me can arrange her schedule, and Chester is amenable to my bringing her along, and Jake and I can work things out, I won't be leaving before December.", "input": "", "output": "I have confidence in your ability to deal with your situation if you decide to go to Paris."}, {"instruction": "I appreciate that, Doc.

I agree.", "input": "", "output": "This seems like an ideal place to end our session today."}, {"instruction": "I agree but I do have one thing I want to mention before I leave today.", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "I can't stand my hours at the gallery. It's really grinding me down. This Parisian opportunity would be a perfect escape. I just thought I would mention it.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you did, but our time has run out for today.

Goodbye, Kester."}, {"instruction": "Good afternoon, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "How have you been?"}, {"instruction": "I guess you must be referring to my canceling one session and not showing up for another, right?", "input": "", "output": "I've been concerned..."}, {"instruction": "I guess being really interested in your patients is part of your job. I appreciate it, really I do. That's why I'm sorry I had to flake out on you a couple of times.

What should I talk about, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "What seems to be the most important thing to you personally right now?"}, {"instruction": "That's part of the problem--deciding what my priorities are and knowing how I should deal with my friends, family, and lovers. Before I get to the melodrama between my brother, Me, and me, I want to tell you about this idea that my friend Joe called me about. Joe called me out of the blue, and we talked about the environment. He had gone to a seminar called \"The Environment & You,\" and he was totally hyped on doing something in the Haight. He discovered that the local public schools are very inefficient at recycling. He wanted to know if I was interested in going into the recycling business with him. I explained to him that, although I agreed with the importance of living as ecologically as possible, it wasn't a high priority in my life. He was not happy with my response and went off on me. He told me to stop using acrylic paint--it was bad for the environment. That I should use only organic and recyclable inks and paints. About ten minutes after he hung up on me, he called back and in a very serious tone of voice told me to buy a truck and collect cans. And then he hung up again. I haven't heard from him in about a week, and I'm beginning to get worried. I called the halfway house where he lives, but the line's been busy. Joe's a Vietnam Vet, and his post traumatic stress syndrome flares up on him when he neglects to take his meds. How did I get off on this tangent?", "input": "", "output": "What is important to you about your friend Joe and what he had to say?"}, {"instruction": "Joe always makes me question my own values and take an immediate look at how I may be part of the problem instead of the solution. I have always held the view that if I'm doing something that is truly good for me, it would be good for others. That has been true to a point. But when he starts in on the inks and paints I use, I feel like I'm a hypocrite and that hurts a lot. I don't want to feel like a phony. Personal expression means everything to me, and the thought that my marks could have had a negative impact on the environment has an enormous impact on me. Fortunately, I've been able to solve that problem to my satisfaction just recently.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "I contacted the small business administration and the chamber of commerce and discovered that there are quite a few businesses that are based on using only recyclable materials. I contacted a printing company in Oakland, and I now have a steady supply of recyclable inks.", "input": "", "output": "So are you proud of yourself for replacing your old materials with ones that have been recycled?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes the magic works. I'm feeling pretty good about what I've been able to do, but I can't wait to tell Joe about it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I believe that for me, the idea of ecology and recycling represents a way of life that I agree with and want to promote in my life as much as possible. One of the reasons I like my job is that it is linked to my living arrangements by its very location, and I believe that I benefit the environment by not having to get into a vehicle to get to work. I have to admit that I didn't think about that when I took the job, but nonetheless, it does fit. Doesn't it?", "input": "", "output": "It does fit."}, {"instruction": "I got several phone calls from my friend Eric. He has been working as a telemarketer for a company that sells bonds. He's working on getting his Series 7 Stock Broker's license, but he didn't call me about that.

He had me so crazy that I was ready to give him all my money just to get rid of him.", "input": "", "output": "What made it so intense?"}, {"instruction": "First of all, he was so gung-ho that even asking the same question over and over gave him pleasure and an excuse to explain these stock market strategies he learned. The one strategy I remember him telling me was rather intriguing. It involved buying 1000 shares of a stock at around $10 a share, and then selling someone the right--but not the obligation--to buy the shares from you at $12.50 for a premium of $1,000. So you get to keep the $1,000 no matter what. You don't have to buy a thousand shares, but it's easier to think in round numbers. It sounded too good to be true. So I called up a stock broker, and he confirmed that it was a legal stock market strategy for generating cash flow.

And I don't like the fact that she's hurting right now and there's nothing I can do about it. I wrote her a thoughtful, caring letter. That's not very much, but it's all I can do for her right now. I really do love her. And on top of everything, I asked Me about coming with me to Paris, and she told me that I was getting too serious and she needed some space. I was shocked, but for some reason it didn't take much for me to recover. It didn't really bother me that much. We really have something special together, and I think that this is just a temporary glitch in our relationship. She's a lot younger than I am.

When I started the conversation, I was ready to arrange to visit him...the only thing that's for sure these days is that things keep changing. He jumped back and forth in the conversation--friendly and open to our new emerging relationship and then gruff and critical of everything I told him I do.

We were somewhat heartened, but it was several days before we began to see a dramatic improvement. I shared something that I had never experienced--being there for another person. That's really worth living and dying for. A mark is just a symbol of being present. But the experience and memory of caring for another person is a very complex set of thoughts and feelings, as well as personal doubts and fears. A sense of compassion has begun to swell up in me.

It seems as if there's a connection between learning more about myself and learning more about how the world works.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that you're making more connections now than you have in the past?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure of it. I've always felt like an open person, but my focus was very narrow and directed. Now, I feel less focused and more liberated. Do you get what I'm saying?", "input": "", "output": "You have a more expanded view of your personal life and the life that surrounds you now."}, {"instruction": "You're really on the money this afternoon, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes the magic works."}, {"instruction": "You're loosening up, too.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe both of us are."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I think I'm out of steam, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine, we're just about out of time. Was there anything else you wanted to talk about briefly before we conclude our session?"}, {"instruction": "Belated Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.", "input": "", "output": "Happy holidays to you, too. I'll be taking a two week vacation starting next week. In case of emergency call the service. There will be a doctor on call. And in an emergency, you can always talk to me directly."}, {"instruction": "Have a good vacation, Doc. See you next time.", "input": "", "output": "Great.  Let's see, our next appointment will be Tuesday, January 27th at 1 pm, okay?"}, {"instruction": "That's fine.", "input": "", "output": "Great.  Goodbye, Kester."}, {"instruction": "Good afternoon, Doc. Yeah, it's been a while.", "input": "", "output": "How are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, I'm doing well. I'm very satisfied.", "input": "", "output": "What is so satisfying?"}, {"instruction": "I'm emotionally on a very even keel right now. I've been thinking that I wasn't going to come to see you today. But I've been away for several weeks, so I thought I should show up and share what's been happening with me. That sense of purpose that I was talking to you about last time we talked has been growing stronger, which is a pleasant surprise. It's really quite refreshing not to feel so driven. Don't get me wrong, my focus is still strong, but in a much different way. It's actually hard to put into words exactly.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to try?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I would. I think the best way to explain what I mean is by example. Jake came to me and said that he was becoming more and more impressed by my work and by my attitude about my art. Now, that's one thing that has changed.", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "Calling my work \"art.\" I can say it with pride, with a smile, and with a good feeling. I don't feel like I have to explain it the way I did before. I'm not talking about the explanation of my art as gestures, or brushstrokes, or even personal historical moments. My discomfort with myself has been transformed in some way.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mean that now you are comfortable with calling your work \"art?\""}, {"instruction": "In a very simplistic way, I'm experiencing the meaning of the phrase \"It's okay, I'm okay.\" It's not so much what I've been doing that has changed, it's me, the doer, that has changed.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "My several conversations with Me's aunt in the hospital continue to affect me. I was there for her, and it feels like she gave me back a part of myself that I didn't know was missing. Now that Aunt Maymilu is back home and doing well, I've continued going to see her. I feel like my relationship with Me is my bridge to a relationship with Maymilu. Me and I are actually still involved, but involved in a changing way. I will forever be indebted to Me, no matter what happens between us in the future. And Me has been very important to me also. She came along when I really needed both a friend and lover. I was much more needy then. But my needs have changed considerably since then. In some ways, Me wants me to be the way I was. But I can't; I don't want to be the way I was. I'm not sure exactly what I'm talking about, Doctor. But whatever it is, I just feel so much better, freer, more whole, and more balanced now.", "input": "", "output": "I see. You've described some changes in your attitudes and feelings. I sense there is a change in your relationship with Me.  I'd like to understand more about that and about your relationship with Me's aunt."}, {"instruction": "Just hold on, let me continue. Now, I can sit quietly without having to create peace through the ritual of my brushstrokes--through my marks. Since these changes in me, I've been sleeping much better. Facing the possible death of Auntie May-mi put my inner turmoil in perspective. It's all less dramatic, less significant now. I mean it not in a pejorative way, just in a routine one. Am I making any sense to you? Are you picking up on what I'm trying to share with you?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure. I gather your perspective has changed by your recent experiences."}, {"instruction": "Our last session is so vivid in my mind, I feel like I can recall everything I shared with you. It's because I shared something that I had never experienced before--being there for another person, getting a handle on what's really worth living and dying for. My marks have always been vital to my daily functioning. But as I told you last time, they are just symbols of being present. The experience and memory of caring for another person is more vital to me now. That compassion that I spoke of has continued to develop in me. What a miracle. I feel like dedicating my life to caring for others, but not because I have to or because I'm driven to it, but because it feels natural and easy, like the first mark I ever made. Aunt Maymilu and I have been visiting several retirement hotels. I've been visiting with the people there and sharing my thoughts, my feelings, and my art and poetry with them. And I've been asked to come back.", "input": "", "output": "That's great."}, {"instruction": "Over the past few weeks, I've been offered a stipend to go and do this on regular basis. Me doesn't know what to make of this whole thing, but she seems to be happy for me. But I'm spending more time with her aunt and her aunt's friends than I am with her. Me understands; she says that she supports what I'm doing. But I'm getting mixed messages.", "input": "", "output": "What are they?"}, {"instruction": "It's ambivalence. I don't like it, but I think I understand it. She was having a relationship with a person, and now that person is not quite the person she thought. But I really don't want to talk about Me and our relationship. Is that all right with you?", "input": "", "output": "That's fine. What would you like to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "When I talked to you about my marks during our last session, I mentioned that they have something to do with my mortality, my life, living and giving something that would last beyond my life--something that would live on. I now believe that it's my relationship with people that will live on and make my life meaningful. My art has been my way of celebrating life. But it's also been protecting me from certain aspects of life that were difficult for me to face. Now, my relationship to my art has changed. Wow, it feels so good to call it \"my art.\" What a relief. I always had a negative reaction to critics of all types. I guess that's one of the reasons I had never thought about going into therapy.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "That's another story. What a realization to discover that I'm the one who has been my own worst critic all my life. This new feeling that I have--a feeling of being full instead of feeling empty--has quelled the critic in me to a large degree. Now when I catch myself being negative and critical, I just smile and celebrate it as an opportunity to recognize that I've chosen a new focus in my life. It's these new feelings of compassion and caring. It's strange, but it's so incredible. Part of me wants to go on the roof tops and shout it out: \"It's okay, life is the opportunity to discover passion, love, and self acceptance.\" In these past few weeks, once again, I've spent most of my time with people who appreciate me for me, just for me. The noticeable changes that I see in people when I come to visit them are incredibly rewarding. It's like nothing I've ever experienced before now. It's like a miracle. I told the people that I've been visiting how these visits have changed my life and how they are helping turn my life around. Some of them just think that I'm being nice and appreciate it. A few of them really understood what I was saying to them and we made a great connection. Can you believe that I'm actually going to get paid for doing what I love?", "input": "", "output": "That's always good."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes.  I'm a lucky man.  And I know it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'd like to talk about Jake.  He's been upset because business had not been up to his expectations, and he had several cancellations lately. He asked me if I would be interested in having a one man show, and I agreed. The particulars are still not nailed down. And I've discussed with him moving out of the gallery. Jake said that he would try to get a replacement for me, but he was irritated that he had to also deal with that. He said he still wanted me to have a show.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Do you know where you want to live now?"}, {"instruction": "I've got a few possibilities. I'm considering living in a combination of a few retirement hotels. But it's all in the future. For now, I'm just going to go with the flow as best I can. I talked with Chester and told him what has been happening with me. He seemed really open to me. I believe he's becoming more accepting to new ideas. In fact, both of our perspectives have gone through major changes. I'm sure that it's just as much my change in perspective as it is his that is having me see him in a new light. We plan to get together some time this year, maybe in the summer. Who knows?", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be working to understand what's going on inside of you."}, {"instruction": "That's truly an understatement. My smile feels new and fresh. Everything seems much less forced. I always thought that I was a very relaxed, easy going guy. But compared to now, I think I must have been quite uptight. I don't like thinking about myself in those terms, but my narrow focus--although celebratory--was also exclusionary, and that's just a fact. There's no put down, no judgment, just an additional light of awareness, you might say.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It seems like I'm thinking more clearly now, and have a new openness to insights about myself. Well, mostly it feels great. I continue to savor my new perspective and understanding. And it doesn't seem like it's something that will go away because it's based on my own personal experience and not on anyone's theory about me or my life. I feel more comfortable with myself, and I'm not second guessing myself. I'm just enjoying my expanded feelings and thoughts as well as my new friends. This experience is not an 'either or' situation. My feelings of exhaustion have become a non-problem. My working hours have not really changed, but in the same amount of hours, I'm getting more relaxed sleep. I'm feeling like I have more energy than before. Life is so strange. It's still quite unexpected, but quite nice.", "input": "", "output": "We're just about out of time. Was there anything else you wanted to talk about before we conclude our session today?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I think I've said pretty much what was on my mind and in my heart. I'll tell you one thing, I feel like my language and choice of words are changing in front of my own eyes.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "I hope you had a good vacation.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Kester, I did. Will I be seeing you in a couple of weeks?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, that will good.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, let's see.  How about Tuesday, March 10th at ten in the morning?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  Goodbye, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Kester."}]
