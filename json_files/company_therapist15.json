But he started getting irritable and he's made my life a misery for weeks now. I think he believes I'm lazy. As if he can't see I'm working like a dog.

Are you worried about confidentiality?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes, I should think so.", "input": "", "output": "Let me explain. The advantage of using a portable computer is that I can take it home with me at the end of the day. No one gets to use it except me, and it's not left in this building overnight."}, {"instruction": "But what if you're robbed on the way home? Someone could steal all your records at once!", "input": "", "output": "I think anybody who stole this machine would be far more likely to wipe its hard disk to eliminate evidence.

You hear about it.", "input": "", "output": "I've read the security instructions. It's not a password which could be easily guessed. And I change it every month or so. Please trust me, George--I've taken an oath to keep what my patients tell me confidential."}, {"instruction": "Is it plugged into the Internet? Aren't you worried about the hackers?", "input": "", "output": "It was for that very reason that I decided not to network the computer.

There's no network connection."}, {"instruction": "You're very sure, aren't you? Very sure you understand it all?", "input": "", "output": "This is just an ordinary power cable."}, {"instruction": "Why do you need a cable at all?

I have carpal tunnel syndrome.", "input": "", "output": "Does it cause you a lot of pain?"}, {"instruction": "Some days I hardly notice it. Other days it can stop me working. Today it's irritating.", "input": "", "output": "You weren't wearing the brace during our session last week."}, {"instruction": "No. I don't like it. I don't have to wear it all the time. I sleep with it every night, that makes me feel enough of an idiot without wearing it to work when I don't need to.", "input": "", "output": "How long have you suffered from this?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, a year or so. Maybe two.", "input": "", "output": "So you were at SII when it developed."}, {"instruction": "What has that got to do with anything?", "input": "", "output": "It's important that I'm aware of something which is causing you pain on a regular basis. Perhaps I can help you deal with the effects of that pain."}, {"instruction": "It's just something I have to put up with, Doctor. Stop grasping at straws.", "input": "", "output": "George, that's not right. I'm not sitting here trying to find a weakness in you to exploit. And I'm not compelling you to be here. I'm very willing to work through anything that you want to. But we can't make progress if you fight me all the way."}, {"instruction": "Sorry Doctor. Forget I said that. The pain does make me irritable. I know you have good intentions. But you're just a tool that Taylor is using.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think he's using me for?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps you could do something for me."}, {"instruction": "What's that? Not happy with your desk? Your chair?", "input": "", "output": "My furniture is fine, thanks. I was wondering if you kept a journal?"}, {"instruction": "A journal of what?", "input": "", "output": "Your thoughts, your feelings. Anything which occupies your mind."}, {"instruction": "No, no, nothing like that.", "input": "", "output": "I was going to suggest that you keep a journal of your clashes with Mr. Taylor. Perhaps we could use it to explore the situation."}, {"instruction": "I don't have time for that kind of thing, Doctor. I'm too busy.", "input": "", "output": "Please think about it if you find the time."}, {"instruction": "Our session is only supposed to last an hour, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "That's right. We are getting short of time."}, {"instruction": "I dare say I'll be back in here next week.", "input": "", "output": "At least I'm not the dentist."}, {"instruction": "Hah! That's true. I'm sorry to keep wasting your time like this.", "input": "", "output": "You're not wasting my time."}, {"instruction": "Mmm. I'm sure.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week George."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor. How are you?", "input": "", "output": "I'm fine thanks. But shouldn't that be my question to you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm only being pleasant, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You seem weary today."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes I feel that way.", "input": "", "output": "Often?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Do you enjoy your work at SII?"}, {"instruction": "I used to. I don't enjoy it much anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Does your conflict with Mr. Taylor get in the way?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. But that's not all. It's a changing job, Doctor, and it's moving away from me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Taylor and I clash because of our personalities. But it's not just our personalities. We represent different factions. I stand for quality service, the personal touch. I really believe that if you approach a job like mine with the right attitude, you can improve someone's day.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds good."}, {"instruction": "Doesn't it? And you can prioritise according to people's needs. You can make a value judgment based on how people ask you for something and how crucial it is to their work.", "input": "", "output": "What faction do you think Mr. Taylor represents?"}, {"instruction": "Assign the request a priority between one and five. Each department is allocated a limited number of high priority requests per year to ensure equitable division of resources.", "input": "", "output": "You sounded like you were quoting there."}, {"instruction": "I was. And I'm sure you can guess who wrote it.", "input": "", "output": "Can we explore Mr. Taylor's attitude a little further?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "Well, what do you think motivates him?"}, {"instruction": "Making my life a misery. No, that's not true. He thinks he's doing the right thing. It's just that he puts the system first and people second. He's not so interested in whether our customers are satisfied, because he has his own little model which he keeps on his computer. As long as everybody keeps the model up to date, what does it matter whether we actually do anything?", "input": "", "output": "It sounds to me like you would be happier being in charge."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I would. And it would be a better department. But they're not going to put me in charge, so I can forget it.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say that?"}, {"instruction": "I'm too old, Doctor. They're a high-tech company. They want whiz kids who rush around striking dynamic poses. Even their psychiatrist uses a...it's not there. Your computer.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I put it away. I thought it was making you uncomfortable last session."}, {"instruction": "That was thoughtful of you.", "input": "", "output": "I would like you to get the most out of these sessions. I know how strange they can seem when you're new to therapy. I would like to do anything I can to put you at your ease."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry. I must be a really frustrating patient.", "input": "", "output": "Believe me George, I've had patients who are far more frustrating than you."}, {"instruction": "It's not even just the job. It's the world. There's no room for people like me anymore. It's more important to be seen to do the right thing than to care. I used to really like working at Gray & Hempel. I really knew what I was doing. People respected me. They enjoyed dealing with me and, if I couldn't help them, I would explain why. But I wasn't young or shiny enough, and in the end the company decided they could get by without me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel you're not respected in your current job?"}, {"instruction": "The personal touch still counts for something when you talk to people. But everyone's so busy here all the time. They don't want a pleasant exchange; they want everything done right now. If you're not that kind of person, if you're not good at...", "input": "", "output": "Not good at what?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, like I say, it's not just the job, it's the world. People hardly talk to their neighbors nowadays. Everyone's suspicious and isolated in their own worlds.", "input": "", "output": "You seemed like you were going to say more about dealing with your customers. They want everything immediately, you're not good at..."}, {"instruction": "No, no, I don't know what I meant. The point is, I would have been happier before life got this way, so fast and inhuman. I think I would have really fitted in to the golden days of family businesses, when people were proud of where they worked. When the owners would assemble the workforce to make announcements, and they would be genuinely respected. They would look after their workers. Do you know what I'm talking about?", "input": "", "output": "I think so. Are you saying that people respected one another as human beings more in the past?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, that's it. Mutual respect. Now it seems that's gone. We can put a dollar value on human life these days. I read about one insurance company which has a fire-fighting system to protect its big computers. If the sensors detect a fire, the room is automatically sealed and gas is sprayed in. It can put a fire out in seconds. But the gas is deadly poisonous, and there's no escape route. If you're in that room when the thing triggers, you're killed very quickly. Isn't that horrific?", "input": "", "output": "It is."}, {"instruction": "And do you know why it's built that way? Because the company believes their computer files are worth far more than any lawsuits which might be brought by relatives of the deceased. And the sad thing is, they're probably correct in cash terms.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel victimized by the culture at SII?"}, {"instruction": "No, not victimized. I'm in the same position as everybody else. But sometimes it seems that everybody else is more suited to it than I.", "input": "", "output": "Earlier we were talking about how you felt excluded from promotion by the company's preference for younger employees."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel your current position is threatened too?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I think Taylor would be happy to see me go. In fact I wonder if sending me here is the first step. Maybe he's only given me an illusion of choice. Don't come here and I get fired. Come here and he gathers evidence that I'm incompetent and I get fired.", "input": "", "output": "I've told you before George. Nothing gets back to your boss from me. I don't know him and that would be a clear violation of my obligations as a physician."}, {"instruction": "Yes, but he can point to my sessions with you and imply that I need a psychiatrist.", "input": "", "output": "Indirectly, your company has engaged me to provide mental health services to its staff. Why would it have made that investment if it didn't want these services used?"}, {"instruction": "That's it on one level. But I know what people think.", "input": "", "output": "If you feel you're being discriminated against, I would like to work on finding a positive response."}, {"instruction": "He's going to push me out of this company. We can't afford that. Melissa and I had children late, Doctor, and one of the reasons was so I'd be settled and on a decent income. I didn't expect all this.", "input": "", "output": "George, you're speculating. If Mr. Taylor had wanted to fire you, sending you here would have been a bad move. He would be suggesting that you are ill, and firing an employee purely because of illness would be likely to get the company sued."}, {"instruction": "I'm not ill. I'm really not. It just gets on top of me sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "I'm here to help you, George."}, {"instruction": "I know you mean well. I just don't think you can help.", "input": "", "output": "Have you given some more thought to my suggestion that you keep a journal?"}, {"instruction": "I don't have the time for that, Doctor. I have enough things to do.", "input": "", "output": "Do you ever doodle?"}, {"instruction": "Doodle? Why?", "input": "", "output": "I find it helpful to see doodles from patients. It's not important if you don't."}, {"instruction": "So you can get some deep insight into my subconscious, is that it?", "input": "", "output": "If you're not comfortable with the idea, don't worry about it."}, {"instruction": "If I do any masterpieces I'll save them for your wall, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I would settle for just scribbles. I'm afraid we are out of time for today, George. I would like to prescribe something to help you relax, but I have a feeling you wouldn't take it."}, {"instruction": "Would it see off an interfering boss?", "input": "", "output": "No, it probably wouldn't. Okay, let's see how you get on this week. Your next appointment would be Monday the 10th at 4 pm."}, {"instruction": "That doesn't sound like a very long week.", "input": "", "output": "Would you prefer next Thursday at this time?"}, {"instruction": "How about Monday the 17th?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, that would be fine. At 4 pm then."}, {"instruction": "Have a good week Doctor. Be careful.", "input": "", "output": "Be careful?"}, {"instruction": "I meant take care Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You too George."}, {"instruction": "Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you could reschedule yesterday to today.  I forgot about the President's Day holiday.  How have things been since our last session?"}, {"instruction": "Just the same.", "input": "", "output": "Have you and Mr. Taylor locked horns recently?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not really in the mood to talk about him.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, what would you like to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "I'd sooner not talk about anything. You know I don't want to be here.", "input": "", "output": "Has something in particular happened today?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Then can I ask you about the history of your wrist injury? I notice you're not wearing your brace today."}, {"instruction": "No. I told you, I don't like it.", "input": "", "output": "How was CTS diagnosed?"}, {"instruction": "They said it was probably from using a keyboard and the mouse thing.", "input": "", "output": "Did you consult a doctor through SII?"}, {"instruction": "Yes...uh, no. It was our family physician at the time. Dr Harris. He's since moved away.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have nerve conduction studies done at that time?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I think so. Uh, yes.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of reaction did you get from the company? Mr. Taylor wasn't your boss at that time?"}, {"instruction": "No, it was Tom Windsor. He was very good about it. He had me out and about in the departments a lot more so I wouldn't be using my hands all the time.", "input": "", "output": "And Mr. Taylor hasn't kept this up?"}, {"instruction": "No. He doesn't care if my hands fall off.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about the pain? Does it stop you from relaxing properly?"}, {"instruction": "It's just an irritation, Doctor. There are plenty of irritations in my life.", "input": "", "output": "I take it from your tone that I represent one at this moment."}, {"instruction": "I'm not in the mood for this today.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I can feel your resistance."}, {"instruction": "Why don't you talk for awhile, Doctor? I don't want to come here. You get paid for these sessions while I fall behind in my work. It doesn't seem fair to me. Why don't you talk about your fears and I'll sit here and probe you?", "input": "", "output": "Alright, I have a suggestion to make. Since you are worried about your position being threatened by younger, high-tech graduates, why not go on the offensive?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "Acquire some new skills. Pick an area you feel weak in and be aggressive about learning it."}, {"instruction": "I'm not a very aggressive person, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I mean enthusiastic, really. If you're obviously working hard to stay on the leading edge of technology, Mr. Taylor can hardly justify replacing you on technical grounds."}, {"instruction": "I don't think that would matter very much.", "input": "", "output": "At least it's a positive step to tackle the problem."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to.", "input": "", "output": "Ah. That's different."}, {"instruction": "I get sent on enough training courses as it is.", "input": "", "output": "And you don't enjoy them?"}, {"instruction": "I thought you were supposed to be making me feel better, Doctor. I'm feeling worse and worse.", "input": "", "output": "Would you prefer that we cut our session short today?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I can't answer all these questions. It's too much. I've been working all day. I'm tired.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay. We can try again next week."}, {"instruction": "Don't you ever feel like a parasite, Doctor? Making a living from people's inadequacies. Pressing them for their intimate secrets.", "input": "", "output": "I might if I was seeking entertainment instead of trying to help them.  I'll see you on Monday, February 24th at 2 pm?"}, {"instruction": "Alright.  Goodbye Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye George."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor. I'm sorry about what I said last week before I left. I didn't mean it. I was just tired.", "input": "", "output": "No offense taken."}, {"instruction": "Good.", "input": "", "output": "You still look pretty tired today."}, {"instruction": "I haven't been sleeping well.", "input": "", "output": "Has anything in particular been troubling you?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes the world seems a frightening place, Doctor. You read in the newspaper about killers and disasters and intelligent diseases. If my mind's active at night, it can conjure up all kinds of fears.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have nightmares?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes. Sometimes several in a night.", "input": "", "output": "Can you describe one?"}, {"instruction": "I'm locked in a cold gray room with no windows and no furniture. There's a man being tortured next door. I can hear his shrieks through the wall. I don't know what's being done to him, but it goes on and on. Every time I think it's stopped it starts again and his screams are a little more high-pitched. For some reason, I know what is happening. Whatever is torturing him waits until it has pushed him as hard as it can in one area, then it finds a new part of his body to attack. His teeth, his knees, his ears...I can't see what's going on but I have a picture of knives, drills, electric prods. The worst thing is that I'm next. Whatever's doing it is working its way along the rooms and, once it's finished with my neighbor, it will come to me. And eventually it does stop. And then I hear heavy movements in the corridor and the sound of my door being unlocked. I always wake myself up at that point.", "input": "", "output": "You're able to choose to wake up?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I've been able to do that since I was a boy. When I have a really bad nightmare and something horrible is about to happen, I suddenly understand that I'm dreaming and I wake myself up.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever tried persisting with the dream?"}, {"instruction": "I've thought about that. But I never realize I'm dreaming until I'm terrified, and then I want out so desperately that I leap at the chance.", "input": "", "output": "You said that you know what's happening in the next room. I noticed you said \"it\" and not \"he\" or \"she\". Do you have any idea about what it is that's doing the torturing?"}, {"instruction": "It's not human. But I'm afraid to look at it directly, to see what it is.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think might happen if you did?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It might consume me. I might never wake up.", "input": "", "output": "How often does this nightmare recur?"}, {"instruction": "Not all that often. But I have different nightmares with the same elements.", "input": "", "output": "If your nightmares prevent you from having a restful night, I could prescribe something to help you sleep."}, {"instruction": "No thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Very well, let's turn to something else. Perhaps we could go back to our very first session. Just as you were leaving, you asked me whether I believed in evil. Do you remember?"}, {"instruction": "Of course I remember.", "input": "", "output": "I was wondering why you asked me that question."}, {"instruction": "I wanted to know whether you had an open mind.", "input": "", "output": "And what did you decide?"}, {"instruction": "That you believed in a basically rational world but you were willing to consider other possibilities.", "input": "", "output": "I asked you the same question but you didn't answer at the time."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I believe in evil.", "input": "", "output": "How would you define it?"}, {"instruction": "A black smothering force which is all around us.", "input": "", "output": "Can you see it?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Can you give me an example?"}, {"instruction": "I was at a seminar on our financial strategy. The room was dark. The face of the man giving the talk was lit from beneath by the overhead projector. Light escaped from slits in the metal body. I looked at the projector's black shape with the light inside and I was overwhelmed with a feeling of malevolence lurking inside it. The presenter carried on, he didn't notice anything. The back of my shirt was soaked with cold sweat.", "input": "", "output": "What happened when he finished?"}, {"instruction": "He turned the projector off and raised the lights. It felt safer with the room bright and the projector light off, but still not completely safe. I could feel that it was still there; it was just sleeping.", "input": "", "output": "You defined evil earlier as a black smothering force, but you seem very clear that it was contained in the light of the projector."}, {"instruction": "Not contained exactly. And it wasn't the light itself. That was just...its emanations. I didn't see any definite form to the evil. Excuse me, what have I been saying?", "input": "", "output": "We have been talking about evil and how you see it."}, {"instruction": "Have I been talking nonsense?", "input": "", "output": "On the contrary, what you've told me is very valuable."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I feel uneasy about this. Can we talk about something else?", "input": "", "output": "Okay. You said before that you saw formal procedures and rules as the disease of our time, devaluing contact between people."}, {"instruction": "That wasn't exactly what I said. I meant the attitude that promotes them.", "input": "", "output": "The attitude that these rules are more important than getting the job done?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Before today, I wondered if you regarded that attitude as evil."}, {"instruction": "No. It's just misguided. Perhaps it's a symptom of evil.", "input": "", "output": "Would you say that I come into contact with evil on a regular basis?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "In what form?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think I want to talk about this any more.", "input": "", "output": "I really would like to know."}, {"instruction": "If you can't see it then it probably can't harm you.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say that?"}, {"instruction": "Please Doctor. Let's talk about something else.", "input": "", "output": "Alright. I'm sorry if I'm pushing you too hard."}, {"instruction": "You're only trying to help.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you feel that way."}, {"instruction": "There are people who make their emotions very public, Doctor. I think some of them do it for show. I'm not like that. I'm a very private person. Sitting here, talking to you about myself, it makes me feel very uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "Many patients find that, especially in the beginning. I appreciate that you keep coming back here to a situation which you find difficult."}, {"instruction": "I think you are good at your job, Doctor. I imagined you as a much more fearsome character. I was quite worked up before our first session.", "input": "", "output": "I remember."}, {"instruction": "I didn't know what you were going to do. Doctors and doctors' offices are frightening places. But all we do is sit and talk. It feels old-fashioned.", "input": "", "output": "Now that I don't have my computer around?"}, {"instruction": "You don't need one. You would be just as good with paper files. Maybe one day your computer will break and you will lose all your careful notes.", "input": "", "output": "I do make backups."}, {"instruction": "Looks like our time is up.", "input": "", "output": "Yes it is. Before you go, did I let you know you can call me at any time? You have the number."}, {"instruction": "That's good of you Doctor. I don't think it's likely but I will keep it in mind.", "input": "", "output": "As you wish. I'll see you next Monday at the same time?"}, {"instruction": "Yes Doctor. Have a good week.", "input": "", "output": "You too George."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I would like to lead the course of our session today if you'll allow me."}, {"instruction": "That's fine.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. This is our sixth session together. How do you feel we're getting along?"}, {"instruction": "I think I trust you.", "input": "", "output": "Good. What has made you feel comfortable about talking to me?"}, {"instruction": "Your manner, I suppose. You're ready to take me for what I am. You don't have any private agenda that you want me to follow. I'm not used to being the center of attention like this, but it's getting easier.", "input": "", "output": "I'm pleased to hear that. During earlier sessions, you were very clear that you didn't want to be here. Do you still feel that way?"}, {"instruction": "Not so much recently. To be honest, coming here can be a bit of a relief after an intense day in the office. Now that I don't feel like a laboratory specimen being studied.", "input": "", "output": "So Mr. Taylor isn't compelling you to be here any longer?"}, {"instruction": "I'm happy to keep coming to see you if that's what you mean.", "input": "", "output": "I was wondering about your relationship with him and thinking back over our sessions. I've had an idea. I could write a letter to Mr. Taylor stating that you're perfectly healthy and that you shouldn't be in therapy. I could copy it to the personnel department. That should get you out of coming to our sessions for good. How would you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, well...", "input": "", "output": "You're quite clear in your own mind that there's nothing wrong. Why should I waste your time looking for problems where there are none to be found?"}, {"instruction": "You're not wasting my time.", "input": "", "output": "Oh. So you think we should continue with our sessions?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure you know best.", "input": "", "output": "Right. Well, I'll start on this letter and from next week you'll be a free man. In fact, you should have time to go back to your department today if you want. You could get another half hour..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want to stop our sessions. I'm finding them very useful.", "input": "", "output": "Really? Tell me more."}, {"instruction": "I'm not used to talking about myself. I can talk to Melissa, but there's some things I can't even tell her. She wouldn't understand. I'm just beginning to feel okay about talking to you. Please don't stop our sessions now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear we've made progress, George. But there are other issues here. I have to justify retaining patients on a long-term basis. I can't continue our meetings indefinitely just because..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I'm terrified...", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, George. Let it come. Let it out. I won't stop our sessions. Take your time."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Here. Have a tissue."}, {"instruction": "I haven't cried for years.", "input": "", "output": "You might be surprised how many people haven't. Tears are an emotional safety valve, George. It's not good for us to block them up."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry. I don't find it easy to talk about myself.", "input": "", "output": "Many people don't. I would rather we took things at a pace you were happy with."}, {"instruction": "What were we talking about?", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I wanted to explore these bouts of sickness you've been having."}, {"instruction": "What about them?", "input": "", "output": "It seems quite a coincidence that you should have two on the first Mondays of consecutive months. George?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I suppose it is a coincidence. I hadn't realized that.", "input": "", "output": "Has it happened before?"}, {"instruction": "Um...", "input": "", "output": "On, say, the 7th of October, the 4th of November, the 2nd of December and January the 6th?"}, {"instruction": "Ah.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to tell me about these training sessions?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure Taylor thinks I've been pretending to be sick. I haven't. I've been genuinely sick. Perhaps I've exaggerated a little, but that's all.", "input": "", "output": "You sounded bad both times you rang to cancel our session."}, {"instruction": "I probably sound like that all the time on the telephone. I don't like using it.", "input": "", "output": "Specifically what is it about using the telephone that you dislike?"}, {"instruction": "Perhaps it would be easier if I told you about the training session.", "input": "", "output": "Please do."}, {"instruction": "Around September last year, Administration got a new computer system. I think that was one of the reasons they hired Taylor, he knew all about that kind of thing. Everyone was so enthusiastic about how it would make our life so much easier. It would keep track of everything and warn us when we had to contact people and so on. We were all to be trained to use it--a company across town gives a course. On the first morning of the course, I was dreadfully ill. I sat on the bathroom floor, curled up with the worst stomach cramps I ever had. I was sick all over the room.", "input": "", "output": "So you didn't go to the course?"}, {"instruction": "No. And then the next month, the course was on again. It happened again, just as bad.", "input": "", "output": "And it's been happening every month since?"}, {"instruction": "That's right. You only noticed because our sessions are on Mondays.", "input": "", "output": "So your department has been doing everything through this new computer system for nearly six months, and you don't know how to operate it?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. That's right.", "input": "", "output": "I guess that irritates Mr. Taylor."}, {"instruction": "Yes. It's hardly my fault though. I can barely move on those mornings.", "input": "", "output": "When do the cramps go away?"}, {"instruction": "Usually around nine-thirty. Actually it varies. Once I realize that it's too late to go to the course, I find myself loosening up. I'm normally all right again by lunchtime.", "input": "", "output": "How does your family react?"}, {"instruction": "The children are normally on their way to school before it really hits. Melissa is very concerned; she always wants to get a doctor. But now I've learned to just wait it out.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about the course on the night before?"}, {"instruction": "Anxious. I often have trouble getting to sleep.", "input": "", "output": "What about the week beforehand?"}, {"instruction": "I try to forget that the course is coming up. But obviously that doesn't work very well.", "input": "", "output": "Burying your feelings seldom does. You manage three staff members, don't you?"}, {"instruction": "That's right.", "input": "", "output": "How is your relationship with them affected by this new computer system, and the fact you can't use it yet?"}, {"instruction": "I get round it mostly. I ask them questions directly rather than consult the records myself. I get them to print reports out for me. I suppose I've gotten quite good at avoiding the problem.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds to me like you are avoiding the problem in several different ways."}, {"instruction": "Yes. You're allowed to be eccentric when you're a little older and you're managing staff. They like to feel you're an old fuddy-duddy. They're probably right. It lets me get away with things. Not everything though. I think they're beginning to wonder.", "input": "", "output": "And Mr. Taylor won't let it lie?"}, {"instruction": "That's different because he's my manager. He gets to make demands about how I work.", "input": "", "output": "We need to explore this in more detail, George. Unfortunately, we can't fit that in today. I really hope we can be candid from the beginning next session."}, {"instruction": "I don't seem to have been able to avoid the issue today. But you haven't heard everything yet.", "input": "", "output": "Can we make a start on it next Monday, same time?"}, {"instruction": "Yes Doctor. I promise.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week then, George."}, {"instruction": "Good afternoon, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good afternoon, George. Thank you for calling in last week. I enjoyed talking to Melissa. She sounds very fond of you."}, {"instruction": "She is. That's one thing I have got right, Doctor. We're a close family.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that."}, {"instruction": "Melissa thought it was funny that you called her \"Ms.\"", "input": "", "output": "Funny amusing or funny strange?"}, {"instruction": "Amusing. She's used to being called Mrs. Landau. I think she rather enjoyed the novelty of it. I remember when I was a child, I enjoyed getting letters addressed to \"Mr. G. Landau\". It made me feel very grown-up.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel grown-up these days?"}, {"instruction": "Ah yes. When we had the children, I came down to their level for a while, but now they're getting to the age where they want to be adults. It's a shame, isn't it? If you could view your life as a whole, you would hang on to childhood for every last minute.", "input": "", "output": "I think that's often true. But I also believe that as adults we often romanticize our childhoods."}, {"instruction": "Hmm, perhaps you're right. I wouldn't like to go to school again. You never really escape though, do you? I'm fifty-two now and I've still got someone telling me what to do.", "input": "", "output": "Our friend Mr. Taylor."}, {"instruction": "Oh, let's not start that again.", "input": "", "output": "Last week, we were talking about those training courses. The ones which make you ill."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Can you describe for me how you visualize the course? I mean, what the room will be like, what people will be there, and so forth."}, {"instruction": "I imagine a small room with space for a teacher and six students. We are all cramped and pushed together. The blinds are drawn.", "input": "", "output": "Will you each have a computer?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. The room will be stuffy and hot from the black blinds and the horrible machines.", "input": "", "output": "I beg your pardon?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I mean the computers. They will all heat up until the room is stifling. There will be nothing to drink in order to protect the computers.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you say \"the horrible machines?\""}, {"instruction": "I wasn't thinking. The teacher is a man or maybe a girl, much younger than me. Yes, perhaps a girl, with a business suit and a practiced presentation manner. She uses jargon without explaining what she means. Every five minutes she asks if everyone has understood. The first couple of times I raise a hand and she explains again, more slowly, but I still don't get it. Quite soon I stop interrupting and pretend I understand everything.", "input": "", "output": "That's a very vivid picture of your fears."}, {"instruction": "It gets worse. They have a practical session after an hour or so, when each of us turns to a computer and has to work on what we've learned. The tutor comes around to see how we're doing and I'm still sitting there, trying not to look at the blank screen. She offers quiet suggestions, but her tone changes as she realizes I haven't taken in a word. The other students are young whiz kids, flying through the exercises, their fingers chattering on the keys. The tutor tries to help me with the very basics. She is very polite on the surface, but it's obvious from her voice that she thinks I'm a stupid old man, and the others look over at me. Possibly I faint...Doctor, I feel like crying again.", "input": "", "output": "That's understandable, George. Look.  We're working with powerful images here. But this kind of visualization is necessary for us to fight your terrors. Fears are stronger if you don't confront them."}, {"instruction": "At the agency, they'll know I'm the one who keeps not turning up. They'll all ready have noticed. I'll be a curiosity before we even start. And what if one of the juniors in my department is there too?", "input": "", "output": "Okay, there are three things we have to remember. First, you're not a stupid old man. You're a talented manager who has been good at his job for years and excels at dealing with people. Second, operating computer systems is not a matter of common sense. It's a very specialized skill which becomes easier to pick up with previous experience. It doesn't sound like you've had any experience with computers before, whereas your younger staff probably grew up with them as teddy bears."}, {"instruction": "What's the third thing?", "input": "", "output": "Third, this training course is not the only way you can learn to use the administration computers. You are a senior employee and you can expect a reasonable amount of accommodation. You could ask for a relaxed, one-on-one session tailored to your needs. I'm sure Mr. Taylor would be delighted to make special arrangements if it meant you picked up the necessary skills."}, {"instruction": "That sounds fair.", "input": "", "output": "You don't sound quite convinced."}, {"instruction": "It's not quite that simple.", "input": "", "output": "What other complication is there?"}, {"instruction": "I'm scared of the machines.", "input": "", "output": "The computers?"}, {"instruction": "It's not just the embarrassment of being last in the class. It's not just about feeling old and out of date. The machines, the wires, the sound they make...they are like an ordeal that I can't escape.  My life keeps dragging me back to them.", "input": "", "output": "Can you describe the feeling to me?"}, {"instruction": "Imagine you were trapped at the back of a cave with a hungry lion just sitting there, staring at you. That's the way I feel about my computer. I plug it in sometimes for show, so it looks as if I've been working with it. But then it distracts me and I can't concentrate. I never feel comfortable in my office any more. Things are a little easier when it's not plugged in. But I keep expecting it to come on by itself even then.", "input": "", "output": "That was why my laptop made you uncomfortable."}, {"instruction": "Your computer, Taylor's computer, the elevator panel, the telephone every time I call you...", "input": "", "output": "So it's not just computers which make you feel this way?"}, {"instruction": "Oh no. The world is filling up with things which do.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I'd like to understand exactly what frightens you. How about if I name some objects and you tell me how you feel about them?"}, {"instruction": "Certainly, if it will help.", "input": "", "output": "An electric kettle."}, {"instruction": "They make me shudder. Who knows what they're doing inside?", "input": "", "output": "An old tin kettle, to use on a stove."}, {"instruction": "I feel fine about that.", "input": "", "output": "An aluminum can for a soft drink."}, {"instruction": "Fine.", "input": "", "output": "A computer printer."}, {"instruction": "Terrifying. It lets them move objects in the real world.", "input": "", "output": "A washing machine."}, {"instruction": "Awful. I imagine a small animal trapped in there, peering out, as the machine switches itself on, trying to make its victim dizzy before drowning it.", "input": "", "output": "A gas station pump."}, {"instruction": "Makes me a little uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "A network."}, {"instruction": "What, you mean of people?", "input": "", "output": "No, the wires which connect computers together."}, {"instruction": "Awful. They can talk to each other without us hearing.", "input": "", "output": "An electric light."}, {"instruction": "Quite uncomfortable. Actually I've just had a nightmare which involved an electric light.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "It seemed to be on a space station or in the future somehow. Melissa and the children were there. We had been having a nice time, although I don't know what we had been doing. I stepped through a doorway and a glass panel slid down behind me to cover it. It was just a small cupboard with high-tech devices all over the walls. It was red. I turned and tried to open the door. My family stared at me. I pushed my fingers up against the glass. There was a light bulb above the doorway on either side. The bulb inside came on and there was a hum. Melissa looked sad. I asked her to open the door and she said she couldn't. She said I had been exposed to...something. Dexter sinister...something which sounded like that. Slowly she said goodbye and led the children away. She said I would never be able to go near them again.", "input": "", "output": "Sinister and dexter are the Latin words for left and right."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I don't think those were the actual words. I can't remember them clearly.", "input": "", "output": "We've covered a lot in this session. But I'm afraid we are out of time."}, {"instruction": "I feel a little weak. I think I might go to the park for a walk.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like a good idea. You are making great progress, George, and I know how difficult it must be. The next training course will be in two weeks, is that correct?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Next week I want to work out a strategy for dealing with it, and build on what you've told me today."}, {"instruction": "All right, Doctor. I'll give it a try.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that, George. Enjoy your walk, and look after yourself this week."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor. You too.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, George."}, {"instruction": "That's okay, Doctor.  Thanks for seeing me now.", "input": "", "output": "Well, your next training session is this coming Monday.  I was hoping to have a chance to work with you before then."}, {"instruction": "It feels strange coming in here with all my cards on the table already, as it were.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you feel you have done?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Like I have owned up to something.", "input": "", "output": "To me or to yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Both, I think.", "input": "", "output": "How does that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Strong, actually. I feel less vulnerable. That's very strange. I would have expected to feel more vulnerable.", "input": "", "output": "Admitting fears is the first step towards dealing with them. And by doing so, you are taking control of your own future in a way you were avoiding previously. You are empowering yourself; it's not strange that you should feel stronger."}, {"instruction": "Do you think I will see a change next Monday morning? Perhaps I won't get sick?", "input": "", "output": "It's possible that you will feel differently. But I don't want you to expect the problem to suddenly go away."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I feel like I could perhaps tackle the training session next week. It surely can't be as bad as I imagined.", "input": "", "output": "I would like to explore this today."}, {"instruction": "Surely the only way to really tell what I will feel is to go along?", "input": "", "output": "Slow down, George. I'm happy for you to try this training course once again if you feel positive about it. But you have been telling me about some pretty strong feelings and I don't think we have dealt with them yet."}, {"instruction": "I thought you would be pleased I felt this way, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I am pleased with your progress, George. I just don't want you to rush things. I was going to suggest that you might cancel the training session next week in order to give yourself time to deal with it."}, {"instruction": "But I don't need time, Doctor. That's the worst thing I could have. A few weeks would only make the course seem more frightening. It would be a horrible experience coming up on my calendar, always there in the future. Better that I go straight ahead without thinking too hard. Like jumping into a cold lake.", "input": "", "output": "Jumping into a cold lake is not always a wise move."}, {"instruction": "I came in here feeling quite enthusiastic, Doctor, and now I feel defeated.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, that wasn't my intention. I would like us to explore your feelings about computers in a little more depth."}, {"instruction": "How would you like us to do that?", "input": "", "output": "Please don't take that tone, George."}, {"instruction": "Well, I feel like I have taken control of myself for the first time in years, and you want me to go back to the way it was before.", "input": "", "output": "That's not the case. I am pleased for you to go ahead next week and tackle the course on your own terms. But since you are here today, why don't we talk about the specifics anyway?"}, {"instruction": "Because if I think too hard about what the course will involve then I will find it much more difficult to face my fear.", "input": "", "output": "I would rather you faced it slowly in a controlled environment than jumped straight in during an unfamiliar social situation."}, {"instruction": "I just feel that if I'm bold about it, if I move quickly and don't think too hard beforehand, I may break through the barrier.", "input": "", "output": "I don't want you to hurt yourself, George."}, {"instruction": "If I'm going to be hurt at all, I would rather get it over quickly rather than suffer slowly over several months.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Let's stop for a moment and remind ourselves what we are talking about. You have a training course scheduled next week concerning your departmental computer system. It is with a group of strangers across town. We've established that you have a phobia relating to computers which..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, that's it, is it?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Never mind how many weeks we've spent here talking about me. Never mind all the personal things I've spilled out. Now you've found a label you can stick on me. I hope it makes you happy.", "input": "", "output": "George, I thought we had come beyond this kind of thing."}, {"instruction": "Why don't we just stop the session now?", "input": "", "output": "Are you talking about leaving therapy for good?"}, {"instruction": "If my plan works I won't need therapy anymore, will I? But don't worry, I'll come back for a last session so you can look me over and slap a \"cured\" sticker on my file.", "input": "", "output": "And if your plan doesn't work?"}, {"instruction": "I can't think about that or I'll be beaten before I start.", "input": "", "output": "I don't want to get in your way, George. Perhaps you are right. Only please think hard before you decide to stop coming here. You have made progress, but we have really only touched the surface of what is bothering you."}, {"instruction": "You have been good for me, Doctor. I do lash out at you, I'm sorry about that.", "input": "", "output": "I'm used to it."}, {"instruction": "I want to go now. I don't want to explain any more or talk about this at all. I just have to get on and do it.", "input": "", "output": "But George, if it doesn't work out, don't think all is lost.  We can work on this problem together."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to be undermined.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I guess we won't be having a session next Monday. Tell you what, why don't you call me and tell me how the course went? If you've survived exposure to computers all day a five-minute phone call should be relatively painless."}, {"instruction": "I don't know when it finishes...but yes, I'll do that.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I hope it goes all right."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor. How are you today?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, George. I'm fine, thanks. You seem relaxed. Has a week away from me done you some good?"}, {"instruction": "Relaxed...I don't know if that's the right word. But I do feel different. Resigned, perhaps. Or focused maybe.", "input": "", "output": "Is that due to your experience two Mondays past?"}, {"instruction": "Was throwing up on the sidewalk a pivotal experience for me, do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "I was thinking more of..."}, {"instruction": "I know. Acknowledging my fears but then confronting them without preparation. I've had some time to consider it, Doctor. Don't worry. I might be a stupid old man, but I'm not stupid.", "input": "", "output": "I thought we had agreed before that you weren't a stupid old man."}, {"instruction": "It's strange, actually. If I had been sick in the street four months ago, I would have been hideously embarrassed. I would have been worried about being taken for a drunk. But now...I leaned against a garbage can and felt something as I watched people pass by. It was almost pride. Not quite, but almost. I suppose I felt virtuous because nobody stopped to see if I was all right, and if the situation were reversed, I would have stopped. Do you see what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "I think so. You felt that you had more compassion?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. How else can I put it? I was thinking: This is me. I'm not some disgusting drunk. I have a problem which I am trying to deal with, and it has caused me to be sick in the street. I don't deserve your contempt. Not one of you cares enough about your fellow man to stop and see if I need help. I actually felt good about the situation after the shakes had worn off.", "input": "", "output": "I think that's positive, George. I'm pleased you feel that way. Some kind of phobia affects seven out of every hundred Americans. It's really nothing to feel ashamed of."}, {"instruction": "I'm not quite ready to proclaim it to my staff yet.", "input": "", "output": "That's different. There is another issue there because you manage these people and you have to retain their respect. But we will get to that. Our immediate priority is to prepare you for your next training session."}, {"instruction": "There isn't going to be another. Not for some time at least.", "input": "", "output": "Have the company stopped offering the course?"}, {"instruction": "No, I've taken myself off the list until you and I are both sure I can deal with it.", "input": "", "output": "I think that's a very sensible move. Then I suppose our short-term concern is how to deal with Mr. Taylor. He won't be pleased to hear that you have signed off the course."}, {"instruction": "He didn't mind after I explained the whole thing.", "input": "", "output": "You told him?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I waited until he wasn't busy and then talked to him in his office. He was pretty reasonable once I had laid the whole thing out and told him that you and I were going to work to get me over it.", "input": "", "output": "This is Simon Taylor, your boss, we are talking about here?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "George, I am floored. You've approached this in the most positive way I could imagine. If your boss is behind you and we don't have an imminent deadline, we can really take the treatment at the pace which you find comfortable."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "There is one thing which has been puzzling me."}, {"instruction": "What's that?", "input": "", "output": "Your carpal tunnel syndrome. You haven't been wearing your wrist brace for a while."}, {"instruction": "No...", "input": "", "output": "And you told me that when it was diagnosed, the doctor said it was probably brought on by using a computer keyboard and mouse. But you haven't been using a computer keyboard or mouse much..."}, {"instruction": "This bit I do feel ashamed about.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me."}, {"instruction": "I didn't have wrist problems diagnosed. That period is a little unclear in my memory. At the time I did feel pain in my wrist. At least, I think I did. I had read about repetitive strain injury and how firms had to look after their workers. I suppose it had stuck in my head.", "input": "", "output": "Are you saying you don't have CTS? I was surprised it's not mentioned in your personnel file."}, {"instruction": "I believed in some way that I did. It was all very vague. I didn't set out to deceive anybody. I just told myself that I didn't need to go to the doctor. I had a pain in my wrist and I knew what it was. I knew how to deal with it. I have a friend who works in a hospital. He was able to get me the brace...I told myself I was saving the doctor's time. Looking back, I suppose, I was trying to convince myself.", "input": "", "output": "So you started wearing the wrist brace to work?"}, {"instruction": "I thought I needed to. Maybe on one level I knew I was deceiving myself. I mean, I knew I had hardly touched the keyboard or the mouse thing, but still I believed my wrist had been damaged by them. I was convinced enough to bring it off at work anyway.", "input": "", "output": "To bring off the charade?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I suppose it was a charade. I didn't think of it as such though. I still don't, really. I was deluding myself, but I was also the one being deluded. So I'm innocent as well as guilty. Does that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I think it is important that you acknowledge that you were deluding yourself."}, {"instruction": "I was. I think I was.", "input": "", "output": "What effect did the wrist brace have at work?"}, {"instruction": "People showed a lot of concern. It was very noticeable, particularly when I had my jacket off. Tom Windsor was very good about it for a while.", "input": "", "output": "He was your superior before Mr. Taylor arrived?"}, {"instruction": "That's right. You have a good memory, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Plus extensive notes. But you said he was good about it for a while. Did that change?"}, {"instruction": "I think by the end he was becoming suspicious. He would look at the brace strangely when we talked. He was too nice a man to be a manager really. It would have upset him to confront me about it. As it happened, he left before matters came to a head.", "input": "", "output": "What other effects did the brace have on your work?"}, {"instruction": "It was very handy when people came to see me in my office and we had to look something up on the computer. It would have been more natural for me to drive the thing. But I could squeeze my arm as if it hurt and naturally my visitor would offer to drive the computer for me. I think my arm often did hurt in those situations.", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned several times today that you felt pain although you didn't suffer from CTS."}, {"instruction": "Yes. That's quite frightening, now that I think about it. I think I perhaps wandered out on occasion.", "input": "", "output": "Wandered out?"}, {"instruction": "I wasn't quite myself. I was seeing things in strange ways. Part of the delusion maybe.", "input": "", "output": "Can you tell me more about this?"}, {"instruction": "It was just a frame of mind. My brain tried to tell itself to believe something which another part knew wasn't true, so it had to move out a little to resolve the picture. To change the perspective. I don't want to make a big deal out of it. It just happened. I think I've exaggerated it today. This self-analysis is heady stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Well, let me bring you back to Earth and tell you about the treatment I want to try."}, {"instruction": "Please do.", "input": "", "output": "There is a technique called \"flooding.\" It involves you experiencing imaginary situations which confront your fear. However all the time you will be in the safe environment of my office."}, {"instruction": "You make it sound easy. But I imagine it is distinctly unpleasant.", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid it is. But it's a very effective treatment."}, {"instruction": "The idea is that after I have experienced the worst in my imagination, the real thing won't be half as bad?", "input": "", "output": "It is a little more subtle than that. But you have grasped the broad principle."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I don't suppose there is an equally effective treatment which is relaxing and pleasant?", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid not."}, {"instruction": "No. Well, I suppose I can be brave for a while longer.", "input": "", "output": "I think you are a brave man, George. Particularly in light of what you told me earlier."}, {"instruction": "If I was truly brave, I would have dealt with it years ago. No, let's do it. But let's have one session every two weeks. I found the extra time to think very valuable.", "input": "", "output": "It certainly worked this session. All right then, George, then I'll see you next on Monday, May the 5th, at 4 pm."}, {"instruction": "I'll be there. I'll try to be ready.", "input": "", "output": "I'm very pleased with your progress, George."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doctor. Tell me that again after we've done this flood stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Flooding. Okay, George, it's a deal."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, George."}, {"instruction": "Oh. Okay, I suppose. This last week has been a little rough.", "input": "", "output": "What has been happening?"}, {"instruction": "One of Melissa's friends is in hospital. It looks like cancer of the prostate. Melissa is really not herself at the moment. And I've been having more nightmares. They've gotten worse in the last two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Do you find it difficult to get a full night's sleep?"}, {"instruction": "It seems that every hour either I wake Melissa by shouting or flinching suddenly, or she wakes me by tossing and turning. It wears both of us down--you can imagine it.", "input": "", "output": "How has this affected your relationship?"}, {"instruction": "I would have jumped down your throat for that question a few months ago, wouldn't I? Told you to mind your own business.", "input": "", "output": "I can visualize that happening. Do you feel differently now?"}, {"instruction": "Melissa can be a little short with me. Perhaps I try to help her in the kitchen and just get in her way. She can snap at me without meaning to. But she usually notices when she does it, and she'll make it up to me later. We've been through a lot together, Doctor. We know how things change when one of us is under a strain. We can handle it.", "input": "", "output": "You must be tired at work, too."}, {"instruction": "Yes. It's a bit easier now that Taylor knows about my problem with computers. But he's not going to stay patient forever.", "input": "", "output": "I hope we can make you feel better long before that."}, {"instruction": "That would be good. Although I'm not in peak condition today for a white-knuckled hell ride through my subconscious.", "input": "", "output": "We don't have to start with the rickety big dipper. We can take it more slowly than that.  I thought we'd just explore in detail some of your antipathy towards machines."}, {"instruction": "Big Dipper.  That's in Santa Cruz, right?  Now you're making me think of the ghost train.", "input": "", "output": "The ghost train?"}, {"instruction": "Any ghost train. You must have been on one, Doctor, at a county fair or an amusement park? You sit in a little carriage and drive slowly through dark tunnels. Skeletons and ghosts loom out at you. Bats swing over your head. Cobwebs brush past your face. Then your two bucks are spent and a grouchy man kicks you out of your car.", "input": "", "output": "I know the rides you mean. It sounds like you have a very cynical view of them."}, {"instruction": "Does it? Far from it, they used to terrify me. I hate all that kind of thing. I had a girl once--Faith was her name--who used to drag me to the boardwalk in Santa Cruz and onto that ride. She loved them, she would come out the other end bouncing in her seat, her face shining. I was more likely to be hunched down with my jacket over my head to stop anything from touching my skin.", "input": "", "output": "I hope she paid."}, {"instruction": "I paid. In the end she dumped me, but I was quite pleased.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever taken your children on one of these rides?"}, {"instruction": "What? Oh no. If they want to suffer they can do it by themselves. Elizabeth would probably enjoy them. I imagine Daniel would think they were a bit of a waste of time.", "input": "", "output": "I want to talk about your fear of computers now."}, {"instruction": "It's funny...I suppose I can see it earlier in my life when I look for it. The ghost train is one example--I don't particularly like unknown things brushing my face in the dark. But that wasn't the most scary thing about the ride.", "input": "", "output": "Please go on."}, {"instruction": "If you knew a man in a vampire costume was going to jump out at you, it would surprise you when it happened, but it wouldn't be terrifying. The thing is, the ghost train is like some giant machine which opens its doors and swallows you up. And when you are inside, all the moving parts are controlled by the machine. It's dark so you can't see what's coming. The machine could do anything to you. It could make a bar move out and knock your head off. Do you see what I'm trying to describe?", "input": "", "output": "I think so. But I'd like to hear more."}, {"instruction": "You can't tell what they're thinking because they have no face. They show you a screen, or a novelty ride, but you just don't know what's going on underneath. You don't know what's in the wires.", "input": "", "output": "If you talked to the computer engineers--and you can find them at SII--they'd explain to you how a computer worked, right down to the electricity running along each connection inside. Some of them have a total understanding of how the machine works at every level. They would be skeptical about any idea that the computer thought for itself."}, {"instruction": "Scientists. Scientists are always wrong, Doctor. All the way through history, scientists have been convinced that they understood how the world worked, and then some revolution came along and showed that they had misunderstood. Why should we be right today when we haven't been before?", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's partly true. But..."}, {"instruction": "And we can only look at things from a human perspective. We have a rigid definition of what life is. What if we have created a new form of life, and it is sitting there calmly appraising us? It may have capabilities we can't conceive of.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure I have read science fiction stories to that effect."}, {"instruction": "There are very few rooms in the SII building which don't have at least one computer screen in them. They can see everything. They know more than we do. They can communicate faster than we can think.", "input": "", "output": "Do you believe what you are telling me, George?"}, {"instruction": "Believe...I don't know. Nobody knows for sure. But this is what I feel, Doctor. I feel watched. I feel assessed. My body is so fragile. One electric shock and I am gone.", "input": "", "output": "This is what you feel when you sit down in front of your office computer?"}, {"instruction": "No, I feel it most of the time. In the street, automatic cameras are watching. Televisions look out from the appliance stores. Computer screens flicker behind the blinds of office buildings.", "input": "", "output": "You sound distant, George."}, {"instruction": "I feel cold.", "input": "", "output": "What do you feel when you have to sit down and confront the computer on your desk?"}, {"instruction": "Some days, it's a sheer wave of fear. My hair stands on end, my skin goose-pimples, I can't breathe, I can't move. When I'm more lucid, I sometimes feel like I'm completely open to the machine. It can read every pore on my skin.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel threatened?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. But more than that. I can feel...known. Like it can read what I'm thinking. It's not so ridiculous, Doctor. Our body works by electrical impulses. Why shouldn't they be able to read those?", "input": "", "output": "I sense you feel awkward about referring to computers as living things."}, {"instruction": "Of course. I sound crazy. I know that. But it's how I feel.", "input": "", "output": "I appreciate you being so open about it. And I think we should these feelings more."}, {"instruction": "Don't put too much store in exactly what I'm saying. I'm trying to understand myself. I'm grasping for the right words to describe my feelings and it's not something at which I have much practice. I may be going too far and saying things I don't really mean.", "input": "", "output": "I'll watch out for that. But you're doing very well articulating your feelings, which is always difficult even when there's not so much attached to them."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Next week I'd like to begin the flooding technique, okay?"}, {"instruction": "In two weeks, please. I'd like to settle on this as a regular schedule.", "input": "", "output": "Can I rely on no abrupt illnesses breaking our sessions up even further?"}, {"instruction": "No you can't, Doctor. I don't choose to make myself ill. But if I have no training course to go to, I don't see why it should happen. We are working on this, yes?", "input": "", "output": "Okay, George. I didn't mean to suggest you would stay away voluntarily. But the flooding can be quite an intense process."}, {"instruction": "I'm prepared. I think I'm prepared.", "input": "", "output": "I will see you at 4 pm then, on Monday the 19th of May."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor. Stay away from the fairgrounds.", "input": "", "output": "I will if I see one. Bye, George."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor. How are you today?", "input": "", "output": "I'm fine, George. Yourself?"}, {"instruction": "I'm still not sleeping as well as I might. But it's been a good week with the children. There was a parents' evening at Elizabeth's school. Melissa and I went up to hear about...", "input": "", "output": "George."}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "We have to start the flooding treatment today. It will take most of our time."}, {"instruction": "You don't want to hear about the parents' evening?", "input": "", "output": "I'd be happy to later. But I really must insist that we press on with this. I know you're not looking forward to it, but you can't put it off indefinitely."}, {"instruction": "I suppose you're right. Do you want me to lie down or something?", "input": "", "output": "The chair you are in will be fine--anywhere you can concentrate on what we are doing."}, {"instruction": "I remember I thought you were going to demand I lie down during our first session. It's really a very nice couch. My...", "input": "", "output": "George."}, {"instruction": "I know. I know. Okay, how do we start?", "input": "", "output": "Close your eyes."}, {"instruction": "Don't you want me to take off my shoes first, to get comfortable?", "input": "", "output": "Just close your eyes, George."}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. How do you get to work from home?"}, {"instruction": "I walk.", "input": "", "output": "You took a cab to your training course recently. Imagine yourself back inside it. Where are you sitting?"}, {"instruction": "The back seat. I can see the upholstery. It's old leather and it's ripped.", "input": "", "output": "Concentrate on the car itself. Can you hear the engine?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "You're inside its metal frame. Think about the mechanics of the drive system, hidden from view in the body."}, {"instruction": "It's all a bit abstract. I don't know much about how cars work.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about being contained in the car?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. The driver seems to know what he is doing.", "input": "", "output": "Keep your eyes closed. The cab stops and you get out. You pay the driver and step inside a skyscraper."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Your training course is on the sixteenth floor. You step into the elevator. You are alone. How do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "A little uneasy.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "The lift is such a complicated device. It has a small control panel. We shouldn't trust it. It closes the doors by itself and sometimes it doesn't go where you tell it.", "input": "", "output": "You press the button for floor number sixteen. The doors close."}, {"instruction": "Now I feel very nervous. I stand in a corner of the lift. I don't really want to watch the control panel but I know I should.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say you should?"}, {"instruction": "To find out what's going on. Although...I don't know that the panel is telling the truth.", "input": "", "output": "The elevator moves off. You feel yourself get heavy for a moment as it accelerates. The control panel counts the levels fast from 1 to 16."}, {"instruction": "I'm just waiting for it to be over.", "input": "", "output": "What do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Out of control. There's nothing I can do. I just have to hope it takes me up and lets me walk out. It could drop me down the shaft or into the furnace. All I can do is cower in the corner and wait.", "input": "", "output": "You feel lighter for a moment and the elevator arrives. The doors open."}, {"instruction": "I scuttle out quickly. I half expect the doors to slam shut on me as I pass through.", "input": "", "output": "You have just shivered. Why?"}, {"instruction": "It's the relief. It can't get me now that I'm outside it.", "input": "", "output": "What do you feel standing there in the corridor?"}, {"instruction": "I feel as if there is a cliff edge behind me. I want to get away from it so I won't fall over by mistake.", "input": "", "output": "Can you feel the elevator still there?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Is it looking at you?"}, {"instruction": "Not looking exactly. But it's watching me somehow. I want to walk away from it.", "input": "", "output": "You begin to walk down the corridor. A sign directs you to room 1620 for the training course. From the numbers on the doors beside you, you guess room 1620 is just round the next corner. How do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Dreadful. I want to find the stairs and get out.", "input": "", "output": "Concentrate on what you are feeling. You walk towards the corner."}, {"instruction": "My head feels faint. I seem to be unsteady on my feet. My stomach is bubbling.", "input": "", "output": "You are going to turn the corner."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to.", "input": "", "output": "You turn the corner and see room 1620 up ahead. The door is open. You hear the faint hum of computers. There are people moving around inside."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to go in.", "input": "", "output": "Slowly you walk up the corridor until you stand in the doorway. A bunch of young people are drinking coffee and chatting in the center of the room. Around the perimeter is a ring of computers, all their screens facing inwards. A woman looks up at you...George, you've opened your eyes."}, {"instruction": "Stop, Doctor. I'm not happy about doing this. I don't feel comfortable with it.", "input": "", "output": "You're not supposed to feel comfortable with it. The point is to expose you to the feared situation in your imagination."}, {"instruction": "You're pushing me faster than I want to go. I need to take my own time about going forward.", "input": "", "output": "You don't like working at my speed?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Too much like the ghost train?"}, {"instruction": "Sorry?", "input": "", "output": "You can't control the speed of the ghost train. It takes you forward at whatever speed it wants."}, {"instruction": "I want out of here.", "input": "", "output": "Hold on, George. Relax now. We've made a good start today. I don't expect you to be able to go the full way immediately."}, {"instruction": "I don't know if I like this kind of therapy at all.", "input": "", "output": "I thought I had made it clear that you wouldn't."}, {"instruction": "Can't we take it at my own pace?", "input": "", "output": "There is a different imaginative technique we could try. It involves you creating the scene with only a little guidance from me. But I want to keep trying with flooding for a few sessions. Believe me, it does yield results. I have seen it work many times."}, {"instruction": "What happens when it doesn't work? Is the patient reduced to a drooling madman?", "input": "", "output": "I will watch out for that happening, George, and stop just in time."}, {"instruction": "Yours is a strange job, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Only sometimes."}, {"instruction": "I need some air. Or maybe a stiff drink.", "input": "", "output": "I trust I will see you in two weeks."}, {"instruction": "Yes...I'll be here. I won't be looking forward to it though.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to tell me about Elizabeth's parents' evening now?"}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, George. You don't sound quite yourself today."}, {"instruction": "I'm fed up.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about it."}, {"instruction": "I'm fed up with the way computers are taking over everything. I'm fed up working in a high technology company. I'm fed up with my office and its charmless modern decor. I feel fed up with everything today.", "input": "", "output": "Everyone has days like that, George."}, {"instruction": "I'm fed up with therapy, too.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mean that? Or is that just a random punch in my direction because I'm conveniently close?"}, {"instruction": "I mean it a little. I'm fed up walking over here and coming in to talk about my problems. We seem to talk and talk and I don't feel any better.", "input": "", "output": "I believe you've walked out of here feeling better on several occasions. It may not seem that way today."}, {"instruction": "It doesn't.", "input": "", "output": "Are you fed up with Melissa and the kids too?"}, {"instruction": "No. I'm not fed up with them.", "input": "", "output": "We really must get started with the flooding treatment again."}, {"instruction": "I thought you would get round to that.", "input": "", "output": "Of course I'm going to get round to that. George, you've made great progress since you started coming to see me. You have broken down a delusion which was holding back your career and your happiness at work. You have faced a very deep-rooted and powerful fear. We're now working to overcome that fear. What else would we do?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I'm not convinced it's worthwhile.", "input": "", "output": "This is one of the most effective techniques available for dealing with your type of phobia."}, {"instruction": "Mmm.", "input": "", "output": "If you were coming here every week I might be tempted to cut the session short and see you again when you feel more amenable to the treatment. But we only meet once every two weeks. This time is valuable, George, I don't want to waste it."}, {"instruction": "It doesn't seem as relevant as it used to.", "input": "", "output": "That can be a hazard of fortnightly sessions. I would really prefer to see you every week. That way we maintain the momentum of the therapy process."}, {"instruction": "Oh, let's try the damn flooding thing.", "input": "", "output": "You sound angry."}, {"instruction": "I'm frustrated and tired and I just want to get home.", "input": "", "output": "This may not be a constructive frame of mind to apply the technique in."}, {"instruction": "Oh, for heaven's sake just try! Look, I've closed my eyes.", "input": "", "output": "Very well. You are walking round the corner towards the room where you will attend your training course. You can hear voices."}, {"instruction": "I go in.", "input": "", "output": "It is a small, warm room. Desks line the walls and on each stands a computer. The screens all face the center of the room."}, {"instruction": "Yes, yes.", "input": "", "output": "About ten young people mill around in the room, chatting. They wear business suits. One woman sees you enter and asks for your name."}, {"instruction": "George Landau.", "input": "", "output": "You see a flicker of surprise on her face, then one corner of her mouth turns up. She makes a mark on her clipboard. \"Mr. Landau,\" she says in a slow, patronizing manner. \"Good to see you. We'll be starting in five minutes. Do get yourself some coffee.\" She indicates a nearby table which has a coffee machine."}, {"instruction": "Fine. I'll have a cup of coffee.", "input": "", "output": "You step over to the machine. It is black and oddly shaped. There are cups and saucers stacked beside it."}, {"instruction": "I take a cup and saucer. How do I get coffee out of the machine?", "input": "", "output": "It has an odd, molded domelike shape on top. There is a small spout sticking out from beneath a protruding arm. You can't see how to turn the flow of coffee on."}, {"instruction": "I change my mind. I don't want coffee any more.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about the machine?"}, {"instruction": "It's a pain in the butt. Why can't they design them better?", "input": "", "output": "You don't sense evil from it?"}, {"instruction": "It's just an irritation. I can't visualize it very clearly anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. You turn back to the group of trainees and the woman with the clipboard."}, {"instruction": "I'm not really in the mood to deal with people.", "input": "", "output": "George, you've opened your eyes again. You can't keep stopping the process whenever you feel uncomfortable."}, {"instruction": "I didn't feel uncomfortable. I felt angry.", "input": "", "output": "We have to explore your feelings. We won't get anywhere if you keep interrupting."}, {"instruction": "I thought I was free to take it at my own pace.", "input": "", "output": "We will make more rapid progress if you let events follow their entire course in your imagination. You don't want to be doing this for months, do you?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "We still have time to try again quickly. Are you ready?"}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "You are entering your office at the start of the working day. Nobody is around besides yourself."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "You sit at your desk. There are two memos there and, of course, your computer."}, {"instruction": "I read the memos.", "input": "", "output": "One is from Personnel. Some of your staff are on vacation or attending conferences. The others have called in sick. Even Simon Taylor is ill."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. What's the other one?", "input": "", "output": "It's from the CEO, Lloyd Major. He needs to know some financial figures by ten o'clock. That's in less than one hour. The figures are on the computer system. You're the only one who can get them."}, {"instruction": "Well, I can't. I don't know how to work the computer.", "input": "", "output": "They are very basic figures. It is inconceivable that you wouldn't be able to get them. They need to be incorporated into a report which has to go out this morning. Your job is on the line, George. Your family's entire income."}, {"instruction": "I must have them on paper somewhere.", "input": "", "output": "No. These are the latest figures. The computer has put them together overnight.
