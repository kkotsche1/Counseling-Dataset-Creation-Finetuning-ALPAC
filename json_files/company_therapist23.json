I've been called many things."}, {"instruction": "I'll bet you have. Hmm, let's see...oh yeah. I've been worrying a lot lately, and it keeps me up at night. Between the job, my old lady, and my busted-up rust heap of a car, I'm getting gray hairs. I've even noticed more hair coming out on the brush now. It sucks having this kind of hair, you know? Little old ladies are always telling me how nice it is, but I hate it. When I go bald--which will probably be any day now--I'll end up looking like Bozo the Clown with curly red puffs over my ears. I'll join the circus then and do kids' birthday parties on the side. I'll be raking in the big bucks then.", "input": "", "output": "Is money one of your concerns?"}, {"instruction": "Hey, you're a pretty good shrink! Yeah, I do worry about money a lot. I took this job because I knew it would be a steady gig and because I wouldn't have to deal with too many people. The money's not bad, but it's never enough. I thought I was doing all right this paycheck, but then I got these parking tickets...I hate those goddamn Nazi meter maids! Now I've got about twenty bucks left in the bank, and that's got to last until next week. I worry all the time, and my stomach hurts. Sometimes I get up in the middle of the night and go over my checkbook to make sure I have enough. This city is expensive.", "input": "", "output": "It certainly is."}, {"instruction": "For a while, I used to call the bank--I'd use the thing where you press one to hear your balance and press two to hear what checks have cleared.

What's the use if I hardly see her? She's been at Borders for a couple of months, and suddenly they put her on the day shift for no good reason.

I'm feeling kind of pumped up now that you keep mentioning her.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes it's helpful to discuss the things that upset or anger you."}, {"instruction": "She does both of those things. God, that chick is such a pain in the ass! I mean all women are, but she takes the cake. Last week, she had a kidney infection; it's the third time she's gotten one. You'd think she'd figure out how not to get one by now. She kept bitching that she needed to go to the hospital. I don't know why she can't do that herself. I only had one day off that week, and she kept crying, \"It hurts! It hurts! I need to go to the emergency room!\" I got so sick of listening to her that I threw twenty bucks at her and told her to take a cab. Jesus Christ!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I suppose her job doesn't provide health insurance."}, {"instruction": "No, and she's so fucking lame that she couldn't even get a job that did.

We moved here last year.", "input": "", "output": "After Lenore graduated from high school?"}, {"instruction": "No, I told her she didn't need to do that, why should she? You can always lie on a job application, they never check. It's not like a high school diploma means anything anymore.

Well, I sell a little dope. So anyway, my connection didn't come through, and I got all these fucking people calling me and asking for bud or blow, only I don't have any. I got so sick of listening to the phone ring that I pulled it out of the wall. I smashed my beeper, throwing it against the kitchen floor. It's like every phone call was lost money, you know?

It was some kind of downer. I think it screwed-up my insides. My mom made me stop taking it; she kept it for herself. She used to give me codeine to help bring me down--she always had it. She got it from the dentist, she was always having dental work done. Anyway, I have a high tolerance for medication. I need to take five or six aspirins just to get rid of a headache.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you get a lot of headaches?"}, {"instruction": "Lately, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You said you had stomach problems.  Aspirin can be very hard on your stomach, especially if you take high doses. You might want to switch to Tylenol.

I've hardly slept at all this week. Just look at me!", "input": "", "output": "I'd like you to try melatonin first.  I think you'll be surprised by how effective it can be.

Man, it's fucking beautiful.", "input": "", "output": "I take it your connection came through?"}, {"instruction": "I never thought I'd say this, but it was worth waiting for! This is some of the best weed I've seen, and there's a lot of it, too. I had the guys over to split it up, but I'm keeping at least an ounce for myself. This is some killer shit! And the meth he got me is the pure, high-quality stuff--you can tell by the crystals. I'll have to cut it for sale, but I'll keep some crystals for myself.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Do you distribute these drugs to others to sell?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and I sell some myself. Don't go lecturing me, Doc, okay? I'm not pushing this shit on anyone. Hell, they call me and practically beg for it. I even sell to half of the suits at SII. What does SII stand for anyway?", "input": "", "output": "Silicon Impressions, Incorporated."}, {"instruction": "Silicon Impressions, huh? Is that what you get when you hug some chick with implants?

It's the only way to make an honest buck nowadays. Did you know that it was how the old man, Joe Kennedy, made his fortune? He was a bootlegger. And what about the Mafia? They made it big selling illegal booze during the Prohibition. It's the American way, the old frontier way. If these pansy-ass liberals want to send all our jobs to Mexico and other third world cesspools, and raise our taxes, and pass these goddamn stupid fucking \"zero tolerance\" drug laws...well, I'll just be forced to bypass them and make my own way. I'm just a little guy with an entrepreneurial streak. Don't bring me down now; I'm in too good a mood.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Herb. What would you like to talk about today?"}, {"instruction": "What should I talk about? Should I tell you about my childhood or something? That's what you guys do in the movies and on TV.", "input": "", "output": "You can do that, if you'd like. Your past is always a good place to start."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll begin at the beginning. I was born in Hollywood, California, but Mom moved up to Fresno when I was little. She had me real young; she was only sixteen. That was kind of cool, though. All the other kids thought Mom was the coolest, just like she was one of us. She even taught us how to roll.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So she moved from Hollywood to Fresno."}, {"instruction": "From the home of the movie stars to the armpit of America! My Mom's family had a lot of money. Not like the Rockefellers or anything, but they did pretty well. They had a nice house and a big swimming pool in the back. I went there when I was five, and I still remember it. Her old man, my grandfather, invented a machine they use in car manufacturing. That's how he got rich.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Please continue."}, {"instruction": "I've got to tell you my whole life story, huh? That makes sense--you'll know where I came from. Okay, so Mom comes home pregnant when she's sixteen, and her old man hits the roof. The guy who knocked her up didn't want to marry her, he didn't even want to see her again. So she was really fucked. Her old man was ready to throw her out, but she said, \"No, no, Daddy. I'll give the baby up for adoption.\" Only she didn't mean it. Right after she popped me out, she hopped on the next Greyhound to Fresno. She didn't want anyone taking her baby away from her.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Mom worked as a waitress. She worked really hard, two and three jobs sometimes. When I was two, she married this big trucker. He was away most of the time. I didn't like it when he was home. He was one of those real mean drunks. He would drink and get angry and beat up on Mom and me. One time, I stood in front of the TV when he was watching a game. He picked me up and threw me against the wall. I was all crying and shit--I was just a little kid. He picked me up and made me go to my room. Mom left him the next day.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Where did she take you?"}, {"instruction": "We headed back to Hollywood. That was when I saw the house she grew up in. There was a high diving board over the pool, and Mom knew how to do all those fancy dives, just like in the Olympics. She must have taken lessons or something. Anyway, Mom asked her old man if she could stay awhile. At first, she told him she was only coming for a few days, a little vacation, and he said okay. But when she asked if she could stay a few months to look for a job because she was leaving Ralph, he said no. He said we could stay another week and that was it. I remember he wouldn't talk to me or even look at me. I didn't know why back then. Now I realize he thought of me as the little bastard, and he wanted nothing to do with me.", "input": "", "output": "What about your grandmother?"}, {"instruction": "What? Oh, you mean my mother's mother. She died when Mom was little. Her old man married this Jew broad, a real bitch--Jewish-American princess to the bone. She only married the old goat for his money. I remember she had these dried-up lips with red lipstick. She was scary-looking.", "input": "", "output": "So your mother returned to Fresno?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she got a divorce from the trucker. She hung out with this biker dude for a while. I called him Uncle Aaron. He was okay. He didn't try to be my dad or anything. He played catch with me and beat the shit out of me to keep me in line. Mostly he left me alone, though. Aaron was the one that got Mom into speed. He did a lot of it, and he and his buddies were always around the house, cranked up on something. There was a lot of dope, too, but that wasn't so bad. Mom was a waitress, and a lot of waitresses rely on speed to get through their shift.", "input": "", "output": "Last week, you mentioned that you were hyperactive as a child."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, my first grade teacher sent me home with a note saying I needed to see a doctor. The medicine they gave me just doped me up and made me tired. Mom didn't think that was right, so she took it away from me. Mom took it sometimes to help bring herself down.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, my med was a downer, a tranc, and that was what she needed. I think I was all hyper because I was a pretty smart kid and bored in school. I read a lot. When I was seven, I read \"Rosemary's Baby\" and \"The Exorcist.\" Mom freaked out, thinking I was into that Satanism shit. So she gave me a Bible. I read that next.", "input": "", "output": "Did you like school?"}, {"instruction": "I liked it just fine. I was in classes for smart kids. I have a very high I.Q. A few kids tried to pick on me, but I fought back and showed them that I could kick ass as well as they could. I was kicking a lot of ass in Junior High and High School. Mark, Mom's second husband, made me try out for football because I was so aggressive.", "input": "", "output": "What happened to Aaron?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, he went off one day to do a pick-up and never came back. Maybe he died--a deal gone bad or a motorcycle accident.", "input": "", "output": "Was your mother involved in selling drugs?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, Aaron showed her the tools of the trade, as they say. He got her hooked up with some people in Humboldt, and some bikers who made their own shit. You've got this \"I don't approve\" look on your face. But what you don't understand is that it gave Mom extra money. She didn't have to bust her ass waiting tables at a second job. And smoking a little grass is a good way to calm down. It's the only way I can settle down, else I get real antsy.", "input": "", "output": "When did you begin smoking pot?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I must have been twelve or thirteen, I think. Oh, and I used to steal Mom's speed before football practice in Junior High. I played a great game when I was cranked, too. I wasn't big, but I could run like hell and I could take a beating better than the rest of them. Speed wasn't really my thing, though. Mom really liked it, she was using a lot by then. I've got a funny story about that. Mom used to put it in her instant coffee, you know those General Foods flavored coffees? One day a friend of hers stopped by, and she offered him a cup of Swiss Mocha. Somehow their cups got switched, and he drank hers, prepared in her own special way. He was up for three fucking days! He was so cranked he was vacuuming the drapes and scrubbing the floor! His old lady figured it out, and said we should slip it to him all the time because their house really needed the work.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So speed wasn't your drug of choice."}, {"instruction": "No, I liked hanging out and smoking pot with my friends. For a while, we smoked joints laced with PCP and dropped acid on the weekends.", "input": "", "output": "How did your mother feel about your drug use?"}, {"instruction": "She was cool about smoking pot in the house, but she didn't like me doing the hard stuff. When she found out I was selling to my friends, she beat the shit out of me. But that didn't stop me.", "input": "", "output": "Did you buy drugs from the same people who supplied your mother?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. But I had other connections through school and work. It's like an unspoken language, almost like telepathy. If you put me in a crowd of people, I can pick out the dopers, the coke heads, and the junkies just by looking at them.", "input": "", "output": "I see. You said you didn't finish high school?"}, {"instruction": "Man, you've got a mind like a vise! You remember everything I said, huh? You must not have smoked any dope when you were a teenager. Yeah, I got tired of school. I dropped out my senior year. I got good grades sometimes, mostly in English class. I was in the smart kid classes for English and History. But it was boring. I was working as a busboy at Denny's and making good money selling dope. I didn't see the use in staying.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What did you do after you dropped out?"}, {"instruction": "Mom made me get my own place. She was let down when I didn't graduate. I worked my way up to a cook at Denny's and sold dope to the regulars. For a couple of years, I took off with my friends and did some traveling. We went to Amsterdam and bummed around Europe. That was pretty cool. But I couldn't stay there long--I ran out of money. So I went back to Fresno--talk about a fucking letdown! Anyway, I went back to Denny's and started cooking again.", "input": "", "output": "What brought you to the Bay Area?"}, {"instruction": "Mom got into some trouble. When coke became popular in the 80's, some cops were on to her. I think someone might have snitched her off. She was real careful, and she taught me good. I've never been caught, except for one time, and I was a minor then. About a year, year and a half ago, she got wind of an investigation. The police were cracking down on dealers. They had to go pick on a little old lady like Mom. She wasn't even a big time dealer--she just sold eighths and a little meth. Mom panicked, sold the house, and moved to Pacifica. She wanted me to come with her. So Lenore and I lived at her house for a while. Then we got our own place in the city.", "input": "", "output": "How long had you and Lenore been dating before the move?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, maybe a few months. When I asked her if she wanted to come with me, I was shocked when she said yes. I was only asking to be nice. I thought she'd stay in Fresno. I didn't figure she hated her old man that much.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How are the two of you getting along?"}, {"instruction": "Don't even get me started. With that kidney infection of hers, we can't even fuck. If there's anything more useless than a girlfriend with a busted pussy, I don't know what it is.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And there's no fucking way I'm ever using one of those condom things. You can't feel anything. I guess I'll just have to settle for blow jobs for the next few weeks. At least she can't complain with her mouth full.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, do you know what would help me, Doc? How about like Valium or Seconal to ease my pain?", "input": "", "output": "Can you get these drugs on the street?"}, {"instruction": "Oh come on, Doc. Don't judge me. I'm helping you--I'm telling you what works for me. I don't need to tell you this--I can get these drugs myself. I don't need a prescription. I can probably get any prescription drug you want.", "input": "", "output": "That's nice. But I'm not interested in helping you get high, Herb. You are here because you want my help. I think you need my help, too. So let's just stick to talk therapy for the time being."}, {"instruction": "Oh, Christ. Okay.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week, Herb."}, {"instruction": "Over, already? Time flies, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it does. Have a good week."}, {"instruction": "Okay.

I don't know what to do.", "input": "", "output": "It's not your fault, Lenore."}, {"instruction": "I feel like it is. He takes a lot of methamphetamine, and then he talks and talks. He doesn't mean what he says, he doesn't remember it either. He gets his make-believe stories mixed up with real life. I don't know what we're going to do about the money.", "input": "", "output": "Let's not worry about the money for the moment. Your landlord can't evict you, even if you don't pay your rent, for at least thirty days."}, {"instruction": "Really? I didn't know that.", "input": "", "output": "You said Herb is confusing fantasy with reality?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure. He says and does things just to...well, I think it's just to mess with me. Sometimes, he gets so caught up in his fantasies that he loses touch with the real world. He gets really paranoid and...I don't know, weird. It scares me.", "input": "", "output": "When was the last time he did something that frightened you?"}, {"instruction": "Last week. He likes to take speed and write--he says it inspires him. Sometimes, he's up for twenty-four hours or more without sleep. I can hear that typewriter going all night. He writes these fantasy stories, and he gets caught up in the characters. It's as if he doesn't know where the characters end and he begins. He also does this vampire role playing game with some of his friends. Last week, when he got a lot of methamphetamine, he was acting really strange.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "At first, I thought he was pretending to be a Dracula-type character. He would bite my neck with those fake teeth, and sometimes, he'd bite hard enough to draw blood. Once when I was asleep, he cut in my neck with a razor blade. I woke up and found he was sucking the blood out of the cut. When I jumped, he laughed and said he was playing a game. I wonder if he does it just to freak me out.", "input": "", "output": "I think you have good reason to be concerned. Is there somewhere you can go and live for a few days? A friend's house maybe?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't know that many people here.", "input": "", "output": "I'm going to give you a number of a women's support group. They provide temporary housing, if you need a place to stay. I'll write it on the back of one of my cards--Casa Las Madras."}, {"instruction": "Oh, no, thank you. I don't want to go to a homeless shelter.", "input": "", "output": "Lenore, please take it. You may not think you need it now, but with Herb's erratic behavior, it might be a good idea to have something to fall back on."}, {"instruction": "Well, you're probably right.", "input": "", "output": "You can also call me if you need some help."}, {"instruction": "Well, thank you, but I don't think I can afford that.", "input": "", "output": "Firstly, I would be glad to help, and secondly, it would still be covered by SII insurance--a telephone conversation with my patient's spouse is part of therapy."}, {"instruction": "I don't think Herb would like that. He'd be mad at me if he found out...Well, if Herb doesn't have to find out...I don't have to tell him, do I?", "input": "", "output": "No. I also believe that you should have someone to talk to, I think it would be a very good idea if you had a therapist of your own. I can't be your therapist, Lenore. That would be against the ethics of my profession. But if you call that number, the women's center would recommend someone for you, and these services would be free. Does Herb work nights?\n\nMs.Marconi: \tYes, he starts around five, a little after I get off work."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I just don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Lenore, from everything I just saw and from what you just told me yourself, I believe you are in a very dangerous situation. I believe that it would be best for you and for Herb if you moved out for a few days. Perhaps if you do that, Herb might realize just how out of his depth he really is, and I might be able to help him. I would also hate to see anything happen to you..."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess I can...no, I don't want to see someone else, Doctor Balis. They won't understand. They wouldn't know Herb. They would just...no, no! I can't just go and talk to someone like that.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure that whomever you saw would be..."}, {"instruction": "No. If you want to help, you have to be the one, Doctor Balis. I won't go to anyone else.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "You know Herb. You know that deep down inside, he's not like that. And by talking to you, I would feel like I'm helping him. If I talk to someone else, they would just put him away. You can't do that--you have a patient/doctor confidentiality. So if I tell you the truth, you wouldn't be able to do anything about it.", "input": "", "output": "I can't see you as a therapist and keep it secret from Herb.  But if you want to tell me things about Herb that might help me in his treatment, I guess I can stretch the point. But only on the condition that you make it safe for yourself.  I think you have to move out, for the time being."}, {"instruction": "I'll give the women's center a call tonight.", "input": "", "output": "How about next Tuesday at 5:00 p.m.?"}, {"instruction": "That would work, as long as I don't have to work late that day. Oh, wait! I just thought of something. What if Herb sees me walking into this building? I work near Union Square, he'd know something was up if he saw me here. I don't usually come to this area.", "input": "", "output": "Lenore, if Herb ever hits you or even threatens you with violence, you can call the police and..."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to do that.", "input": "", "output": "Methamphetamine can make people violent. Calling the police might really be the best thing to do."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Are you seeing an obstetrician?"}, {"instruction": "What's that? Oh, you mean...no, not yet.", "input": "", "output": "You should make an appointment as soon as possible."}, {"instruction": "All right, I will. Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You're very welcome. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Bye-bye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Lenore."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. How you doing?", "input": "", "output": "I'm fine, Herb. How are you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm fucking exhausted. I've got too much going on. I almost didn't make it here today.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you found the time to come in. But if you need to cancel a session in the future, please give me a call."}, {"instruction": "Okay. So what about Lenore? She really is a dim bulb, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "I actually found Lenore to be quite intelligent. But it was difficult to moderate a discussion with constant interruptions. I can't counsel a couple if one member persists in being abusive. A counseling session is a place to work things out, to discuss problems in a calm and reasonable manner. You spent the time hurling insults at Lenore and then stormed out when I disagreed with you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, okay. She just makes me so mad. No one else has ever pissed me off like that. Do you know what she did the other night? She's been ragging on that story I wrote, saying the facts are all wrong. She found this book for me at the library. It says Prometheus was rescued by Chiron the Centaur. I've never heard of that. I thought he was made to suffer forever.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And she read all this other shit to me about ancient Greeks being homos. I told her to shut the fuck up. My heroes weren't a bunch of homos! Prometheus was no homo.", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "I'm not talking about music, Doc. I'm talking Greek history and mythology.", "input": "", "output": "My understanding is that homosexuality was accepted in Ancient Greece culture."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. So maybe Prometheus was a fag after all. I wonder if he turned queer for Chiron as a favor for letting him go. I guess after spending centuries being chained to a rock and having his liver eaten by a bird, being fucked in the ass by a big, old horse cock didn't seem so bad.", "input": "", "output": "If I remember correctly, Zeus decreed that Prometheus would be released if an immortal being died for him and a mortal one freed him. Chiron the Centaur gave his life for Prometheus; and Hercules broke Prometheus' chains and killed the eagle that plucked at his liver."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I see. So Prometheus and Hercules were porking each other. That's not as gross as fucking some horse guy, but it's still pretty disgusting, though. Queers make me sick. What's wrong with them?", "input": "", "output": "I find it interesting that you chose to write about Prometheus."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I like those old stories.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel trapped?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? Oh, do you mean like being chained to a rock? Yeah, sometimes. And that fucking Lenore eating out my goddamned guts every day...she sucks out everything in my wallet, too. Maybe you'll set me free, uh? You'll rescue me. Only you aren't getting any rump-wrangling from me in return, no matter what you do, you got that?", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't dream of it."}, {"instruction": "You're not a homo, are you, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "My sexual orientation really isn't an issue here."}, {"instruction": "The hell it's not! It's bad enough that I'm seeing a shrink, he's got to be a homo, too. Why didn't you tell me, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Actually, Herb, I'm heterosexual."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doc. I didn't really think you were a homo. You seem like a normal guy. I heard the president of SII is a homo. I try not to touch anything in his office. I just vacuum real quick and get the fuck out. I wonder how many queers they got working there.", "input": "", "output": "Homosexuality isn't contagious, Herb. And you can't contract AIDS simply by touching the desk of a gay man."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's what they want you to think. I'm not taking any chances.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you feel such animosity towards homosexuals?"}, {"instruction": "Do you have to ask why? Because they're fucking sick, that's why! What kind of sick fuck gets off by sticking his dick in some other guys ass? It's not natural.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I'm getting grossed-out here. Let's talk about something else.", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "I don't know why that fucking Lenore had to go and tell me all that. She ruined my story.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like she had an interest in the subject, and she might have wanted to help you."}, {"instruction": "No, Lenore just wants to make me feel bad. She's like a little kid.", "input": "", "output": "She's still a child in many ways, Herb. Teenagers require a lot of patience."}, {"instruction": "She's eighteen, she's legally an adult. It's time for her to start acting like one.", "input": "", "output": "Have most of your relationships been with younger women?"}, {"instruction": "Most were about my age. I don't want an old broad, with saggy boobs and wrinkles and shit. My first girl was a really hot chick. She was only sixteen, but she was a lot more mature than Lenore. She was a wop, too. I guess I got a thing for Dago chicks. I was eighteen when I met Pauline. I was really in love with her, I lost my head. She taught me everything, you know, sex-wise. Pauline was real smart, too. She knew how to get under the skin.", "input": "", "output": "How long were you together?"}, {"instruction": "Two years. We fought a lot, yelled, and threw dishes and shit--she kept cheating on me. Pauline didn't work. Well, she didn't have an ordinary job anyway. She used to say I didn't make enough money, and she wanted to find a rich man.", "input": "", "output": "Did you meet Pauline in high school?"}, {"instruction": "No, she dropped out. We were both drop-outs. One of my friends fixed me up with her; he said I needed to get laid.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Pauline had no problems finding men. When she was mad at me or just bored, she'd go hitchhiking and get some guy in a nice car to pick her up. He'd take her out for a steak dinner, and then she'd fuck him or get him drunk and roll him, or both. With that face and that body she could get anything she wanted. She made me so mad. I ended up doing shit loads of coke to get her off my mind. All the coke I did made me crazy. One of my best buddies--he really saved my ass--called up my mom and said, \"Your son's acting like a total asshole.\" Mom came over the next day and told Pauline to pack her things. Pauline didn't even try to argue, she knew my mom. I was so fucked up, I didn't even say anything.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Once, I think I saw her in Berkeley. That was a few months ago. She was hanging out on Telegraph Avenue. I don't know where she is now.", "input": "", "output": "What was it that initially attracted you to Lenore?"}, {"instruction": "She was real quiet and sweet. She seemed kind of lonely. She has that long hair and big breasts, I really dig that. I asked her out because I figured it would make her feel good if an older guy was interested in her. I was doing her a favor, you know? I'm the only guy she's ever been with. She's never even had a date before me. Most guys wouldn't bother with her. Now I know why.", "input": "", "output": "I see. I'd be willing to try another session with the two of you..."}, {"instruction": "No, forget it. I've decided: she gets an abortion, and she's out. That way she can't sue me for child support. I don't think I can trust her.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think you can't trust Lenore?"}, {"instruction": "She's so quiet, so creepy. When I talk to her, she just looks at me for a long time and doesn't say anything. And some weird shit has been happening lately.", "input": "", "output": "Such as?"}, {"instruction": "A couple of times, I heard a noise when I was on the phone, sort of like a clicking sound. I think there's a tap on our line.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And there's this van parked across the street, a dry cleaning company's van. It's parked there every day, like they're doing surveillance.", "input": "", "output": "I think you might be overreacting a little."}, {"instruction": "Have you forgotten what I do? Shit, I shouldn't even be telling you this. You might be in with the Feds.", "input": "", "output": "Everything you say here is confidential."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, of course you're going to say that. Even mom is getting weird on me.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "I went to Pacifica to visit her, to tell her about getting married. I thought she'd be happy, but she had this look on her face like she was mad. When I asked her if she had any stuff for me to sell or if she could hook me up with someone so I could make some fast cash, she said no real quick. She didn't even explain why. Right after that, mom suddenly decided she had to go shopping, and we needed to leave.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I hung out in Pacifica for a while. It's a nice little town near the beach, but it was so foggy. It got cold, and the heater in my car doesn't work. And Lenore was looking like she was ready to blow her fucking head off. I wish she had. That bitch is nothing but trouble.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Is there a way you can recoup your gambling losses?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? Oh, you mean make some fast money. Sure, no problem. I have connections; I know a lot of people. If I didn't have to worry all the time about Lenore, I could concentrate...she's like a dark cloud, a big old ball and chain. I can't stop thinking about her. And the more I think about her, the madder I get. Well, there's no use talking about it. It just pisses me off.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes it's helpful to talk about things that bother you..."}, {"instruction": "I don't need to talk any more. I need to fucking do something. I can't think straight with her in the house.", "input": "", "output": "What is it that you want to do?"}, {"instruction": "I need to get a deal together, haven't you been listening, Doc? I need to find something to sell. That's what I should be doing right now. I have plenty of connections, I have favors to call in. I shouldn't be talking to you, I should be on the phone.", "input": "", "output": "Herb, we still have some time left..."}, {"instruction": "See you later, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Herb?"}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc. I can't really stay long this time.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I would prefer we do the whole session, Herb. Just coming in for a few..."}, {"instruction": "Sorry about that, but no can do today.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. New cell phone?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, it is! These things are fucking great! I don't know how I ever did without them. I've got one of the best ones, too. See how small it is?", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "They usually run about a thousand, retail. A buddy of mine got it for me for only five hundred. Cool, uh?", "input": "", "output": "Does your friend work for Motorola?"}, {"instruction": "No, it's probably hot. Man, I have the best fucking buddies around. I called in some favors, and they've really came through for me.", "input": "", "output": "You'll be able to recoup your losses?"}, {"instruction": "Better than that! Just look at this roll in my pocket. And I've got even more where that came from.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So you have enough now to pay back Greg?"}, {"instruction": "More than enough! This is all profit right here.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I'm not usually in the habit of giving advice on how to handle drug money, but..."}, {"instruction": "Don't go preaching at me, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Is it wise to carry around so much cash?"}, {"instruction": "I only deal in cash. Credit cards are for losers. Besides, no one's going to try to take it from me. Anyone fucks with me, I'll give them a little of this.", "input": "", "output": "Please put your gun away, Herb."}, {"instruction": "I got one of these too, as a backup.", "input": "", "output": "I presume you know how to handle firearms?"}, {"instruction": "Shit, yeah! I've been shooting since I was a kid. Piece of cake! I'm getting a nine-millimeter next. I've heard those really pack a punch.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I'm a little surprised you were able to make so much money so quickly."}, {"instruction": "I've got connections! But I'm kind of surprised, too. This is the most I've ever made in such a short time. Sometimes, life throws you a curve ball. Last time I was here, I thought everything was the shits. But I put in some phone calls, and the next day, I hooked up with a guy in Berkeley. Not only did he give me lots of shit to sell, he even told me where to go sell it! Not that I needed his help, but it's nice when things go this easy.", "input": "", "output": "Where did you sell it?"}, {"instruction": "There was a big party at one of the fraternity houses. All those snotty rich kids in their varsity sweaters and fancy cars were there. They had mommy's and daddy's money to spend. It was like taking candy from a baby. They gave me some shit when I first walked in--some stuck-up asshole pointed at my pants and laughed. What's wrong with my pants?", "input": "", "output": "I don't really keep up with fashion."}, {"instruction": "Me neither. You're like me, Doc. Stick to classics, that works best. I like these big bells, they cover up my feet. These are the kind of jeans bikers wear. You wear those sissy-boy straight legs, and your feet stick out like big, old clown feet. I got some extra copies of \"NetherLand\" from my editor--I figured those smart-ass Berkeley kids could appreciate it. I was going to go to Cody's Books and see if they would carry it, but I got kind of sidetracked.", "input": "", "output": "Sidetracked?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I damn near got into a fight with one of them--this poster boy for Aryan brotherhood.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You know my poem: \"My hopes were all in vain; Tears in cascading rain; Into an endless river of pain.\" That's one of my best works. This Hitler youth read it aloud, and then started singing, \"The rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain.\" Fucking asshole! I was ready to kill him! Some guys held me back. They were ready to throw me out on my head, but they changed their tune real quick when I showed them what I had.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I should have brought more, I would have sold it all! I could have inflated the prices, and they would have bought it anyway. I just didn't have time. By the time I cut and weighed it out, the party already started. These were the best fucking drugs these brats had seen in their fucking lives! I'm pretty sure I could have gotten one of those blonde bitches to fuck me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did you take methamphetamine at the party as well?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't want to do too much of that shit. I smoked a joint and had a couple of beers. Too much meth gets you fucked up. It's getting so I can't even write any more.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you might have writer's block?"}, {"instruction": "No, that's not it. I don't have the time. And it's all because of that fucking bitch Lenore! I'm doing this all for her, so we can have enough money. I have to pay back Greg, pay my rent, pay the PG&E bill. I pay for fucking everything. And all she does is sit on her ass and cry that she doesn't want a goddamn abortion. I don't know what the fuck her problem is. I tried talking to her, but she just didn't get it. Maybe her brain rotted out just like her pussy.", "input": "", "output": "You did try to talk to her about it?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I sat her down and said, \"You sad, sorry, stupid little cunt. If you don't get that brat sucked out of you, you're on the street.\" I don't even know if it's mine! Who knows who she has fucking that gross twat of hers.", "input": "", "output": "Was she treated for the kidney infection?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but now she's got something else--vagina bacteria or something. It's getting so I don't even want to fuck her anymore. I bet her pussy smells like rotten sardines, or cat food, or even worse. I don't even sit next to her anymore. I don't want to be in the same room with some diseased chick. I'm feeling sick just talking about it.", "input": "", "output": "Has Lenore seen a doctor about this?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I don't care. Maybe if her crotch rots away, she'll have a miscarriage, and we won't have to pay for the abortion.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I think she's turned against me. She treats me like I'm the enemy. I wonder if she called and told mom some lies about me, and that's why my mom won't talk to me anymore.", "input": "", "output": "You haven't talked to your mother since you went to visit her in Pacifica?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I called her a couple of times, and she said she was busy and hung up real quick. Then when I tried to call her back, I got her machine. And then she took the phone off the hook. I don't know what's with her, she must be in some of her moods or something.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Does your mother experience mood swings?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. My mom's a good woman and all. She went through hell to raise me by herself. She's done speed in one form or another most of her life. She's built up a tolerance over the years; she can do shit loads of it now. Mom's not going to change. And since she's older, she crashes more often.", "input": "", "output": "Does she get depressed?"}, {"instruction": "No, nothing like that. When you do that much meth, after a certain point, your body can't take it anymore. It used to be once a month--she would have to spend a few days in bed sleeping it off. Now, it's more like once a week.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Come to think of it, maybe she does get depressed. Once, I came to see her, and she was lying down on the couch, but she wasn't asleep. She was all crying and shit. The guy she was dating broke up with her, but that was months ago, and she was still sad about it. He was a real creep, that guy. He was such a phony, but mom couldn't see it. He was young, not much older than me, and kind of good looking. I always thought he looked queer. He wore those silk shirts in fag colors, like he was some kind of girl. He was only using my mom for drugs. And when he got tired of her, he dumped her--not even a thank you or a fuck you. He just stopped calling one day.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I wonder if she's doing that to me?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I wonder if she's blowing me off for some reason. Maybe she's mad because Lenore's knocked up. That doesn't make sense, though. She's been through the same thing. Mom used to let girls in trouble--you know, teenage girls who got pregnant--stay at our house in Fresno if they didn't have anywhere else to go. I don't know what's with her.", "input": "", "output": "How often did you and your mother used to see each other?"}, {"instruction": "I'd go visit her maybe once a month, and we'd talk every week at least once or twice on the phone.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Have you tried asking your mother if something's wrong?"}, {"instruction": "Uh? Do you mean like leaving a message on her machine--now that she doesn't talk to me anymore--and asking if she's mad at me and how come? I hadn't thought of that. You know, I could do that. I could just come on out and ask her what's the matter, did I piss her off or what. Doc, sometimes you do pretty well. They must have taught you well in shrink school.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you."}, {"instruction": "Maybe I should call her right now? She's probably home. No time like the present, right?", "input": "", "output": "You could try to do that, Herb. Our time is up."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I guess I stayed for the whole thing, hmm? Well, it's settled then. I'm going to call her and lay it on the line. I'll see you in two weeks, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Herb."}, {"instruction": "I'll take it any way I can get it!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Herb."}, {"instruction": "Man, when it rains, it pours.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What happened?"}, {"instruction": "My guy Benson gave me some more shit to sell. Things were going great at first, but last week, it all hit the fan.", "input": "", "output": "What happened to Greg, your other supply guy?"}, {"instruction": "I'm dealing with somebody else now. I'll get to that later. It's long and complicated, and I've got to tell it in order so I don't confuse you or myself, okay?", "input": "", "output": "All right. Please continue."}, {"instruction": "Benson got me another set up like last time: a shit load of crystal meth, plus some ecstasy and weed. Then he told me about a party a friend of his was going to. I didn't want to deal with those fraternity snobs again, but he said this was different, just a group of regular folks at a big old house in the hills. The people there were cool, no junior Nazis with an attitude. I brought Lenore--a big mistake. She was so mopey, it was like bringing a big rain cloud.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Why did you take her with you?"}, {"instruction": "Because I though maybe if she'd get out once in a while, she'd actually have a good time. But she was just set to be in a bitchy mood all day. She wanted to go to some church that night, and I said, \"Fuck that! I don't want no holy roller living under my roof!\"", "input": "", "output": "I didn't realize Lenore was religious. Is she Catholic?"}, {"instruction": "No, she wasn't even going to a real church, it was one of those anything-goes churches. What do they call them? Non-denominational. It was the anniversary of her brother's death, and she's got to do this thing every year. I told her it was fucking stupid. He died over ten years ago--get over it already!", "input": "", "output": "How did Lenore's brother die?"}, {"instruction": "Little Lance--God, what a faggy name! Why did they give a little kid a queer name like that? Good thing he died young, because he would have gotten his little faggot ass kicked in school. Sir Lancelot, Sir Fag-a-lot. Anyway, Lance died when he was four. It was some kind of heart problem. Lenore's mom just about died, too. She hasn't been the same since. Wop families really dig their sons.", "input": "", "output": "The death of a child can be difficult for any family."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I hear you. But after ten years...I mean it's not going to bring him back. Just get on with your life. But Lenore kept sniveling, saying she didn't want to go even when I smacked her. So I punched her in her big fat tits, that always gets her. She doubled over. And then I threatened to kick her in the stomach if she didn't go, and she gave in. I don't know why she's so worried about the baby. She's not having it.", "input": "", "output": "Has Lenore been to see a doctor about the pregnancy?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I got enough shit to deal with. She's got the medical benefits--CalaCare HMO. She's not a fucking retard, she just acts like one. She can call and make an appointment. And she better do it quick, or she'll be out on that fat ass of hers. Anyway, I dragged her to the party, gave her a beer, and tried to get her to smoke some weed so she'd lighten up. But Lenore just stood there with that look. I got so pissed off, I decided to teach her a lesson.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I took her by the arm and walked her upstairs. I figured there would be an empty bedroom up there, and I was right. We went into the master bedroom, and I locked the door. I started hugging her and kissing her, pretending to be all lovey and shit so she'd let her guard down. I waited for just the right moment, and then I popped her. I was really cranked--I'd done meth earlier. I was so mad, I forgot myself and hit her in the face a couple of times and then pushed her head against the wall. I don't usually do shit like that--I don't leave bruises where people can see. Her head was bleeding. And ordinarily, I would have stopped, but I couldn't. It was like something snapped inside me. I knocked her to the floor and started kicking her, her tits, her stomach, her ass, telling her what a worthless piece of shit she was. I told her I could buy a better bitch than her! I'm one of the biggest drug dealers in town, I can get all the chicks I want!", "input": "", "output": "Didn't someone hear you?"}, {"instruction": "No, there was music playing real loud downstairs. While I was kicking her, I wished I'd worn my cowboy boots instead of these dumb fucking Nikes. Her whole body was shaking, she was crying so hard. Then I pulled her by her hair and tossed her over the bed. I lifted up her dress and ripped her underwear off. That's when I realized she'd been lying to me. She didn't look pregnant, in fact, it looked like she lost some weight. And her pussy didn't smell like there was nothing wrong with it. I know what those infections smell like. She actually smelled good, because it had been so long. I wasn't really horny, but I wanted to give it to her in a way she wouldn't forget. I rubbed my dick hard, pulled it out, and fucked her pussy. Once my dick was wet, I shoved it up her ass. She screamed that time! I pushed her face into the mattress and told her to shut the fuck up. I fucked her ass real hard for a long time, but I couldn't come. After a while, I couldn't even fuck any more, so I pulled out. I was going to smack her around some more, but she broke away from me and locked herself in the bathroom.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do then?"}, {"instruction": "I tried to kick the door down, and then someone knocked on the bedroom door. I told them it was nothing, just arguing with my old lady, and they left. I decided, fuck it, leave her be. I cleaned myself up in the downstairs bathroom and joined the party.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What happened to Lenore?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't heard from or seen her since then. She can go kill herself, for all I care. I've done my duty.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, I sold a lot of shit, damn near all of it. I brought more this time. That's really the way to go: if you're going to do it, might as well do it right.", "input": "", "output": "How often do you use methamphetamine?"}, {"instruction": "Only on the weekend. Usually, I snort it. But my nose was kind of sore lately, so I've been mixing it in a drink or a soda or something. I was in a pretty good mood once I got high, until one of those Berkeley chicks brought me down. I can't stand those chicks. They think their shit don't stink.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "A group of us was passing around a bong. I passed it to her and flirted with her a little. I didn't even mean it, I was just trying to get my mind off Lenore. She was smiling, so I figured she was cool. She wasn't wearing a bra, and I could see her tits bouncing under her shirt. I told her she had real nice tits, and she made this face and said, \"Thank you,\" real nasty-like. What is it with these feminists? They can't even take a compliment? To piss her off, I asked if she would give me a titty-fuck, and she got up and stomped out. She even took the bong with her! What a selfish bitch!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "After that, the only chick who would talk to me was this really skinny bitch. She had a cute face, but she was a scrawny stick, no tits whatsoever. Her hair was all dried out, too. She led me into one of the bedrooms, I though she wanted to make out or something. Instead, she took this shit out of her purse. She had the works: a spoon, a needle. She was a fucking junkie! That shocked the shit out of me. She looked so young, she couldn't have been more than Lenore's age. She asked me for a light so she could cook her shit. I was so disgusted, I pulled the matches out of my pocket, threw them at her, and headed home.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And do you want to know what happened when I got home?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I searched my pockets and found that I was missing some money. At first, I thought I counted wrong. But I counted again, and it still came out that I was about five hundred short. That fucking junkie must have ripped me off! Junkies are the lowest scum, they always do shit like that. But I made enough money that night, so I thought, \"No skin of my ass, it's just a few hundreds.\" I didn't realize until the next morning, that my cell phone was missing, too. Man, I was pissed! I looked everywhere: in my car, in the house. I searched my pockets. I don't know what the fuck happened to it. That junkie must have taken it, too. And I really need that thing now, so I had to go and buy a new one, a bigger one this time. Those itty-bitty ones are easy to lose because they're so light. This one's bulkier and heavier, I'll always know if it's still on me. Pretty smart, uh?", "input": "", "output": "Earlier, you mentioned Greg. Do you still deal with him?"}, {"instruction": "Not anymore. He's not the good guy I thought he was. I paid him back half of what I owed him and explained it would take me time to get the rest. He was cool at first, but a week later, he was calling me and bugging me for more: \"Where's my money?\"", "input": "", "output": "You just said that you made more than enough to pay him back."}, {"instruction": "You've got to spend money to make money, Doc. I'm dealing in bigger amounts now. I had to get some equipment, and that costs money. I got a new scale, an electronic one. It cost a lot--I bought it new--but it was well worth it. It gives me the exact weight. I figured it was a good investment, I don't want to give people more than what they've paid for. And I was getting tired of staying up all night, smashing and chopping up the meth into a fine powder so I could cut it. So I bought a grinder, a little gadget that crushes the crystals. I found it in this head shop on Haight Street. It only takes a few minutes now, and my hands don't get tired. I've also been eating out a lot--I'm so busy that I don't have time to go to the store. I'm thinking of quitting this dog shit janitor job and dealing full time.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And I need some protection now that I'm dealing in larger amounts.", "input": "", "output": "Did you buy more firearms in addition to the ones you showed me?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I like to have one under my bed, one in my car, and two on me. I bought a couple of knives, too--you can never be too careful, especially in this city. I also had some work done on my car--you can't exactly transport drugs on the bus. And I made a few impulse buys: a new TV, a VCR, a nigger box. I thought about getting a little computer like the one you have there. I've heard a lot of writers use them. But I don't have a clue how those fucking things work, and they cost a fortune! I'll have to save up for that.", "input": "", "output": "So you've spent the money you owed Greg?"}, {"instruction": "It was all operating expenses, Doc, part of the cost of doing business: like the rent you pay for this office, the cost of your desk and computer, not to mention those fancy suits you wear, I bet they didn't come cheap. But you need all that shit to be respected as a professional, right?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Greg's usually an easygoing, kick-back kind of guy. But when I told him it I needed one more week, he hit the roof! He said he wouldn't deal with me at all until I paid him back everything. And even then, he wasn't going to give me the shit up front, I'd have to give him the money first. Fuck him, I don't need him. I'm doing just fine without him.", "input": "", "output": "Herb, at the last session, you mentioned calling your mother and asking her why she hasn't returned your calls."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I called her and did what you told me to do: I left a couple messages saying whatever I did wrong, I was sorry, and I'd make it up to her. I said I was worried about her. She finally called me back a few days ago.", "input": "", "output": "What did she say?"}, {"instruction": "It was weird. At first, she was real nice. She said she went up North to visit some friends and stayed longer than she planned. I knew what that meant--she has a friend out there who grows weed. I asked if she had anything to sell, and her voice changed. She said no. Just like that, \"No.\" And then she said she had to go and hung up on me. I don't know what the fuck her problem is. I'm about ready to disown her.", "input": "", "output": "Disown her?"}, {"instruction": "To pretend she's dead. To tell people I don't have a mom anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I'm concerned about your increasing drug use, Herb."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry about it, Doc. I can handle it. I've been doing this shit since sixth grade. I'm an old pro.", "input": "", "output": "Herb, I think it might be a good idea for you to go into a treatment program. I can recommend a good one, and your health plan will cover it."}, {"instruction": "Treatment program? What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "A drug rehabilitation program."}, {"instruction": "No fucking way! Man, I shouldn't have told you anything.", "input": "", "output": "I can't force you to go, but..."}, {"instruction": "You're goddamn right! I don't know who I can trust. I can't even trust you!", "input": "", "output": "I'm concerned about you, Herb."}, {"instruction": "You probably get a kickback for every guy you take down there. That's why you want to send me there so bad.", "input": "", "output": "No, that's not true. I believe it would be in your best interest to..."}, {"instruction": "Look, Doc, I know I'm doing a little too much meth right now and it kind of makes me crazy. But I also know how to stop. I'll just smoke more dope and drink a little more, and I'll be over it. I never liked it anyway, it messes up my thinking. I'll make a promise to you: no more meth from now on, okay, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "I think a treatment program is a better option for you, Herb. What you've told me about Lenore is very disturbing. I understand that the drugs contributed to your behavior. I also know that what you've done is criminal and if..."}, {"instruction": "That bitch wouldn't dare. She would never go to the cops on me. Thanks, but no thanks, Doc. I'll see you in a couple of weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Goodbye, Herbert."}]
