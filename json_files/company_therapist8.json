Whatever makes you most comfortable."}, {"instruction": "You have a file on me already?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, of course. And I'll be adding things to the file as I'm documenting your progress."}, {"instruction": "It's not easy being here.", "input": "", "output": "I know it must be difficult. But I'm glad you are sharing your feelings. That's a good start, Ms. Tanner. Would you rather I call you Rachel?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I guess I should call you Doctor, right?", "input": "", "output": "I would prefer it."}, {"instruction": "My grandma made me see you.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but you are here."}, {"instruction": "I'm curious, what did she say about me?", "input": "", "output": "I'll be honest with you, Rachel. Your grandmother is worried about you. She sees you spending a lot of time on almost ritualistic grooming. She's very proud of your ambitions and of your accomplishments, yet some of your behaviors she witnesses at home are perplexing to her. Do you know what she is referring to?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I do what I have to do to get through the day. Or night.", "input": "", "output": "She said you have a lot of nervous habits."}, {"instruction": "Yeah?", "input": "", "output": "Can you give me more details about that?"}, {"instruction": "I can tell you a lot about what I do. My question is will you understand? No one has so far. My grandma doesn't; she thinks I'm procrastinating. Or crazy. She hasn't said it to my face, but that's probably what she thinks.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I will do my best to try to understand you, Rachel.  Why don't you try telling me what's going on."}, {"instruction": "I hope you're ready for this. Whew! Take counting, okay? I have to count to get through certain everyday things like brushing my hair. I try to brush it 20 times. But if I think I've miscounted or brushed one side more than the other, then I have to start over again for another 20 times. The thing is that lately I doubt myself and become less and less sure that I've counted right. I think I've lost some hair from brushing so much. That's probably why Gram panicked.", "input": "", "output": "Would you describe your hair brushing as a ritual?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so. I do it several times a day and always in a certain way. Brushing my teeth, filing my nails, walking from one place to another in my house--those are all things I seem to get caught up in. I can't not do them. I used to spend a lot of time in the shower.", "input": "", "output": "Did you count in the shower?"}, {"instruction": "No. I had a certain order that I would wash myself. If I washed something out of order--like my right arm before my left--I'd have to start over. The order was hard to remember--actually, I think it changed from week to week--so I'd get it wrong a lot. I spent three hours in the shower once.", "input": "", "output": "Was your grandmother aware of this?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of. She was yelling at me outside the locked bathroom door. Then she tried to pick the lock. I think she was scared, even though I was yelling back that I was okay. Somehow, she knew I was having a problem. Then she changed the door handle to one that doesn't lock. Then she started timing my showers. If I didn't finish in ten minutes, she would turn the water off. I mean at the valve outside!", "input": "", "output": "How much time do you spend on your rituals during a typical day? Two hours? Four?"}, {"instruction": "On a typical day, probably four hours. That's for things that would take about one hour for a normal person. Doctor Balis, I've told you a lot about myself. Can you tell me something about you?", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  I've been a doctor for many years, although I've only been a psychiatrist for about three years.  I spent the first couple of years in a psychiatric clinic at Columbia University in New York.  And then about a year ago, I started my San Francisco practice--that's when I moved to the Bay Area. But you are the patient, Rachel. We need to focus on you.  Okay?  Now, why do you think you need to do your rituals?"}, {"instruction": "I just need to.", "input": "", "output": "Is it like an obsession?"}, {"instruction": "I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever heard of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder or OCD?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. So now I have a label. How does that help me? How can you help me?", "input": "", "output": "There are many ways that people with OCD can function effectively. The first step is being diagnosed. From the symptoms that you've just described to me and from watching you here in my office, I believe that you might have OCD. But I need to learn more about you and your rituals. Then I think I will be able to help you. Do you want my help, Rachel?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Good. The more you are willing to share with me, the more successful we will be."}, {"instruction": "I'm afraid that the more I talk about it with you, the worse it's going to get by bringing it to the surface, you know? I feel maxed out already. Some days, it's all I can do to survive a few hours at the shop. It's like I can hardly wait to get out of there, so I can...you know?", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about your work situation. Do you have rituals there?"}, {"instruction": "Well, manicures are all about rituals, right? There is a definite order to everything. That's what I love about my work. My obsess...OCD helps me in that case, I guess. I can count file stokes on each finger, count strokes of the brush when I'm applying color, set the timer for exactly five minutes, and stuff like that. Fives are good.", "input": "", "output": "Fives?"}, {"instruction": "Fives are good--five strokes, five fingers, five minutes--and so are multiples of five--five, ten, fifteen, twenty, and so on. Anything else throws me off, and I have to start over which can create real problems.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Your Grandmother told me that your problems started after your mother died?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. That was about three years ago. My mom died in a car accident. I think she might have been OCD, too. The more I think back on things she used to do, the more I realize she probably was. She always worried about my brother and me. I just thought it was a mom-thing, you know? Protection and fear about her babies.", "input": "", "output": "What kinds of things do you remember your mother doing that might have been OCD?"}, {"instruction": "Well, every time we would go somewhere, she would have to check the house. I mean lights, heater, the stove, the doors, the dog, the appliances. Sometimes, three times. She would ask us to help her, and we would try. But in the end, she couldn't be satisfied until she had personally done the checking. She was always so careful with us kids in car--white knuckle, you know? She never got on the freeway and always took the side streets. Always went the same way, every time. I could tell you stories...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "For years, I felt like her accident was my fault. I had a list in my head of all the things I could have done differently.", "input": "", "output": "What kinds of things?"}, {"instruction": "I tried to help her around the house, but it seemed like things had to be done a certain way. You don't know how hard it is to live with someone like that--like a perfectionist, only worse. I'd try to take shortcuts. She made me feel like I never did a good enough job. It became a joke with my brother and me--cleaning our rooms. We'd stash stuff under the beds, lie to her about dusting. So I guess my list includes all that dishonesty. We kind of mocked her.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that her death might have been your fault?"}, {"instruction": "Because we were mean to her. I think it was a suicide. The day she died, she took the car out by herself. She hadn't done that in years. I think she was so disappointed with us and so unhappy with her life, that she gave up. We might have been to blame.", "input": "", "output": "Do you still feel that way?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. Well, maybe. You wouldn't believe the thoughts in my head. I don't want you to think I'm crazy.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, OCD is a complex disease. It can cause depression and anxiety, but that doesn't mean you're crazy. And sharing the thoughts that plague you could be a relief in itself."}, {"instruction": "I mean, all the things I do are not really for the right reasons. Why do I retrace my steps? Why do I have to put my left shoe on first? Why do my nails have to be perfect? I guess it's because if I think I'm doing things the right way, then...", "input": "", "output": "Rachel?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm just so frustrated. I know I can't bring my mother back. I keep thinking that I've used up all my chances. I have to be good from now on to make things balance out--that's what I tell myself. But there's no logic to what I do. These rituals don't have a whole lot to do with my mom's death. They seem trivial, but I still have to do them.", "input": "", "output": "A lot of OCD sufferers obsess about doing things the right way. But that obsession is OCD talking, it's not the real you. Your thoughts get trapped into a rerun mode and play over and over again, is that right?"}, {"instruction": "Exactly.", "input": "", "output": "You said you had lists. Do you find yourself checking things, too?"}, {"instruction": "Certain things, yes. My lists are different than my mom's. Mine aren't related to safety as much as order. Oh, and personal hygiene.", "input": "", "output": "Your hands and your hair."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Tell me about your living situation."}, {"instruction": "My dad left just before I turned twelve--happy birthday to me. I've lived with my grandma ever since my mom died. Gram gives me a lot of space. I have my own room. We eat dinner together every night. She's kind of a loner, so it works out.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think your grandmother has OCD, too?"}, {"instruction": "If she does, she keeps it hidden. Or else I'm so preoccupied with my own stuff that I don't notice hers. Doctor, how long does a session last?", "input": "", "output": "About an hour.  I know that it's getting late, but let me ask you just a few more questions. Have you ever kept a journal?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like you to try to write down some of your feelings or thoughts during the week. It might be a good way to record the subtle changes that you'd feel as you continue therapy. If you want to bring the journal to our sessions, we can talk about it here together. But it's up to you."}, {"instruction": "I could try that. Thanks, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "In our next session, I want to talk to you about some relaxation techniques.  Can we meet next week?"}, {"instruction": "I'd prefer once every two weeks, if you don't mind.", "input": "", "output": "As you prefer.  Let's see, that'll be October 7th at 1 pm, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Are you going to talk to my grandma again?", "input": "", "output": "Not right away. Do you have reservations about that?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I'll talk to her, too--about the condition of your nails, of course.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't think they were that bad--good to hear some humor from you."}, {"instruction": "I'm not kidding!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Have a seat. You look different. Do you want to talk about it?"}, {"instruction": "My nose? I guess I have to, right? I mean that's why I'm here.", "input": "", "output": "How did it happen?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when I get home from the Hairport, I feel really stressed most of the time. I have to just sit for awhile. Well, actually I never just sit because I'm too nervous, but you know what I mean. Anyway, the other day I was at home at my desk, and I got out my close-up mirror and started to work on the blackheads and dirt that builds up on my nose during the day. I used my fingernails to scrape my face. I guess I got carried away. It scabbed.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I can see that. Are you putting anything on it?"}, {"instruction": "Gram has some stuff that comes in a tube that's supposed to be good. This has happened before.", "input": "", "output": "I see. By the way, during our first session, you said that you were afraid your symptoms might get worse because of meeting with me. Did they?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't scraped my face in a long time, so that's not good. But I haven't been counting things as much. Oh, and it took me a long time to get to sleep the night after our first session.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Remember I wanted to show you some relaxation techniques? Are you interested in trying one today?"}, {"instruction": "What do I have to do?", "input": "", "output": "Get settled in the chair--try not to move after you do--close your eyes, listen to what I say, and try to follow my suggestions. Visualize."}, {"instruction": "You're not going to hypnotize me, are you?", "input": "", "output": "No, I just want to help you relax. My goal today is to try to keep your hands still for a few minutes. Eventually, I want you to learn how to increase that time by trying this technique on your own. It will take concentration. So first of all, is there anything distracting you at this moment?"}, {"instruction": "You mean in this office?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "That clock ticking. And the bubbling of the aquarium, but actually the aquarium is kind of soothing.", "input": "", "output": "I'll take care of the clock. Get yourself settled into that chair. Is that where you want your hands to rest for the whole relaxation?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I can't move?", "input": "", "output": "That's the idea. I suggest putting your palms face down on your lap."}, {"instruction": "I'll try it. Yeah, that feels okay.", "input": "", "output": "Close your eyes. Your gaze should be downward--as if you're looking into your cheekbones. Tighten the muscles in your face. Really crunch up. Now relax them. Your forehead is free from worry; your eyebrows are relaxed. Keep your hands in your lap, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "Sorry.", "input": "", "output": "Your jaw is not tense. Your tongue should be resting against your lower teeth and against the bottom of your mouth. Your teeth just barely meet. Keep breathing steadily through your nose. Hands still. Raise your shoulders until they almost touch your ears. Good. Now let them sink away from your head as your muscles relax. Your collar bones are descending making your neck feel longer. Breathe. Hands still."}, {"instruction": "Argh! It's hard!", "input": "", "output": "Tighten your buttocks for three seconds. One. Two. Three. Let go. Feel yourself sink into the chair. Gravity is pulling you securely into the comfort of the cushion. Your arms are not resisting as they rest. Keeping your hands on your lap. Clench both fists, tighter, tighter. Now let them go. Breathe. Digit by digit relax you fingers. Let your thumbs rest. Release the index fingers. Now the middle. Ring and little fingers are completely limp in your lap. Very good. Deep breaths. Wiggle your toes and curl your feet inside your shoes. Now relax them. I want you to stay immobile for three full breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose. Now exhale all the air through your nose. Imagine your breath is a wave slowly filling your body and then slowly exiting. It's hard to tell when one breath ends and the next begins. Two more breaths. Let the air come all the way into your body, then release all of it. Last breath. When you've finished exhaling, very slowly begin to open your eyes. Slowly! Focus at first only on your hands which are quiet in your lap. Now let your gaze lift and focus until you slowly take in the rest of the room. That was very good, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "It was hard to get started, but then I didn't want it to end.", "input": "", "output": "You did fine, Rachel, just fine. How did it feel?"}, {"instruction": "I felt trapped at first. I didn't think I could do it when you said I couldn't move. How long did that last?", "input": "", "output": "How long do you think it lasted?"}, {"instruction": "About five minutes?", "input": "", "output": "Less than two. I'll give you a tape that has several relaxations of varying lengths. It's a commercial tape, so it'll be someone else's voice--a woman, as I recall."}, {"instruction": "I'll try it.", "input": "", "output": "Excellent. I'm pleased that you are willing to do some homework. You have to remember the goal while you are relaxing, however: to keep your hands completely still. Also, get rid of all of the distractions before you begin. You might want to tell your grandmother that you would like not to be disturbed for a reasonable amount of time. You can lay down or sit, whatever is most comfortable. Did you notice how your hands looked at the end when you were opening your eyes? They were completely motionless. Remember that image. You can do it. Any questions?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. What if I can't do this at home?", "input": "", "output": "You have to train your body to relax, so don't give up or get discouraged. It may take several tries. If you like, we can practice this again together during our next session. I'm pleased with your response today. I want you to start feeling like you're in charge of your OCD."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, when should I do the relaxation tape thing? Would it help to do it before I go to bed?", "input": "", "output": "There's a good chance that it will, yes. But experiment and try relaxing at different times of the day--when you have an opportunity, of course. You have to try and see what works best for you. How many hours of sleep is normal for you?"}, {"instruction": "Here's a typical routine. I take a short shower, then Gram rubs my feet with lotion because I get psoriasis really bad. Then I brush my hair. Then I get into bed. I usually turn on the radio and lay in the dark thinking. It's hard to say when I fall asleep. I would guess I get about five or six hours a night.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Is that enough? If you could, would you sleep more?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Did you try writing a journal?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I wrote twice. I forgot to bring it with me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you remember what you wrote about? Is there anything you wish to discuss?"}, {"instruction": "Well, actually yes. I had a major panic attack.", "input": "", "output": "Is that something new?"}, {"instruction": "Kind of...it happened yesterday. Swimming is the one thing that relaxes me and helps wear me out. But the public pool became a nightmare to me because of the hygiene thing. Gram put in a lap pool so that I could swim at home. She uses it too, of course, but it's a daily thing for me. Anyway yesterday, I was sitting on the edge putting on my cap, and I noticed three blackbirds on the other end of the pool.  They were in the shallow gutter taking baths. I guess you could say I lost it.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, they contaminated the water. Birds have all kinds of lice and dead skin, plus there was a feather floating on the water. I took one look at that feather coming towards me and started choking. I didn't think I was going to be able to move. That feather just bobbed and bobbed getting closer and closer until I almost puked. I finally crawled across the deck to the outdoor shower, but barely. The whole time I was showering off, the birds continued bathing, leaving their filth behind.", "input": "", "output": "Was your grandmother aware of all this?"}, {"instruction": "She noticed right away that I wasn't in the pool for my usual length of time. She came out when I was toweling off and asked what happened to my legs. See? She knew what to do about my legs, but she wasn't sure what to do about the pool water.", "input": "", "output": "The pool water is usually treated with chlorine to make it difficult for germs to live. And the creatures that parasitize birds are generally not interested in humans. Additionally, I'm sure your grandmother maintains the pool at the proper p.h.-level..."}, {"instruction": "She reminded me of all that. And I watched her pour in more chemicals right after the incident. Like I said before, a lot of my reactions aren't really logical. I know this. I'm a mess, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me something, Rachel. Are there times in your life when you feel like you might want to hurt yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Like my mother did? Doctor, that's why I stopped driving. This disease or disorder or whatever can make you feel pretty crappy. A lot of what I do stems from not measuring up, disappointing people, not being able to share my life with someone because I'm so weird. So the temptation to off myself does come up. It would be so easy to do it in a car. I was getting really scared--not to mention exhausted--whenever I drove somewhere. The concentration it took to keep it together would absolutely wear me out. Then I'd have a hard time getting to sleep thinking about who I could've killed including myself.", "input": "", "output": "Is that why your grandmother drives you here?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, she is my safety.", "input": "", "output": "Safety?"}, {"instruction": "Without Gram I wouldn't be able to really go anywhere other than work. I'm safe with her. I'm only talking about going to the grocery store, the library, the Hairport, and the video store. The rest of the time, I stay in the car or at home.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I think it's significant that your life is so impacted by your OCD. It's keeping you from enjoying certain privileges that most of us take for granted. Rachel, you're an attractive, articulate young lady. You have skills, education, and you're well-cared for. You mentioned feeling trapped during the relaxation. I'd imagine that your OCD gives you that feeling as well, right?"}, {"instruction": "Of course. Damn it! Why do I always end up crying in your office?", "input": "", "output": "You're frustrated. I suspect you might even suffer from a depression. I've noticed your honesty with me, and you seem very willing to work hard. I'm encouraged that you can make progress. But it's not going to be easy. Lots of things will surface as we continue with therapy. Things may get worse before they get better. We'll take it a day at a time. Okay? Need another tissue?"}, {"instruction": "Rats. I think I opened this thing up again.", "input": "", "output": "I'll get you something for it."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Will this help?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. A little lamb?", "input": "", "output": "It's good cheer."}, {"instruction": "You're going to make me cry again. I'm not used to getting presents. Do you always keep a bunch of little stuffed animals around for your crying patients?", "input": "", "output": "You never know when they'll be useful. Feel better now?"}, {"instruction": "A little. You're sweet, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Well, our session is over. I want you to continue writing in your journal and try the relaxation tape. Take care, Rachel, and I'll see you at our next session in two weeks. Let's see, that's October 21st at one o'clock."}, {"instruction": "Not that great, Doctor. I lost my job.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry. What happened?"}, {"instruction": "In September, my hours were cut back. That was when Doria, my boss, told me she might have to let me go, period. I think I shocked her, because I started crying right there in the shop. So she backed off a little and told me to just come in six hours a week for awhile. Well, I've been coming in on Mondays and Wednesdays  in the afternoon, but my clientele has been dropping off. To make things worse, when things get slow at the shop, I have to help clean the place up. But Doria doesn't make me sweep dead hair or anything, thank God. I just clean up the retail stuff, move products off the shelves, wipe the counters off--you know, jerk work. But you know what's weird? I checked the calendar and guess what? Monica's doing most of my people now--they're right there in the books. I'm down to four people when I used to have at least two dozen regulars. Doria has been scheduling my customers with Monica instead of me! I've been a nervous wreck ever since September, because I thought I was going to get canned. All that sweat for nothing--she fired me anyway!", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think Doria fired you? Any idea?"}, {"instruction": "I don't really fit in. All the other beauticians do hair and waxing and permanent make-up. I just do nails. And my hair doesn't look that great most of the time, so maybe she doesn't like my image. She's offered many times to give me a discount or a trade to do my hair, but as it is, I can hardly stand to be in the shop with all the chemicals and stuff floating around. Anyway, I didn't want her to see my...you know, bald spots.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Sounds like you weren't particularly happy working there."}, {"instruction": "I wasn't that happy there. I felt like a stranger more and more. Since I stopped driving, it also became an inconvenience. I guess I can think of a lot of reasons why it wasn't that great a job.", "input": "", "output": "Your grandmother mentioned that you had once enrolled at the junior college, but later quit. Have you considered going back to school?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "It's certainly an option.  And you might discover something that you really enjoy doing...a new profession."}, {"instruction": "Maybe so.", "input": "", "output": "Your grandmother said that you were a very dedicated student. Your family was proud of your grades."}, {"instruction": "Compared to my brother's grades, yes.", "input": "", "output": "You have to give yourself some credit, Rachel. And you've been open to my other suggestions in the past. It surprises me to hear you shut these doors so quickly now."}, {"instruction": "I'm kind of joking, but kind of not. I'm bummed about losing my job, but I'm not sure I'm ready to hit the books just yet, that's all. Can I change the subject?", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "I've been writing in my journal every day. It gives me something to do instead of nervous things.", "input": "", "output": "Excellent. I've noticed your nose has healed."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And I tried the relaxation tape twice. I like side two with the longer exercises. They go for about twenty minutes.", "input": "", "output": "Are you able to relax? The goal was to try to keep your hands still for a prescribed amount of time."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, I get lost in the meditation--I don't really know what I've been doing until it's over. I lie on the floor and I feel great. I don't think about anything except what Sylvia tells me.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia?"}, {"instruction": "The woman who speaks on the tape. Her name is Sylvia.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, right. Are you sleeping any better?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I think about the stupid job a lot. I think about Gram and my mom. I think about my brother and what might happen to him. I think about you.", "input": "", "output": "You've mentioned your brother before. Can you tell me a bit more about him?"}, {"instruction": "Michael is two years younger than me. He now lives in Sausalito with his friends because Gram kicked him out. He managed to pass the G.E.D. last month. He's one of those kids who is really smart but unmotivated. He waits tables and rides his mountain bike. He's cool.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you worry about him?"}, {"instruction": "Because he's kind of a druggie. Sometimes, I think he's too smart to let anything stupid happen to him. But then, I know how drugs can mess you up. It scares me. I do what I can to help him.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Here we go again. This is hard for me.", "input": "", "output": "I can see that. Tell me what you can. I'm here to help you."}, {"instruction": "Well, remember I said that I count things? Whenever I climb the stairs, I count. There are thirteen steps in my house, and that's an unlucky number. So I have to take two giant steps from the top of the stairs to reach my bedroom--that makes fifteen. If I have to go to the bathroom, that's two steps in the other direction--that's still cool. But when I have to take something to Gram's bedroom, or walk down to the hall closet, or to Michael's old room I get screwed up. If my steps don't end with a multiple of five, I feel like it will end up in bad news. I mean, bad news for Michael.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever noticed a connection between a wrong number of steps and something bad happening to Michael?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm, I'm trying to think. Um, I don't know. Bad stuff is always happening to him. His bike got ripped off, he cut his hand at work on one of the glass table-tops, his hard drive crashed. But I don't think it had anything to do with what I did. I just don't want something really bad to happen to him.", "input": "", "output": "So you feel like you can guard against bad things by carefully counting your steps and making sure that you always stop on a multiple of five."}, {"instruction": "I guess so.", "input": "", "output": "You don't sound so sure."}, {"instruction": "It sounds kind of lame.  Hmm?", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you think so."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't we do a little exercise? I have a tape player right here. I want you, in your own voice, to say: \"If I carefully count my steps and make sure I stop on a multiple of five, then Michael will be safe.\" We will record it and play it."}, {"instruction": "You want me to hear just how ridiculous I sound, right?", "input": "", "output": "I think that might be a good idea."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'll try it.", "input": "", "output": "I'm going to start the tape to give it a lead, and I'll give you the thumb's up to begin speaking. Say the sentence about five time. Ready? Go."}, {"instruction": "If I carefully count my steps and make sure I stop on a multiple of five, then Michael will be safe. If I carefully count my steps and make sure I stop on a multiple of five, then Michael will be safe. If I carefully count my steps and make sure I stop on a multiple of five, then Michael will be safe. If I carefully count my steps and make sure I stop on a multiple of five, then Michael will be safe. If I carefully count my steps and make sure I stop on a multiple of five, then Michael will be safe.", "input": "", "output": "Very good. Here's your tape.  Try listening to it a couple of times a day. Listen to the whole message each time. You can even make a tally marks on the tape box itself for each time you listen if you want to keep track."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  I'll try it.", "input": "", "output": "Hopefully after listening to yourself a number of times, you'd internalize just how illogical this obsession is and you'll be able to disassociate Michael's well-being from the ritual. The number of steps you take have nothing to do with Michael, and you know it. Now, you have to reprogram your brain to believe it. Your OCD is like a rocking chair--it moves, but it doesn't get you anywhere. Counting your steps is like that.  But I'm not asking you to abandon the counting ritual right now. I just want you to feel freed from the responsibility and burden that this obsession places on you."}, {"instruction": "That would be nice.", "input": "", "output": "Okay then. For the next two weeks, I want you to continue the relaxation exercises, concentrating on keeping your hands still. I would also like you to listen to the tape we made today. I'm glad you're writing your journal, and I hope you will continue. I would also like you to start keeping track of your sleep--note in the journal if you had a good night's sleep or not, how long it took to get to sleep, and if you remember any dreams jot those down, too. Any questions?"}, {"instruction": "You're cool, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. See you in fourteen days. Or should we make it fifteen?"}, {"instruction": "Funny.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Rachel.  Wait.  Actually, I have a conflict at this time.  Can we make it 3 o'clock instead?"}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "How are you?"}, {"instruction": "Not that great.", "input": "", "output": "I'm listening."}, {"instruction": "Well, I brought back the tape that we made last time. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to keep it. You can see how much I listened to it.", "input": "", "output": "Did it help?"}, {"instruction": "Remember I told you about counting the steps to my room and all that? Well, just from making the tape and listening to it those few times, I tried not counting. Then I tried counting by twos. By the time I got to my room, it was 28 steps, and that was okay because it was an even number.", "input": "", "output": "You replaced one counting ritual with another."}, {"instruction": "Yes, but I proved that it could be done or changed. Then I called Michael to check up on him, and he said everything in his life was cool right now. I probably shouldn't have called him, but I wanted to know for sure. So then, I tried only counting the stairs and forgetting the rest. As long as there are thirteen steps, then everything is cool.", "input": "", "output": "You walked up the stairs in this building, didn't you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but once I learn how many steps there are, it's just a reassurance thing that I count the same number each time. There are two steps to get into the lobby of your building, there are four stories with eighteen steps to each floor. That makes seventy-four stairs altogether--again, an even number.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm..."}, {"instruction": "There are four steps to the library and three to the Hairport. Hey! I suppose I could take the handicapped ramp and avoid steps all together!", "input": "", "output": "Great idea! Then there's nothing to count. Rachel, I'm curious. There are twenty tally marks on this tape box, so have you listened to it twenty times? How would you say you distributed your listening throughout the last two week, evenly?"}, {"instruction": "No. Those were all from the first three days, then I didn't listen at all.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Gram overheard it one day and had a fit. She wanted me to explain why we had made a tape with such nonsense on it. I told her about my counting things. She had no idea.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me more about her reaction."}, {"instruction": "I just let it all out. I told her about my fears about Michael and how I have to count and brush and everything. She listened the whole time, raising her eyebrows like she does but not saying anything. When I was done, she looked like she was going to cry. She said my mom's name in a breathy sort of way, \"Katrina...\" And then she talked about Mom and how troubled she was at my age. Gram said she had hoped that I wouldn't take on Mom's possessions--that's the way she put it--but now she sees that I have.", "input": "", "output": "Did you learn anything new about your mother?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Gram said whenever she and Grandpa tried to entertain, Mom would come in beforehand and commandeer. She would dictate to her parents where the guests could and couldn't go in the house. Mom loved to help get out the best dishes, but that was because she didn't want anyone but the family using the everyday dishes--the contamination thing again. She'd even move one particular chair into her bedroom, because she didn't want anyone to sit in it. That was a cool discovery, because that same chair is in my bedroom. It's mine now. But basically, Gram talked about how worried she used to be about Mom--her nervous little bird. She calls me that too, affectionately. She said one thing that freaked me out.", "input": "", "output": "What is that?"}, {"instruction": "She asked how she could help me.", "input": "", "output": "Why did that bother you?"}, {"instruction": "Gram doesn't usually reach out to me like that. And it made me think about my mother. Then, I was thinking about how tortured my grandmother must have been most of her life with two OCDers to worry about. I just started sobbing. I wish there was something she could do! I wish there was something you could do!", "input": "", "output": "Rachel..."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry. I feel like since I've been coming to you, it's been bringing things to the surface. I keep trying to do what you ask me to, but I'm not sure it's helping. I want the noise in my head to go away! Now that I'm not working, I have all this time to think. Just when I finish a ritual, I start the thoughts over again to make sure that there's nothing left to worry about.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, I'm going to review what we have tried so far. First of all, the fact that you keep honoring your appointments is a very positive accomplishment. You responded well to the relaxation we tried in my office, and you said that the tape is working for you at home. We made a tape to reinforce the notion that there's no relationship between your rituals and your brother's well-being. You were able to open up communication about your OCD with your grandmother. You said you had been writing in your journal every day--it gives you something to do besides nervous things. I suspect that your journal reveals much about your progress that you don't even realize. Have you read the first few entries lately?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "I want to discuss the possibility of trying something new with you. Rachel, there are medications available that have proved quite effective in relieving the tension and preoccupation that OCD can create. The best description I've heard from patients is that medication coupled with therapy can give you something equivalent to water-wings--some support until you learn to swim on your own. The analogy sort of works, except that I know that you are quite the swimmer to begin with. Can you see where I am headed?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You indicated in your paperwork that you're not currently taking medication. Is this correct?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "I would like to prescribe a drug called Fluoxetine. We would start with a small dose of 20 mg., possibly increasing it once we find out how you feel. It takes awhile for it to be effective. Should you ever discontinue it, it takes awhile for it to leave your system. I should also mention that there are a few possible side effects: headaches, weight loss, nausea, nervousness, sometimes insomnia. But very few people are allergic to it."}, {"instruction": "I have no problem with all that. I have trouble sleeping as it is, and the weight loss part sounds like a plus. So, what will it do to help me?", "input": "", "output": "This drug should reduce the intensity of your obsessive thoughts. It typically gives more relief the longer you take it, although we're looking at a long range treatment program with a goal of eventually discontinuing the medication."}, {"instruction": "Why didn't my regular doctor prescribe it to me?", "input": "", "output": "Did your physician know as much as I do about your condition?"}, {"instruction": "No, now that you mention it.", "input": "", "output": "I can't speak for your doctor, but some physicians of late are being accused of over-prescribing this medication. And I personally believe that general practitioners should not prescribe psychiatric drugs.  They rarely can do the appropriate follow-up which is essential for these types of medications.  Rachel, I still have a couple more questions related to the prescription. Is there a possibility that you could be pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "No, sir!", "input": "", "output": "That makes you laugh?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm not exactly active in that sense.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it's possible that the medication could make it more difficult for you to achieve orgasm, although probably not at this low dosage.  Is there any history of convulsive disorders in your family?"}, {"instruction": "Convulsions? Like epilepsy or something? No.", "input": "", "output": "Do you drink alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "Never.", "input": "", "output": "Then we will try the 20 mg. per day capsules."}, {"instruction": "Capsules? Are they big bombers?", "input": "", "output": "No. They are not any bigger than a large vitamin. You're going to take one a day, preferably in the morning after you have eaten a little. Do you have any questions?"}, {"instruction": "How long is it going to take before I start noticing a difference?", "input": "", "output": "You might start feeling one or more of the side effects I mentioned before you feel the benefits. I want you to give it at least eight weeks, unless of course you have an adverse reaction such as a rash. If that happens, please do not hesitate to call me."}, {"instruction": "You sure sound like you want to help me.", "input": "", "output": "Of course I do, that's my job."}, {"instruction": "This thing...this OCD is very lonely. Do any of your other patients have it?", "input": "", "output": "Their treatment is confidential, just as yours is, so there isn't anything I can tell you about them. Rachel, I wanted to remind you that what you say in this office, what you write in your journal are private communications. You're free to share things with your grandmother, if you desire. You said the tape surprised her, but if you want to continue to listen to it or make a new one, it's your decision. Medication is also your decision. But I hope you don't have to hide the fact that you're taking this medication from your grandmother. Does this make sense?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Obviously, there's a lot I don't share with her. I want to get well, that's the bottom line. I probably won't tell her at first. I want to see how it feels for awhile. For the first time in my life, I'm starting to feel more independent because of what I share with you. I feel like I'm finally acting on something that I was afraid of for so long.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds very positive. It's very important that you know that talking about OCD does not make it worse.  And there are a lot of people who suffer from the disorder.  How have you been sleeping?"}, {"instruction": "I've had two bad nights when I didn't fall asleep right away. I get restless, so I turn on the computer and play games, or e-mail Michael, or look up stuff on the Net. Before I know it, it's two o'clock. But if Gram takes naps, so can I.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe in one of your nocturnal ramblings on the Internet, you can check-in on some of the forums set up for sufferers of this disorder.  You'll find you're not alone.  Are you still swimming?"}, {"instruction": "Every day.", "input": "", "output": "Excellent. You probably need to keep busy. And when you are not busy, relax. Are you able to relax enough to keep your hands still?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. I guess I have come a long way.", "input": "", "output": "Baby steps. Let me write out this prescription."}, {"instruction": "Could you call it in to the pharmacy?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, if that's what you want.  What pharmacy do you want me to call?"}, {"instruction": "The one in the shopping center next to that Italian market that has the great produce. D'Anelli is it called? My grandma and I shop there once a week.", "input": "", "output": "That's a Walgreens, isn't it?  I know the Italian place. You must eat well."}, {"instruction": "Gram's a really good cook. I'm learning.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, call me if you have any concerns about the medication. It's also really important to continue to write in your journal. I was wondering if you would bring your journal with you next time."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thanks, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "See you in two weeks, on November 18th.  Is this time, 3 o'clock, convenient for you?"}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Did you start taking the medication?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I started on Wednesday, a week and a half ago.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I definitely feel the drug. It reminds me of those twelve hour cold medicines--you don't really feel bad, just kind of nervous. And you have to swallow a lot. I don't know. My senses are heightened, like I see and hear more clearly or something.", "input": "", "output": "Are these feelings unpleasant to you?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I feel like I have a lot of energy, and swimming has been fantastic even in the rain. I've still been restless at night, but that's nothing new. Oh, and my journal! Look at all I've been writing!", "input": "", "output": "Good, Rachel. Do you want me to read this?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's not why I brought it. I take it with me all the time now, wherever I go. I've been writing a lot. I'm going to need a new one pretty soon.", "input": "", "output": "What do you write about?"}, {"instruction": "How I feel. Things that happen regarding my OCD. Like the other day when Michael, my brother, e-mailed me, he told me that he got a staff infection. And I was going, \"Whoa, is it because of something I did or didn't do?\" So I wrote a bunch of maybes. Here, I'll find them.  Okay. \"Maybe I should never have stopped counting the stairs. Maybe I should just forget the way I arrange my stuff on the dresser. Maybe it doesn't make any difference what I do sixty miles away from my brother.\" It goes on like that.", "input": "", "output": "I like the part where you question the logic of your rituals. Could you read a couple more?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. \"Maybe my brother and I were twins, and Mom never told us. Maybe that's why I feel like my actions influence his. Maybe he has OCD, too.\" That's all.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, OCD is sometimes called the \"doubting disease.\" Your brain reroutes the same message, and you obsess over it. What you need to do is to break the chain of thoughts and redirect it. A good analogy is a car with a standard transmission--you decide when to shift, not your car. You have to focus your attention on something more constructive. Do something else when you get the urge to count your steps, or brush your hair, or clean your nails. Fight the impulse to call your brother or get reassurance from him. Replace the undesired behavior with another, more useful activity."}, {"instruction": "Like writing in my journal?", "input": "", "output": "That's exactly right. But do not replace one ritual with another. Don't pluck your eyebrows instead of brushing your hair, for instance. Some people try waiting for fifteen minutes when they first get the urge to perform a ritual. Set a timer if you have to, but wait. In fifteen minutes, you may find that you've forgotten that you were waiting."}, {"instruction": "I could try it. Maybe I should find other things to do besides write, though. Just in case. Like maybe take a walk or play the piano.", "input": "", "output": "Do you play?"}, {"instruction": "Mom forced me to take lessons. I hated it at the time, but now I can pick up any hymn book and play, as long as there aren't too many sharps or flats.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. It's also important to process your feelings after you've waited the fifteen minutes. Maybe you could do that in your journal.  At least make mental notes of how your symptoms feel and perhaps even wait fifteen more minutes. Try this with keeping your hands still or away from your face. Break the old habits, especially with this medication. You'll probably find that the noise you were talking about during our last session will dissipate. Have you given any more thought to enrolling in school?"}, {"instruction": "I've thought about it.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think I'm ready yet.", "input": "", "output": "I know school would be a big change for you. What exactly do you feel uneasy about?"}, {"instruction": "Well, getting there and back, for one thing. I don't want to be a burden on my grandmother for transportation, and I don't feel like I'm ready to take the city bus. And shouldn't I wait until after the fall quarter ends?", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, these considerations seem minor to me. I'm sure your grandmother would be happy to drive you. And there are classes that last only a few weeks and could be taken at any time. What else concerns you about going to school again?"}, {"instruction": "I just don't feel right about it. I...", "input": "", "output": "Talk to me."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's been a long time since I was a student--two years. What classes would you suggest I take? And don't tell me dental hygiene!", "input": "", "output": "You seem to have a lot of resistance to the idea of going back to school. Are you sure there isn't something else?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe. I don't want to talk about it.", "input": "", "output": "Is there something you're afraid of?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I said I don't want to talk about it!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Can I go early today? I don't really have anything more to say.", "input": "", "output": "We could drop the school issue for now and move to something else.  But... Rachel? Rachel!"}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to see you again, Rachel. I was very concerned about the way our last session ended and about your cancellation last week."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, sorry about that. I was sick last week, and our session before that was...well, I panicked.", "input": "", "output": "I know our conversation about school upset you, but I think we should pursue it."}, {"instruction": "I think I'm ready to talk about it now. God, it's all I've been thinking about for three weeks. Plus, I'm going to have to cancel our next session, so I'd better get it all off my chest today.", "input": "", "output": "Are you going somewhere?"}, {"instruction": "I'm taking the bus to visit my brother, Michael, for a few days. Gram will drive up to visit too, just a little later that week. Michael's going to take me to a concert.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you're looking forward to it."}, {"instruction": "I haven't seen his new place. Plus, his roommate sounds really cool.", "input": "", "output": "When is the last time you visited him?"}, {"instruction": "At the beginning of the summer. It's always a little weird being away from home, but I guess I'll survive. He's going to be working a lot, so I'll be on my own at his place. But it's by the water, and he says it's close to a lot of shops and coffee places. He has this great cat, too.", "input": "", "output": "I just got a cat myself, but I can't say she's great yet. Taking care of a kitten is a little more than I bargained for."}, {"instruction": "Is she at home while you're here?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Obviously I can't bring her to the office."}, {"instruction": "Why not?", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, I know I started it, but we should probably talk about you rather than my kitten. You said you were ready?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but talking about cats is more fun.", "input": "", "output": "I want to know what made you flee from my office, no pun intended."}, {"instruction": "Very funny. Seriously, I have a few bad memories of school...well, not really high school--although even then, I knew I was different and didn't make that many friends. At the J.C. I kind of came out of my shell. I took a drama class, English IA, anthropology...fifteen units all together. I really got into school, and I have to admit I was pretty good at it. My mom was having a tough time, though. She seemed really happy in a relieved sort of way when my dad left. But by the time I graduated, she started getting really weird. She had more time to herself since Michael and I were busier and not at home as much.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean she started getting weird?"}, {"instruction": "She didn't want us to go anywhere, but she didn't want to drive us either. She wouldn't let us get driver's permits. I didn't really care, but Michael freaked. He would yell at her, then storm out of the house--kind of like Dad used to do. Michael was having a hard time, too. That's when I remember Mom doing the checking. Before we went anywhere, she'd have to check the stove to make sure it was off, the dog to make sure his leash wasn't tangled, the phone to make sure it wasn't off the hook, the lights, the door. God, she drove us crazy! Oops, I guess I shouldn't say that, huh?", "input": "", "output": "It's just a figure of speech. So her OCD symptoms increased once you and your brother spent less and less time at home?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, now that I think about it. We were her projects. I felt like I had to come home just so she could serve me the dinner she took two days to plan and prepare. It was like her ego was on the table at every meal. She was definitely the Good Housekeeping mother. And I wanted to be a Good Girl. We were quite a pair, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you recall any of your own rituals at that time?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I had to have order. Everything on my dresser had to be in a certain place. I had to have my desk set up just so, or I couldn't get started on my homework. I called it my work dance--it was the dance I had to do before I could accomplish anything. I remember sometimes, I didn't get my homework done because I couldn't get things set up the right way. One night, I stayed up all night to get a paper done.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, why do you resist the idea of going back to school?"}, {"instruction": "Remember when you were asking me questions before you prescribed the medication? You asked if I could be pregnant? Well, I have only...you know, once. It was someone I met at school. He was in one of my classes, and we just started talking one day. He was kind of a loner, a little off, sort of disheveled. Our conversations got longer and more interesting. And then one day, we met in the library to work on a project.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "This guy was like a fallen angel--that's how I thought of him. He seemed misplaced, like he was too sensitive for this world. He was a writer. Anyway, we didn't really get much work done on the project, we just talked about stuff. A week after that session in the library, the project was done and the quarter ended. I was spending a lot of time thinking about him. I had built up a trust in him, and I guess that made it easier to plan for the big event.", "input": "", "output": "The big event?"}, {"instruction": "Losing my virginity.", "input": "", "output": "Oh. You planned it?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I wanted things to be just right. Well, they weren't just right. It was awful. I sort of changed my mind in the middle of it all, but I guess I wasn't convincing--he turned into some kind of animal.", "input": "", "output": "Did he rape you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, maybe.", "input": "", "output": "Is this the first time you've spoken about it to anyone?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "How are you feeling right now?"}, {"instruction": "Kind of sick to my stomach. Angry again. Stupid for letting him do that to me. Now I know how my mother must have felt.", "input": "", "output": "Was your mother raped?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently so.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "My dad went after her a lot, I guess. He's the reason she used to cry so much.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He made her cry! What do you think was happening? She never wanted to be with another man again after he left. She was beautiful. He ruined her!", "input": "", "output": "You have a lot of anger towards your father. How old were you when he left?"}, {"instruction": "Almost twelve.", "input": "", "output": "And do you remember your parents' disputes?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my grandma refreshed my memory. Remember I told you about that day when she and I talked a couple months ago? She told me a lot of stuff.", "input": "", "output": "What do you remember about your father?"}, {"instruction": "He kind of ignored us. He was always showing my mom off. He would give her money to buy dresses and then treated her like she was his date and us like we were in the way. He would slam doors and drive away mad. I remember that because one time, he caught her dress in the car door and tried to drive off. It ripped as he tore out of the driveway. She cried that time; all three of us did.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Let's get back to this young man at school for now, if you don't mind."}, {"instruction": "It was a mistake. In a way, I just wanted to get it over with. He seemed nice enough. Maybe all men are like that. My grandmother would certainly have me believe that.", "input": "", "output": "You said you were angry at him for letting him do that to you. You said it might have been rape. When a man takes you without your permission, it is rape. But you also said that you changed your mind in the middle. How did you let him know you changed your mind?"}, {"instruction": "I yelled at him and pushed him away. I struggled and slapped him, but I got worn out and scared. He wasn't a big person--I should have been able to fight him off.", "input": "", "output": "Many rape victims describe feeling paralyzed and helpless to defend themselves from their assailant..."}, {"instruction": "I feel so stupid. It was my idea to get together with him. Then things went bad, very bad.", "input": "", "output": "How long ago was this?"}, {"instruction": "It happened just before my mother died, so it was about two years ago.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that you are avoiding school because of this incident?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want to be any place where I can run into him again.", "input": "", "output": "I can understand. What do you think the chances are of that happening?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Slim?", "input": "", "output": "Probably. He might not even be enrolled in school anymore--that was two years ago."}, {"instruction": "He might not even live in the state any more. Maybe even if I did see him he wouldn't recognize me. I know all this, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad. Rachel, your OCD has kept you from activities that other twenty-one year olds are enjoying. Rape and associated psychological trauma has made it even more difficult.  But you really are making great progress in our therapy sessions. And I would like to encourage you to try some new things. Staying with your brother is good. You will be away from the security and normalcy of your home for a few days. I'm very eager to hear how things go for you. I'm also anxious to find out how the medication is working."}, {"instruction": "So far, so good. It still takes me a while to get to sleep, but I feel like I'm more rested when I wake up. On the other hand, I feel like I'm wired most of the time. And I'm losing weight.", "input": "", "output": "I noticed the weight loss. Increased agitation is a side effect that some people on this medication report. I'm glad that it doesn't interfere with your sleep. And sometimes, you can redirect the nervousness."}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "You're already doing it--you write in your journal, you play the piano, you swim. Let's continue with 20 mg. for another few weeks.  All right?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. You know what else? I don't really seem to want to do the counting and the rituals as much. I'll probably always fidget with my nails, but I just brush my hair in the morning now or after I wash it, and that's all. And I've been taking a lot of baths instead of showers, so there's no rituals, at least with washing.", "input": "", "output": "Why does that make you giggle?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if I should tell you.", "input": "", "output": "It's up to you."}, {"instruction": "Well, I have had a hard time...um, climaxing. You said the drug could have that effect. So I found a way that I can use the bath water as it's coming out of the fixture to...you know.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Feeling sexual is a sign of good health."}, {"instruction": "Then I must be pretty healthy! And, Doctor? I think telling you about the..about the rape...well, I think it made me feel better.  It's like some weight has been lifted.  Do you know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "I do.  I'm glad it helped."}, {"instruction": "But I'm still pissed. And I'm still angry with my dad. Michael and I talk about this every once in a while. And I don't know how to get relief over that one.", "input": "", "output": "It's getting rather late. Let's plan on taking that subject up after you get back from your vacation. When are you coming back?"}, {"instruction": "We won't be back until Christmas Eve.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. If we keep your sessions on Tuesdays, we won't meet again until January 6th. How does that sound?"}, {"instruction": "That sounds okay with me, actually.", "input": "", "output": "This was a good session, Rachel. You really opened up."}, {"instruction": "I feel better after getting things off my chest and off my brain.", "input": "", "output": "It shows."}, {"instruction": "Well, Happy Holidays. Good luck with your new kitten.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. I won't be in the office for a week between Christmas and New Year's, but feel free to call if you need to--my answering service knows how to track me down."}, {"instruction": "See you next year!", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "Same to you.", "input": "", "output": "How was your week away from home?"}, {"instruction": "It was a good visit. I wish I could have stayed longer. I was starting to get used to the lifestyles of the poor and degenerate.", "input": "", "output": "That would be your brother and his roommate?"}, {"instruction": "Exactly. Michael wasn't around that much because he had to work. I was a little concerned about having to spend a lot of time by myself, but it didn't turn out that way. Evan was there most of the time, except when they'd take off mountain biking.", "input": "", "output": "Did you feel comfortable in Michael's home?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, except for one incident. They both seemed comfortable having me there. I used the laundry and bike room as my own. They set up a cot, and there was a laundry tub with hot and cold water. In one sunny corner was a big chair where I sat to do my journaling with bicycles hanging over my head and Sssh in my lap.", "input": "", "output": "Sssh?"}, {"instruction": "Those stupid boys named their cat Shit Head, but now they call her Sssh as in her abbreviations, S.H. They didn't really know how to train her when they first got her, so she was on their bad side a lot. Now she's pretty close to what I'd call a perfect cat.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. You mentioned there was one unpleasant incident. Do you want to share it with me?"}, {"instruction": "I guess. Evan is a DiCaprio/Chandler cross. Adorable. I think I experienced my most embarrassing moment to date.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I thought I was alone, because Michael was at work and Evan had left for a ride. I couldn't wait to get into the bathtub. There I was laying on the bottom of the tub, warm water flowing, legs spread so I could...you know? And Evan walked in! I guess he thought I was just getting the tub ready. He thought he could dart in to get his cycling gloves that were hanging on the towel rack to dry. Oh my God! I was so freaked!", "input": "", "output": "How did he react?"}, {"instruction": "He said, \"Whoops!\" But he got a good look. I didn't say a word. He was gone for about three hours on his ride. I dreaded seeing him again. Here I had this major crush on him. I had one more day until Gram picked me up. And he caught me getting myself off. I'm afraid it brought back some of my old habits.", "input": "", "output": "Which ones?"}, {"instruction": "I showered until the water got cold. I brushed my hair until my scalp hurt. I didn't do any damage, but still. I guess the only good thing was that I stopped my rituals. It was not because I felt like I had completed the tasks, but rather because I felt silly--like it wasn't going to do me any good.", "input": "", "output": "So you didn't repeat any of your rituals later?"}, {"instruction": "No. When Evan got home, he acted like nothing had happened. I'm sure I blushed like a young bride, but I'm hoping he didn't notice. Once my brother got home, things felt like normal again. Actually, better than normal--that was a concert night, and we were in the mood to party.", "input": "", "output": "Does your brother knows about your OCD? Does Evan?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. We talked about it the first day I got there. Michael must have told him, because he asked me over and over if the laundry room was going to be an okay place for me to hang out. Then he said he knew about it. He was really cool to talk to. He made it sound like it was normal to have nervous little habits, and he described some of his own. We laughed a lot.", "input": "", "output": "So how was the concert?"}, {"instruction": "Great. It was at the Concord Pavilion. We got to sit outside under the stars. They were spinning.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's confession time. I smoked some pot and had a couple of beers. Michael didn't pressure me; it wasn't like that. And it wasn't a first or anything. It's like an everyday thing for my brother. And I just wanted to party with the boys. I'm glad I did. Why do you look so serious?", "input": "", "output": "I can't condone recreational drug use, Rachel. It goes with my profession. Did you consider that it might interfere with the medication you are taking?"}, {"instruction": "You didn't warn me about it, so I assumed it wouldn't hurt. It didn't hurt, as a matter of fact. I had a great time. Please, don't pull a Dad thing on me, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "It's a Doctor thing, Rachel. Please continue."}, {"instruction": "Anyway. A day later, Gram took us all out for dinner and then drove me home. How depressing.", "input": "", "output": "To be home again?"}, {"instruction": "How do you keep them down on the farm, once they've seen Sausalito?", "input": "", "output": "Are you really depressed?"}, {"instruction": "You're so clinical today, Doctor. No, it's just an overused expression. Actually, I think I'm ready to try school again.", "input": "", "output": "Did our discussion last time help you decide?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. That and having a good time at my brother's. Surviving all those new experiences helped me realize that I'm not that far from normal. When I think of how I was back in August, when I first started seeing you, I'm amazed. I want to know how much of this is the fluoxetine. And what happens when you take me off it?", "input": "", "output": "Fluoxetine is used to help relieve the urge to perform rituals in the OCD patients. Serotonin uptake inhibitors help cut out the background noise that patients, including you, have described. Do you find that your self-talk is not only reduced now, but focused more on what you're doing right, rather than on what you're doing wrong?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "And so with more positive feedback, your confidence has increased, allowing you more freedom--freedom to travel, freedom to try new things..."}, {"instruction": "Freedom to explore my sexuality.", "input": "", "output": "That too. And freedom to go back to your old life or the better parts of it. I'm pleased to hear that you want to try school again. When does it start?"}, {"instruction": "In a few weeks. I won't get a very good selection of classes, since I'm registering late. But...oh well.", "input": "", "output": "It's a start. I didn't answer all of your questions about the medication. For now, I would like to continue with the same dosage and continue with sessions every two weeks. Let's give school a chance. Rachel, some people stay with this medication for years, particularly in cases of chronic depression. I'm hopeful that as your OCD symptoms decrease, your need for medication will diminish. When we do decide to discontinue, it will take a few weeks for it to actually leave your system. But let's not rush into anything just yet. Let's continue with the medication."}, {"instruction": "So, I'll see you in two weeks?", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I'm going on vacation.  I'll be gone the next two weeks.  So how about Tuesday, January 27th?"}, {"instruction": "That's fine.  I'll be busy with school anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Good. And good luck with the registration."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doc.  Have a good time.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you.  Goodbye, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "So so.", "input": "", "output": "How is school going for you? Did you register?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I'm taking Speech, Modern Poetry, and Anthropology. It's quite a load; I'm barely keeping my head above water. I wish I could just attend classes but not have to do any work. It's a drag. I have two papers due next week and two tests this week.", "input": "", "output": "You're still taking the medication, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but...", "input": "", "output": "But what?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think it's working that well.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say that?"}, {"instruction": "Can't you tell? I thought you, of all people, would notice right away how crappy I look. And I look how I feel.", "input": "", "output": "There's a lot more stress in your life now. How has that manifested itself?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean? Could you try not to sound too much like a doctor?", "input": "", "output": "What makes you think the Fluoxetine is not working?"}, {"instruction": "Let's see, where should I start? I'm sleeping about four hours a night, if that. My grandma is bitching about being my chauffeur. I have to read most assignments four times because I can't concentrate. It takes me all night to write one page that I'm still not happy with. Want more?", "input": "", "output": "I understand that school puts a lot of strain on you, Rachel. But what you've described is fairly typical for most students who care about their performance. Let's take one thing at a time. I'm concerned that you are not sleeping enough, and yes, I did notice that you look tired. Tell me about your evenings."}, {"instruction": "Gram and I are still eating dinner together, but she's ragging on me most of the time. I get restless with the small talk at the table because I have so much to do. It isn't that satisfying for either of us. Then I head to my bedroom where I spend the rest of the night reading, writing, and suffering. Sometimes, it's two o'clock before I realize it.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still swimming? Do you continue to write in your journal?"}, {"instruction": "I swim every other day. Nothing...well, almost nothing can interfere with that. The journal is dead. No time.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. You should try to maintain a balance between school work and the other things that you enjoy. You need to release the tension in healthy ways."}, {"instruction": "I'm dealing with it.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "I have my ways.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, I detect hostility from you today. I need you to be open and honest with me and help me to help you."}, {"instruction": "You want to help me? You could have helped me by suggesting that I wait, that I recover a little longer before going back to school. You could have reminded me of how stressful it is to run around registering at the last minute for classes that I don't want to take, trying to buy books that the bookstore just ran out of, going to hell and back to find out what everyone knew except me: that the room number had been changed. I don't know why I'm doing this to myself!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What can I do for you right now?"}, {"instruction": "Get me a glass of water.", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  You want to try some guided relaxation?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure I can sit still enough for it to do any good.", "input": "", "output": "Let's try it. Finish your water, and we will try a brief breathing session."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "First of all, get settled so that you can close your eyes and listen. Take three regular breaths through your nose. Exhale completely each time. Good. Now, very slowly inhale--no noise--until you've filled your lungs. Try to quiet your body, Rachel. Silently exhale through your nostrils. Slowly! Gently push all that air out. Breathe this way three more times on your own. When you are done, open your eyes."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Need some more water?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, please.", "input": "", "output": "You said you were having trouble concentrating while reading, and you were not content with your finished written products. Do you think your OCD is interfering somehow?"}, {"instruction": "I have to reread the passages because I'm afraid I might have missed something. I go over and over them, and then the words don't even make sense. I tried getting up and walking around to clear my head, but then I started counting steps again. I made up this stupid rule--I can't sit down and try reading again until I've walked fifteen steps. They have to be perfect steps or the reading won't be perfect. I slipped back into the counting. And with the writing, it's like it has to be flawless. I do it on the computer first, and I fix my spelling and do a grammar check. But I don't trust the computer, so I print the first draft, then write the whole thing out by hand. Then I put that away for awhile and make more changes later to get it right. Every time I look at my writing, I find something else to change or make better. How can I ever be sure that it's right?", "input": "", "output": "I want you to try something. I want you to write a paragraph for me about...let's see...write a short note to your brother about anything you like. Here is paper, here is a pencil. No, use a pen."}, {"instruction": "This is silly. Why?", "input": "", "output": "Actually, this is a valid method for OCD patients. You are going to write a letter to your brother, put it in an envelope, and seal it. We are going to walk down to the mailbox and mail it together. If it has mistakes, so be it. If it's not perfect, so be it. The idea is to take this extra energy off your writing, this need to be perfect. The perfection issue is getting in your way. I assume your brother is a person you trust. I suggested him because he won't criticize, and probably won't even notice any errors in your note to him. Am I right?"}, {"instruction": "Probably.", "input": "", "output": "This technique is called \"response prevention.\" Do you know why?"}, {"instruction": "Because by mailing it, I won't be able to change anything. I can't respond to the letter like I would to the other things I write, because it will be buried in the mailbox on its way to my brother's house.", "input": "", "output": "Exactly. So pick a simple topic or just say hello to your brother in a short note. Take four or five minutes."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "And address the envelope. Here's a stamp."}, {"instruction": "Are we really going to go mail it?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. I want you to see that laboring over your written work is not going to change the basic message. You are smart, and your writing is clear and comprehensible. It is good to be conscientious about your performance at school. It is not good to be obsessive about it. Hopefully, through this exercise, you'll make the transfer to your schoolwork. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be enough. Now, you said something earlier that I cannot dismiss. You said you have ways of relieving your tension. I believe you said, \"I have my ways.\" What did you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I've been bad.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "At first, I did it without even thinking. Then, it seemed like it was soothing. Now, I'm back to my old bullshit. I already mentioned that I started counting again. But I've lost some hair, too. On my first speech, I wanted to do really well. I was charged up about it. I worked on my note cards for two hours before I realized that I'd pulled out quite a bit of hair. You can't really see it because it's all underneath, but still...", "input": "", "output": "I see. But this behavior brings you comfort."}, {"instruction": "Sort of. I mean, I feel bad afterwards. But I can't really help it or stop it when it's happening.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, you can stop it. You've done it before, and you'll stop it again, Rachel. You have to replace the act with something more positive. Writing in your journal was supposed to that. It replaced the other activities. Walking a dog, playing the piano, jumping on a trampoline are all things you can do to occupy your time, your hands, and your mind. Do you still have the relaxation tape I gave you?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. It's been a while.", "input": "", "output": "You have to answer to your OCD. Tell it who's boss. OCD is a paper tiger, but taming it is a constant job. You were able to let up a bit in your regimen, but now it's time to get tough again. Understand?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. It's not easy. I guess the stress of school brought up the old stuff. I got weak.", "input": "", "output": "You are just as strong as you ever were, Rachel. You have a lot of tricks up your sleeve. You have to employ all the strategies that have worked in the past again. I know school is important to you. I would like to see you succeed. Canceling sessions won't help, either. Make room for important things; make room for Rachel. Are you ready to go for a walk?"}, {"instruction": "Ready as I'll ever be.", "input": "", "output": "Our next session will be March 3rd then, correct?"}, {"instruction": "Two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Shall we go?"}, {"instruction": "This feels weird.", "input": "", "output": "We don't have far to go. The mailbox is just around the corner."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Let's cross here, so we don't have to go through, what I affectionately now call, the Lake District. It always floods at that intersection. Does this seem like a lot of trouble?"}, {"instruction": "It's kind of fun, actually. Want to go to the post office instead?", "input": "", "output": "I have a four o'clock waiting for me."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I noticed. She didn't look so good. But then, who am I to say?", "input": "", "output": "Do you have any reservations about letting this letter go?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of. I rushed through it, because I didn't want to make you wait. Now, I wish I could open it up and look it over one more time.", "input": "", "output": "Everyone makes mistakes. Even I do, once in a while."}, {"instruction": "It doesn't really say anything important. Do I have to send it? You've proven your point.", "input": "", "output": "I know this must be difficult for you, but don't feed your OCD. Don't let it have power over you. Have you started the two papers that are due this week?"}, {"instruction": "I only have a few notes. I was going to work on one of them tonight. It's due Monday, but it only has to be one page.", "input": "", "output": "I want you to set a timer for 25 minutes when you start to work on it. When the timer goes off, stop, get up and move around, get something to drink. Distract yourself for at least fifteen minutes. Then set the timer for another 25 minutes. Return to the paper, and try to wrap it up.  Don't edit it until you've written it all the way through.  Once the timer goes off a second time, don't touch the paper again until tomorrow.  Then edit it one time only, and be done with it."}, {"instruction": "25 minutes doesn't sound like enough time, Doctor.  What about 40?", "input": "", "output": "Okay, 40. But impose these time restrictions on yourself. You can train yourself to work efficiently within self-imposed time limits. Try it, will you?"}, {"instruction": "That sounds like it might work.", "input": "", "output": "Let's mail this thing."}, {"instruction": "Here goes nothing!", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Fine, until my brother gives me shit for my spelling.", "input": "", "output": "Is that something he would do, really?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, he makes more mistakes than I ever would.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, it will be fine."}, {"instruction": "There's my grandmother.", "input": "", "output": "Great, Rachel.  Our next session will be March 3rd."}, {"instruction": "Two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "See you then. Take care, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "Better.", "input": "", "output": "You look very good."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Have a seat. So, how have you been?"}, {"instruction": "You already asked me that.", "input": "", "output": "I would like a bit more detail, if you don't mind."}, {"instruction": "School is going well. I'm actually enjoying its challenges. I can't say it's boring. By the way, thanks for changing my sessions to Friday. I don't have any classes on Friday this semester, and it should work out much better. And I'm sorry about missing another session.", "input": "", "output": "No problem. As I recall, you had two papers and two tests coming up last time. How did they go?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know what I was so nervous about. I guess it was because they were the first ones and I didn't know how I'd do. I aced the Anthropology test and got 88% on the other. The papers were pretty good, too, but I still have trouble writing and editing.", "input": "", "output": "Did you try taking a break from your writing every twenty or thirty minutes like I suggested?"}, {"instruction": "Those two papers I really sweated over. But I did so well on them, that since then, I haven't worried as much about writing. I guess my hardest class to prepare for is speech class. I'm not exactly in control over the outcome, you know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. A paper can be reworked, but a speech can only be edited in the planning stage. You just have one shot at the performance."}, {"instruction": "You said it. The teacher videotaped us last time. It was weird.", "input": "", "output": "Visual feedback can be revealing. What was weird about it?"}, {"instruction": "I fidget a lot. I kept doing something with my left hand on the podium. I found a place where the fake veneer was peeling away from the wood base. During my speech, I kept putting my fingernail into the crack and then pushing it back to mend it. It kept me from making eye contact--my teacher's pet peeve. I worked hard most of my life not to be noticed, but I have nowhere to hide when I'm up there at the podium.", "input": "", "output": "I don't want to embarrass you, Rachel, but you are dressed like you want to be noticed."}, {"instruction": "I didn't wear this to school, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You seemed to have put a a lot of effort into looking very sharp today."}, {"instruction": "I was just...how should I put it? Experimenting, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Maybe I wanted you to notice.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "You're the only person besides Gram that I talk to in a friendly way. And you're a man. And you help me and care about me. And I wanted to...oh, I don't know!", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, it's true--I like you and I want to help you.  And I always pay attention to you. But it's not the same kind of attention you were seeking, I think."}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "I'm concerned that you would go to this much trouble for me. This seems out of character for you. What was your experiment? What were you hoping to discover?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I wanted to find out if I was attractive to someone. To you. I wanted to see if anyone would notice me. I wanted to know if I could compete. It's all those things. Every day at school, I see people exude their sexuality. I don't feel right about doing that. I don't tend to act or dress in provocative manner. But I thought it would be safe to dress for you and see what you thought. Is it weird?", "input": "", "output": "No, it's not weird. I think you look very attractive and sexy."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "But it would be inappropriate for me or for you to sabotage the doctor/patient relationship..."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know. I get it. I guess if I passed the test with you, I might try doing this in school. I dress pretty dumpy most of the time.", "input": "", "output": "I am encouraged that you are showing confidence in the way you look. Now that you're in school, you have contact with a variety of people. And I'm glad you have more self confidence. But are you ready for the responses you are going to get?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I'll find out. I'm not going to do anything stupid like last time.", "input": "", "output": "You mean the incident two years ago?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  The stupid study buddy...", "input": "", "output": "The rape."}, {"instruction": "Whatever.", "input": "", "output": "You were raped. It was not your fault."}, {"instruction": "I'd rather not talk about this, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  But it sounds like we should work on this.  I think you might be having trouble accepting..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. I accept it. I just don't want to talk about it again right now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Rachel, does your grandmother help you shop for clothes? Is she actively involved in your decisions?"}, {"instruction": "She still thinks I'm just a kid, not a woman. We don't share that much together. We watch TV, movies...we watched the Academy Awards together the other night. As far as clothes go, I've never seen her in a dress, or dressed up even. She doesn't really have a clue. Why do you ask?", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes it's useful to have a woman's perspective and feedback. Magazines can give you ideas about what to wear, although I believe their content tends to be somewhat extreme. Are there any women in your classes that you might befriend?"}, {"instruction": "There are a couple of nice people in my poetry class who asked me to join a writers' group. Maybe I'll try it and start making connections with real people.", "input": "", "output": "I think it would be very healthy for you to spend time with new acquaintances. It's a good idea to join that writing group and see if there are people there with whom you can be comfortable. By going to school, you are putting yourself in situations where you can meet people. I think you can start making choices that get you involved. How does that sound?"}, {"instruction": "Not so bad. It sounds normal.", "input": "", "output": "It is normal. Sharing your life with friends is normal. Will you try it?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. Hey, my brother got that letter you made me send during our last session. He couldn't figure out why I wrote to say basically nothing, especially since I e-mail him all the time. I explained it to him.", "input": "", "output": "Do you share very much of our sessions with your brother?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. I tell him what I'm working on. I ask him questions like what he remembers about certain events. Also, I feel this need to keep my mother's memory alive, so we talk about what we remember about her. He said the same thing you just did--about getting a new life. I'm not ready for too many changes, but I think I'm ready to relate to people other than a sixty year old woman.", "input": "", "output": "Do you ever hear from your brother's roommate? What was his name?"}, {"instruction": "Evan? Michael talks about him a little because I ask. I still have a major crush on him. They are both supposed to be visiting on their way to Baja during Spring Break. They're going to stay at the house for a day or two. Gram's nervous.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Michael's always smoked pot, but he started doing a lot of coke right after my mom died. Living with Gram didn't work out for him. He kind of dropped out. He was cutting classes, getting stoned, getting an attitude. I felt like I didn't even know him for a while. I was afraid I'd lost him, too. Maybe that's why I had so much trouble for those two years. I was a lot worse back then. When I think back on it, I'm surprised I could even go to school. Anyway, that's all in the past.", "input": "", "output": "Your past is part of who you are today. Remember that it was not that long ago that you thought breaking one of your rituals would cause harm to your brother. How is the counting?"}, {"instruction": "I stopped that. After our last session, I started taking breaks from writing. Instead, I got up to pace. And I felt like an idiot. I actually laughed at myself as I starting to walk around my big bed. I stopped mid stride like I was daring myself. Instead, I tapped my foot four times: north, south, east, west, and that stopped it.", "input": "", "output": "You replaced one ritual with another?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think of it that way. The \"north south east west\" thing is what I do to stop a ritual. It works. I only have to do it once when I get the urge to count off my steps. Isn't that better than pacing? Now I just do it with my finger. I tap it out, and it's done. I make myself stop. It could be just as bad if I tapped and tapped and that became something I had to do twenty times or something. But I stop it.", "input": "", "output": "Did you find the relaxation tape I gave you a few months ago? I asked you to use it again. Have you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I started a yoga class. Now I do stretching and relaxing, plus what I guess you'd call meditation. Besides swimming, it's actually the best thing that I've ever found for this thing I'm plagued with. I'm serious!", "input": "", "output": "How do you think it helps?"}, {"instruction": "You find out what your body can and can't do. You challenge yourself to get to the edge, then go past your edges. It's a body awareness thing for me. You free your mind. One of the teachers talks about the ego. He tells us to leave it at the door before we come in.", "input": "", "output": "I would be out of business if I told my patients to do that."}, {"instruction": "So the better I get at yoga, the less I'm going to need you?", "input": "", "output": "I guess I should worry about that. Seriously, Rachel, I do not foresee keeping you as a patient for years. I've been honest with you all along during your treatment. I anticipate continued improvement with the possibility of moving you off of the medication at some point in the future. When that happens will depend on your progress. It depends on your goals. What would you like to be able to do in the future that you think would be difficult to do now?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I would...I'm not...", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "I want to be normal. I want to feel normal. I'm not sure what normal is, though. I feel desirable. I feel smart. But I'm lonely. I don't want to live with my grandmother, but I'm not ready to leave. I'm not as independent as I would like to be. I want a career. I want friends. I want someone to notice me, but I'm afraid.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. I want to help you have all those things, when you are ready--step by step. It sounds like you're meeting your current challenges well. I think it is important to continue to relax, whether through yoga or the tape. You need to try to make new friends and keep up with the medication. Keep your fitness level up. Are you eating right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "That's important. I noticed you lost some weight. Doctors recommend not more than one or two pounds per week of weight loss, though."}, {"instruction": "I've only lost twelve pounds since November. I'm not dieting, but I like the way I look, so I just don't get carried away anymore. I can say one thing for Gram--she's a great cook.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  We're out of time. Let's end this session with the hopes of not canceling another, okay? Our next one will be April 10th. Is that during your break?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but it won't be a problem. I'll be here.", "input": "", "output": "I will see you then.  Goodbye, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "What's up, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Rachel. You're in a good mood today."}, {"instruction": "One, I'm on Spring Break. And two, Michael and Evan are coming by this afternoon. Life is good.", "input": "", "output": "Glad to hear it. Do you have any special plans?"}, {"instruction": "Tonight? Just to ditch my grandma after dinner. Gram is doing a big food fest. A couple of the neighbors are coming over, too. It might be weird for us all to sit around the dinner table. Michael hasn't been home since he left two years ago.", "input": "", "output": "Does your grandmother entertain very often?"}, {"instruction": "Rarely. She has tables and food set up for bridge sometimes, but it isn't exactly party time or anything. Pretty boring. This probably will be too, except for Evan being there, of course.", "input": "", "output": "You're looking forward to his visit."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah! But I also want to see Michael. I worry about my little brother. I talk to him by e-mail regularly, but I don't really know how he's doing until I see him. Do you know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "No, explain."}, {"instruction": "He's always been good at bullshitting, excuse the language. He could really yank my mom around. He tried doing it with Gram, too, but she called him on it. They locked horns a lot. But he can be...what's the word for it? Dishonest. He's very clever. So seeing him in person is better; I can read him and see his facial expressions.", "input": "", "output": "That makes sense. Rachel, excuse me for changing the subject, but did you join that writing group you were talking about last time?"}, {"instruction": "Yes! That's what I wanted to tell you about. I inquired about the group the week after our session, and then I actually went to a meeting. I think it's going to be great for me. The hardest part was getting Gram to give me a ride. The meetings are at 7:00 p.m. and she is hooked on Jeopardy. But I talked her into it. See? I can be manipulative, too.", "input": "", "output": "How many people were at the meeting?"}, {"instruction": "Seven, but I guess usually there are more. It's at Mattie's house--she's the one who invited me. There were two other women and three guys. I felt pretty comfortable. During the session, the group comes up with some cool project for everyone to do for next time. Sometimes it's spontaneous, and sometimes it's from this book full of creative writing ideas. This week, we have to imagine a day which started by waking up transformed into the opposite sex and then write about our day in a new gender. I'm having fun with it. And that's just it--because we're there to share writing, I don't feel that weird sitting with strangers in someone's house. And two of the people there are in my speech class already, so we aren't complete strangers. But the writing is the focus.", "input": "", "output": "You said you were having fun with the writing. Does that mean that you don't feel the need to edit and reedit to achieve perfection?"}, {"instruction": "I don't feel like I'm going to be graded or judged. The purpose is different, so I'm more relaxed. Also, they really seem to like what I write.", "input": "", "output": "That's great. So what's bothering you?"}, {"instruction": "Excuse me?", "input": "", "output": "What's bothering you?"}, {"instruction": "Why are you asking me that?", "input": "", "output": "You're fidgeting."}, {"instruction": "I don't think anything is bothering me. I'm excited about my brother coming to visit, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "I see. How old is your brother?"}, {"instruction": "He's a couple years younger than me. He turned twenty in December.", "input": "", "output": "What do you remember about growing up with him?"}, {"instruction": "We were pretty close, especially when we were little because we shared a room. I think we kind of took care of each other, too. My dad was busy, and my mom was...well, you know.", "input": "", "output": "In an earlier session, you mentioned your mother driving you here and there when you were in high school. What was she like earlier? Do you remember her OCD symptoms when you were really young?"}, {"instruction": "How do you remember these things, Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "I take notes."}, {"instruction": "So you look at my notes before our sessions? What else did you dig up?", "input": "", "output": "Can you answer my question first?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. My mom spent a lot of time inside. When we were at home, she was always in the house. She used to open the window and call out when she wanted to check on us. I can still hear the sliding sound as the window opened and the slamming as it shut afterwards. She took us to Gram's house every other day. She stayed inside there, too, sitting on the rocking chair in the family room. I remember her rocking. She seemed pretty normal to us, until one of Michael's friends said something.", "input": "", "output": "What did he say?"}, {"instruction": "He asked why she was always rocking. Then kids at school teased she was \"off her rocker.\" That's when Michael started getting in trouble. He became a fighter. Back then, he didn't know how to talk about things, he'd just blast off. In second grade, he lost a tooth in a fight at recess. I couldn't believe it.", "input": "", "output": "How did your father react to the trouble?"}, {"instruction": "He interrogated my brother first. Then he went to the kid's house and talked to his parents or threatened them. That particular kid stopped teasing, I can tell you that.", "input": "", "output": "So you think your father might have threatened them?"}, {"instruction": "He had quite a temper. Michael's like that, too. But I think Michael is a lot smarter than my dad was...is.", "input": "", "output": "When is the last time you saw your father?"}, {"instruction": "About eight years ago. No, wait. He came to the funeral, summer of '95. Asshole.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He pretended to be grieving. He brought his little concubine with him. Big car, little class. He dyed his hair red. I couldn't believe it. It made him easier to hate.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you hate him?"}, {"instruction": "He ruined my mother. She was like a kept woman. He basically told her what to wear, how to act, when to wipe.", "input": "", "output": "You have a lot of anger towards him."}, {"instruction": "And there's more where that came from.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "I'm getting all worked up here. I wanted to end this session a little early because of Michael and Evan and all. Can't we do this another time?", "input": "", "output": "I prefer that we continue. This is only the second time I've heard you speak of your father with any detail. You said there was more. We still have thirty minutes. I feel like I'm getting closer to understanding your feelings toward your father. Would you please continue?"}, {"instruction": "There's more because I saw more. I heard more. I heard the animal in him grunting and going after my mom. She was so weak, but he just didn't leave her alone. She used to come out of the bedroom red-eyed and not really put together right. She wandered around the house humming and just kept walking. Maybe she was counting her steps. Now that I think about her walking around like that, it almost seems like she could have been counting. I walked in on them once. I was probably about eleven.", "input": "", "output": "It is common for kids to catch their parents having sex."}, {"instruction": "Not like that. I might be very naive, but that wasn't the kind of sex normal people have, I'm sorry.", "input": "", "output": "What did you see?"}, {"instruction": "She was on her hands and knees on the floor in a dress. At first, I thought she was looking for something under the bed, but there was something about the way he was moving behind her that told me otherwise. His pants were bunched up around his knees, and he had her hair wrapped around his hand, pulling so hard that her neck was twisted around. I'll never forget the way she looked when she saw me open the door. She looked wild.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He thought he could just take her whenever he wanted. He never thought about his kids, or her illness, or what it was like to be left behind.", "input": "", "output": "Who was left behind?"}, {"instruction": "Me! We all were, when he split.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, did your father ever try to do things to you that were not appropriate? Did he touch you where he shouldn't have?"}, {"instruction": "Why are you asking me all these questions? I didn't do anything wrong. He did!", "input": "", "output": "What did he do?"}, {"instruction": "He...yes, he touched me. God, I've never told anyone this!", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Rachel. It's okay to talk about it."}, {"instruction": "He made me touch him, too. He put my hand on his penis and...and he ejaculated.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, you didn't do anything wrong, he did. Did it happen only once?"}, {"instruction": "There was only one time. But it's enough to screw me up, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "It's more complicated than that."}, {"instruction": "I can't blame my OCD on him?", "input": "", "output": "Probably not, although your father clearly didn't help matters any. But it's better to find resilience than identify blame. You're a fighter, Rachel. You're stronger than you think. Your determination has brought you many successes. In many ways, you've struggled, taken risks, expressed your feelings, and moved on despite OCD."}, {"instruction": "I'll never stop hating him.", "input": "", "output": "Some people never get over their anger. I'm not sure you need to. It depends on whether the anger interferes with your relationships or your feelings of self worth. And we've started to explore some of those issues already."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Sorry about last time.", "input": "", "output": "Don't ever apologize for wanting to express your sexuality. You are a vibrant, attractive young woman. I have to caution you, though. Now that you've brought out some strong feelings about your father, it may trigger some other emotions, maybe even dreams. I don't want you to be surprised by them, just aware. It would be a very good time to get back to your journal. When patients dig as deep as you just have, other things may come up. I just want you to be kind to yourself. Remember that what he did was wrong, illegal, and unfair. You were an innocent child."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...", "input": "", "output": "You can't change the past, but you might change how you feel about it. How do you feel now?"}, {"instruction": "I feel okay. My little secret...I'm glad he isn't around. I don't have to think about it as much. I guess I could write a few things about it in my journal, just to process some stuff. Good idea, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Are you ready to end the session? I'm afraid it wasn't a short one, after all."}, {"instruction": "I guess so. What if I want to talk to you more about it?", "input": "", "output": "We meet in two weeks, but feel free to call. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Now I'm going to go and try to have fun.", "input": "", "output": "The psyche has a way of protecting itself. The thoughts and memories will come back, but probably later. You're going to be rather distracted tonight, right?"}, {"instruction": "Right. See you soon. Thanks, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you in two weeks.  Take care, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "You moved things around.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I did a little spring cleaning. What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "Um. I can't sit in my regular spot now.", "input": "", "output": "Does that make you uncomfortable?"}, {"instruction": "I'll get over it. Your desk is in the same place, but everything else has been moved around. What have your other patients said about it?", "input": "", "output": "You are the first one to say anything. I did it late yesterday afternoon."}, {"instruction": "I guess change can be good.", "input": "", "output": "Speaking of change, how is school going? Your writing group?"}, {"instruction": "I had a lot of fun with that writing task--the gender bender I told you about. Want to read it?", "input": "", "output": "Of course. But if you don't mind, I would rather read it later--I don't want to take time away from the session. Do you mind leaving it with me? I'll return it, of course."}, {"instruction": "No, it's okay.  I have copies that I made for the group.", "input": "", "output": "Great, thanks."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, I came out during the last meeting.", "input": "", "output": "Came out?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, about my OCD.", "input": "", "output": "That is a big step. What were the circumstances?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it was in my writing. The rituals came through even though I was writing as a guy.", "input": "", "output": "So you wrote as if you were an OCD male?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still performing rituals?"}, {"instruction": "Doesn't everyone?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but..."}, {"instruction": "I just fictionalized a few that I thought a guy would go through--like shaking it after you pee. My brother says if you shake it more than four times, you're playing with it!", "input": "", "output": "An interesting demarcation, but I want to backtrack a moment. You mentioned rituals, but I was under the impression that you had eliminated the repetition in most things, like grooming--that was one of your original OCD behaviors when I started seeing you. What is the status of your rituals now?"}, {"instruction": "I brush my hair about fifty strokes every morning and every night, but there isn't that feeling that it has to be done perfectly or I have to repeat it if I lose track of the number. Let's see, what else? I think I will always count the number of stairs as I climb. But now, I can just add whatever number of steps to it that will make fifteen in my head. Most steps are thirteen, like in people's houses. Have you ever noticed that?", "input": "", "output": "No, but it's not surprising. The height of a second story is usually determined by building codes, and the height of each stair is usually consistent. So, you do still count, but you no longer feel the need to correct or redo."}, {"instruction": "No. Besides, I can undo it with the north south east west thing.", "input": "", "output": "Show me that one again?"}, {"instruction": "Like this. It's sort of like crossing yourself, I guess, but I'm not a Catholic. Am I bad?", "input": "", "output": "No, Rachel. But like I said before, I'm concerned that you might be replacing one ritual with another, although the fact that you don't need to redo or spend an inordinate amount of time on a ritual is a good sign. Let's get back to your writing club. How was your OCD received?"}, {"instruction": "They were a lot like Evan, my brother's roommate. They just asked me a few questions. Everyone had seen \"As Good As It Gets,\" so they wondered about a bit about the soap and the checking of the locks on the door. Roger--the older guy in the group--was the one who figured out that the guy in my story had OCD. I was pleased that he caught on. I was kind of testing the group by putting OCD behaviors into my character. Roger looked straight at me and asked if I had OCD, too. He was right on.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I'm looking forward to reading the piece you wrote. By the way, did you think Jack Nicholson's character was a realistic portrayal?"}, {"instruction": "There is only so much a two hour movie can accomplish. But no, I didn't think he seemed like a true OCDer. We didn't really get to see him struggle with his illness before he was being asked to start changing. I can't imagine having a contamination thing and then letting a dog into my home, no matter what kind of favor I owed. Besides, did the director think that just putting a few bars of soap in the medicine chest is enough to convince us that he had OCD? Give me a break!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Now, I didn't mean to get off the subject of you, but I was interested in your opinion. So, how does it feel now that you have let your group know about your OCD?"}, {"instruction": "Good, really. After the others had left, Mattie said that she had no idea--she couldn't really tell anything by my actions. We talked for another half hour about it. Mattie confessed she gets really weird about unplugging her toaster, her coffee pot, the iron. I pointed out what you just said about OCD--it's about how much time the rituals take and if they interfere with your life. I also mentioned medication. I think it's helping.", "input": "", "output": "You don't sound so sure."}, {"instruction": "I guess I thought that it would eliminate my symptoms all together, that they wouldn't return. But right after school started, I started resorting to my old habits, and it got really ugly again. Then I was able to push them away. Will it always be like this--coming on strong and then retreating?", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid so. But it's a reflection of the swings of life, the highs and the lows. Stress comes and goes. The key to your treatment, as I have said before, is the addition of therapy to the equation. Medication plus therapy equals recovery. Let me show you something. I have a book I want you to see. Look at this appendix page about the lifestyle changes the author recommends. See anything familiar?"}, {"instruction": "We have done all of them! Except maybe this one, number three.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I think you have been willing to express your feelings. Certainly with me you have. I'm still puzzled about your relationship with your grandmother, you don't speak of her much. I forgot--how did your brother's visit and that dinner go?"}, {"instruction": "Michael was his charming self. Everyone was having a good time. Evan and Michael have been roommates for three years now, and they are so funny together. At dinner, us kids kind of monopolized the conversation. The neighbors were cool about it, though. After the tour of the house, Michael and Evan went out to visit some friends. I was bummed because they didn't invite me. I was back to just sister status. It was weird because Evan looked shocked when Michael said I needed my beauty rest. I think he might have been disappointed. I heard them come back around midnight.", "input": "", "output": "So they stayed the night at your house?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. It was a good thing too, because they were pretty blasted. One of them banged the bathroom door against the tub really loud. That was what woke me up. Then I decided to make my move.", "input": "", "output": "What move?"}, {"instruction": "I was wearing this T-shirt with a slit up both sides. I went to the bathroom and kind of posed there hoping to get caught. And fortunately it was Evan, my target.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He got another eyeful. It was pretty exciting.", "input": "", "output": "How did he react?"}, {"instruction": "He exhaled and at the same time said, \"Whoa.\" I'll never forget how he said it. Then he leaned against the wall in the hallway like he was falling. It took all I could muster to pass him on the way to my room. I surprised myself by looking back once I got to my door--he was still gaping at me. I said good night; so did he. That was it.", "input": "", "output": "You were teasing him?"}, {"instruction": "Someone could look at it that way. I prefer to think of it as a lucky coincidence.", "input": "", "output": "I must say, Rachel, that you are coming out in more ways than one. I cautioned you a couple of sessions ago about dressing to kill."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Men are easily stimulated visually and, while I commend you on your self expression, you have to be prepared for a reaction. You deliberately tried to sexually excite this young man. Are you prepared for the possible consequences?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, you sound like the father I never had. I appreciate it. You are the one who has helped me gain confidence. Please don't tell me to back off when I'm just getting started.", "input": "", "output": "Well, you experimented at home, and that's fairly safe. One wrong move and you'd have had your grandmother and brother to the rescue. They won't always be around, however. Enough said."}, {"instruction": "I enjoyed imagining what it would be like to be a guy in that paper I gave you.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. May I give you a writing assignment, too?"}, {"instruction": "Like what?", "input": "", "output": "I'd like you to write one page about what life will be like once you have recovered from OCD. You wrote about how it would feel to be a man for a day. Now write about your near future, maybe one year from now. Write about what you will be doing. I think it will give me an idea of your goals, and help you visualize them for yourself."}, {"instruction": "I'll try to squeeze it in. I might just write it in my journal. I've been writing more often, especially since I started in this writing group. A renewed hobby.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds good. Rachel, I want you to know that in the six or so months I've known you, you have made incredible gains. Continue to be strong, but just be careful."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doctor Balis.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "I feel pretty good. I survived two midterms and one paper. Another speech is due next week. I've been busy.", "input": "", "output": "Now I feel bad about the assignment I asked you to write."}, {"instruction": "Don't. It was an interesting diversion. You're in it. So is Evan. I still have this major fantasy about him. I got his e-mail address, and now I'm sending him stuff. It's not really that personal, yet. He's into games and jokes, and there're a lot of those on the Net.", "input": "", "output": "So your future includes Evan?"}, {"instruction": "This particular future does. Let me read you my poem first, though. May I?", "input": "", "output": "Poem? Certainly."}, {"instruction": "It's called \"Suicide.\" \"Can Rachel come out and play? Try it again. Can Rachel come out and play yet? Stop the tape. Try it again. Why is your mom rocking? Rewind the tape. This isn't right. Do it again. Why is your mom sitting in the car? Check the stove, Babydoll. Michael, did you lock the door? It has to be perfect. Momma has to check. Why is your Momma crying? Rewind. Be a good girl, Rachel. Checking. Checking. You can do better than that. Stop the tape. Get out of the car. Stop the car. I'm sorry, Momma. Fast forward.\"", "input": "", "output": "That's haunting."}, {"instruction": "By repeating certain phrases, I was trying to create a mood, a tempo.", "input": "", "output": "It's very revealing, even though I already know your story. It reads well out loud. And I like how you changed your voice for the little girl. It seems that there were many voices."}, {"instruction": "Do you think the title makes it too obvious?", "input": "", "output": "I think it would be a lot tamer without it. The reader wouldn't know how tragic it was. Have you shared it with your writing group?"}, {"instruction": "Not yet. Do you think I should?", "input": "", "output": "It's up to you. It might bring some questions and attention your way. Rachel, was there something that made you think about your mother?"}, {"instruction": "I think about her every day.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think about her suicide every day?"}, {"instruction": "No. It just needed to be said. My first poems are probably going to be about the most important things. I've been carrying around a lot of stuff. I've found writing to be a good way to let it out.", "input": "", "output": "What else are you carrying around?"}, {"instruction": "You know about my baggage: the OCD comes through in everything I write so far; my mom's suicide; trying to please when I was a little girl; my dad...", "input": "", "output": "Whom did you please?"}, {"instruction": "Excuse me?", "input": "", "output": "You said you were trying to please as a little girl. Whom were you trying to please?"}, {"instruction": "Everyone--my teachers, my mom, my grandma, my brother.", "input": "", "output": "Your father?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose even him. He was rarely happy with what any of us did. I kind of gave up trying. Also, I learned to fear him, for obvious reasons.", "input": "", "output": "Did any of the other people you mentioned appreciate you? Were your efforts ever acknowledged?"}, {"instruction": "I know my mom needed me. I was her sweetheart, her little helper. But sometimes, she didn't even seem to notice I was around. And other times, I think I was her only friend.", "input": "", "output": "Did she depend on you during her illness?"}, {"instruction": "You know what? I was her mom. That's how I felt. Who needed toys? I had a giant rag doll on my hands to take care of.", "input": "", "output": "Was she really that incapacitated?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, damn it. I had to hide my mother, cover for her for so many years. I didn't really get to be a kid. And Michael wasn't much help.", "input": "", "output": "You sound angry, perhaps even resentful."}, {"instruction": "I was robbed of some of my childhood. I worried about her so much. At one time she was so beautiful. Look at this.", "input": "", "output": "You're right, she is beautiful. Who took this picture?"}, {"instruction": "My dad. It must have been one of her good days. He was parading her around in her yellow dress to match the yellow T-Bird.", "input": "", "output": "Were you ever jealous of the attention your father gave her? What I mean is, do you feel like he should have given you more of his time?"}, {"instruction": "No! I didn't want to be around him. Anyway, it would be more accurate to say that my mom was jealous of me. She would always tell me how pretty I was and that I would make someone a good wife. I think she realized that I was more capable and responsible than she was. When she blew it, she blew it big time. So it was always a challenge to get the house and dinner taken care of before the tyrant got home.", "input": "", "output": "That is a lot of responsibility for a child to handle. I think it made you more resilient. But it probably contributed to your obsessions. You wanted to get things right. You developed a methodical system that you thought would guarantee a successful outcome and give you control over your life."}, {"instruction": "Yes, but it didn't turn out just fine.", "input": "", "output": "When the system let you down, your obsessions and compulsions doubled in force and necessity. When the rituals didn't work any more, you became desperate and added more and more complex steps. You began to lose track of the right way, because each time you got more and more desperate."}, {"instruction": "That's when Gram called you.", "input": "", "output": "At that point, the consequences and stakes got much higher. You conjectured that harm would come to those you loved. When harm did come--even though logic told you that your mother made her own choices--you blamed yourself."}, {"instruction": "There's no guarantee that the system will work.", "input": "", "output": "It was a house of cards, Rachel. The foundation was weakened. It wasn't you; it was the circumstances around you. You were a child. And now, you are just emerging from a world of pain and starting to live life for the first time."}, {"instruction": "God, I'm so lucky that my grandmother is able to support me and that she made me see you. I want to see you, now. I certainly didn't the first couple of times.", "input": "", "output": "It didn't take you long to accept therapy. You have been more willing than most."}, {"instruction": "I'm a bit fried.  Can we talk about something else?", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  How's school? Are you still doing yoga?"}, {"instruction": "Yoga is the best. Have you ever tried it?", "input": "", "output": "No."}, {"instruction": "First we go through a variety of poses to stretch, then sun salutations to warm up. Then we focus on shoulder-opening or back bends or something. Then we do Savasana, which is the reward at the end.", "input": "", "output": "Reward?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Remember the relaxation you did with me in an early session? You were trying to get me to rest my hands. I could barely sit still. The way you worked the imagery from one part of the body over to the other was the same thing we do in Savasana. We try to relax everything. It feels like a reward for all the hard work during the previous hour or so.", "input": "", "output": "You do yoga for more than an hour?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Now it's my turn to give you an assignment. Try it, Doctor. It costs about fifteen bucks a session--a lot cheaper than your rates!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I'm curious to see what you wrote about the Rachel of the future."}, {"instruction": "She's not very different. Her circumstances have changed, but not much else. Take a look. It's short.", "input": "", "output": "How about if you read it to me?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. \"Today my therapist--the thick-haired, oddly handsome Doctor Balis--asked me to predict where my life was going. He gave me an assignment (the nerve!) asking what I thought my future would be, only three hundred and sixty five days away. It's hard to say, but I'm going to try to project. I'm twenty-three. I'm about to finish up the classes required for my A.A. degree. I'm living in Sausalito, working and reading poetry at a small coffee shop. It's the same place where Evan plays guitar on Saturday nights. I do readings at a couple of the bookstores in the city once a month. I don't live with Evan, yet, but we spend every weekend together. I continue with my yoga practice and swimming, doing both at least three times a week. I belong to an OCD support group that meets weekly. I'm still taking Prozac, but I am not seeing Doctor Balis. I e-mail him regularly, more for me than for him. He is kind for writing back, but he never initiates the correspondence. My grandma moved back to Germany because her sister's M.S. required her care. I seem to be doing so well, and my brother and I are quite close, so she felt she could depart. She gave us each a big chunk of money, encouraged us to visit, hugged me once, and said, \"Goodbye, my Liebchen,\" as if it were the last time. The remnants of my disorder are counting steps, brushing my hair religiously, fidgeting with my hands. My obsession with numbers continues--maybe it's a math thing. My obsessions with my hair and nails continue--maybe it's vanity. The point is I control my OCD, not the other way around. Medication and therapy have helped--Doctor Balis was right. I'm very afraid of discontinuing Prozac. I'm afraid of going back. I barely recall the pain, but the memories of events are fresh, and I don't want to repeat them.\"", "input": "", "output": "It seems very realistic. How would you feel without your grandmother?"}, {"instruction": "She's pretty easy to live with. She lets me do whatever I want, drives me around, pays for everything. But I know that it will come to an end someday. She's sixty-five, pretty healthy, but her sister does have M.S., so the scenario might not be that far off.", "input": "", "output": "I wanted you to go through this exercise so that a few positive images would emerge. Goals, if you will. I want you to keep in mind the most tangible. Evan may not be a significant part of your life, but I'm sure that finishing school, writing, getting a job will be. The point is that you are seeing yourself successful and making it. And I especially like the part about you controlling your OCD, not the reverse. That was significant. I'd like to keep a copy of this, for future reference, if you don't mind."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Are you ready to end this session? It's about time."}, {"instruction": "It's fine with me. Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you in two weeks, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "You too, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Is school over yet?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, thank God. I just finished a paper for my anthropology class. Better late than never!", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I thought the semester would have ended by now."}, {"instruction": "It did. She let me sneak it in late. I had shown her the first half of it and she gave me a reprieve and an A. Cool, huh?", "input": "", "output": "How fortunate for you. You must have had a rapport with the instructor."}, {"instruction": "Carla is really nice. And her class has been fascinating, especially the way she teaches it. We read \"The Naked Ape\" by Desmond Morris. Have you ever heard of it?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  But I think it was over twenty years ago."}, {"instruction": "For two weeks, instead of meeting in a stale building, we sat in the quad outside and discussed it, section by section. She has a way of pursuing opinions that really makes you hang your butt out on the line. The conversation got pretty heated up every once in a while. It's sexy stuff, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "To be truthful, I don't recall. So you befriended the instructor?"}, {"instruction": "I guess you could say that. I'll probably have her again this summer for Human Sexuality. It's a required class. I'm taking it easy this semester with only nine units. Journalism, Art and the sex class. Also, I'm going to try swimming at the school pool.", "input": "", "output": "What prompted that idea?"}, {"instruction": "I want to see how I do with the contamination thing.", "input": "", "output": "You haven't had any incidents with that for awhile, have you?"}, {"instruction": "Not about swimming. Something new came up that I haven't told you about.", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "Well, I went into the bathroom at school and someone hadn't flushed. It was only urine, but just the look of the pale yellow water in the toilet bowl and the smell of someone else's pee made me dizzy. I thought, if I can smell it, then some of the molecules must have entered me. It's in me! I think I actually moaned out loud, because this woman looked at me really funny when I blasted out of there. I washed my hands and face and used tons of paper to dry off. Then I went into the hallway, found a drinking fountain and rinsed my mouth out. When I thought it was rinsed enough I drank about a quart of water. I still hadn't peed at this point.", "input": "", "output": "Would you describe this episode as a panic attack?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I was panicked all right.", "input": "", "output": "Then what happened?"}, {"instruction": "I remembered where a staff bathroom was and eased my way past some of the faculty offices without being detected. What a relief! I know the issue will come up again. How do I get past it?", "input": "", "output": "What is your fear based on?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think of it as fear, exactly. I don't ever sit on a public toilet when I pee. My mom taught me to squat above the seat. You have to have strong quads to do it, and it took practice to get it right. I don't like smelling it--even my own. I certainly don't want to see someone else's, unflushed, in a public bathroom. I don't want any chance of it splashing on me.", "input": "", "output": "By using public restrooms, you'll always run the risk of seeing or smelling someone else's urine. Let's work on this right now. Let's brainstorm some ways to keep the panic at bay. I'm thinking that you might find restrooms that are less used, not necessarily staff bathrooms, but perhaps one in a less popular building."}, {"instruction": "That's an idea. I'm not going to the extremes of wearing diapers or not drinking liquids.", "input": "", "output": "Should we discuss the biology of urine? It's basically sterile, you know. There are no diseases transmitted through urine from toilet seats. It sounds like you modify your use of public facilities so that there is no contact. I'm concerned that you felt you could absorb contaminated airborne particles. We're talking parts per million in which there could be no impact on your system other than a detectable odor. Having said all that, what other concerns do you still have?"}, {"instruction": "I just never know when or where this OCD is going to take me. I don't like surprises. I mean, obviously I've had this thing about toilets thanks to my mother, but to have such a reaction was kind of out of the ordinary. I go along feeling good about myself and then it slaps me in the face and says, \"Take that!\"", "input": "", "output": "I see it as twenty steps forward, one step back, in your case. Every day, every week, we all have conflicts that arise and then get resolved, over and over. I suppose it makes life more interesting to have highs and lows. I am not minimizing your struggle, Rachel. I think, at times, you will have to work at slapping your OCD into submission. Self talk is your best ally."}, {"instruction": "What do I tell myself? That it's not urine, it's jasmine I smell?", "input": "", "output": "I don't mean denial. If logic is ineffective, turn to the recognition that it's your OCD talking. It's an unreasonable little brat, Rachel. Talk it down, scold it, send it to its room if that analogy works for you."}, {"instruction": "I've had practice at being a mom. That should work. I could get into spanking!", "input": "", "output": "It's important to use these episodes as a learning tool, although I hesitate to call them episodes. They really don't come up that often, unless you aren't telling me everything."}, {"instruction": "I don't share every little detail, every little moment of self doubt. But this one was a biggie. I'll know how to handle the next one when it happens.", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned that you want to start swimming at the school. I'm sure the same issue will come up again. You'll get more practice at letting it know who is boss--or mom."}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "Any plans for the summer?"}, {"instruction": "Just school. I want to go up and visit my brother again. Evan has been quite communicative via e-mail. Carla has a \"Thank God It's Over\" party coming up that I might go to.", "input": "", "output": "Carla, your instructor?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Oh! Gram is going to Germany for two weeks in late July. I haven't ever had the place to myself so that should be interesting.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, is there anything else you'd like to discuss? We still have some time."}, {"instruction": "Not really. I could give you a manicure.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still doing that?"}, {"instruction": "Of course! Don't you notice my nails?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I mean, I knew you did your own. I..."}, {"instruction": "Come on, Doctor. I have files, clippers. I just need a towel, these tissues, and some warm soapy water. Try it!", "input": "", "output": "Well...why not? I'll be right back."}, {"instruction": "Cool!", "input": "", "output": "Did I forget anything?"}, {"instruction": "This is fine. Maybe you should scoot over to this edge of the desk. Just rest one hand in the bowl for a minute to soften up the cuticles. Any problem areas?", "input": "", "output": "I pulled at this hangnail yesterday and I keep worrying it. You might want to go easy on it."}, {"instruction": "Do you prefer a certain nail length?", "input": "", "output": "No. I'll trust you to decide."}, {"instruction": "Actually, I'll skip the trimming, since we don't have much time. I'll just file a little once I push these cuticles back.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't realize how relaxing this would be."}, {"instruction": "Dr. Balis, are you a virgin?", "input": "", "output": "Excuse me? Oh! Yes, this is my first manicure."}, {"instruction": "It's like getting a massage or a haircut. Any time you let someone work on you, as long as you trust them, it can be quite soothing. Morris brings up the grooming ritual thing in that book I was telling you about. It's a primitive need. You can start soaking that other hand now. Do you have any lotion?", "input": "", "output": "I think there's some right here. Yes."}, {"instruction": "I can tell you have a desk job. Your hands are so soft. You have another session coming up?", "input": "", "output": "No, not immediately, but I think that we should probably wrap this up pretty soon."}, {"instruction": "I have to do your other hand. I'll be quick. It's amazing how it all comes back to me, even though it's been awhile since I worked officially. Hey, I could give you a manicure while we do our sessions!", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that's a good idea."}, {"instruction": "Mind if I ask why not?", "input": "", "output": "It's a bit distracting. I would rather focus my complete attention on you and our discussion, wouldn't you?"}, {"instruction": "I see your point. I don't really care. If we ever have extra time again, I'd be happy to work on you.", "input": "", "output": "I appreciate the thought."}, {"instruction": "Just let me lotion you up and we'll be done. You don't look so relaxed any more.", "input": "", "output": "It doesn't feel professional."}, {"instruction": "I'm a pro, don't you doubt it, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Not you, me. I'm not sure it is appropriate."}, {"instruction": "It's a different kind of hand job. I wouldn't worry about it.", "input": "", "output": "I...I'll see you in two weeks, then?"}, {"instruction": "Same time, same place. Take care, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "What's up, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "Aren't I supposed to have a carrot in my mouth when I ask that?", "input": "", "output": "Funny.  I'm glad you're in such a good mood. How's school?"}, {"instruction": "It's a lot more relaxing because it's summer session. Guess what?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not very good at guessing."}, {"instruction": "It's just an expression. Anyway, I went swimming in the college pool.", "input": "", "output": "Great! How did that go for you?"}, {"instruction": "It took a lot out of me just to get to the edge of the pool. Hell, just being in the locker room was a big step. I went to the noon swim--a time when mostly staff goes. I practically had the whole pool to myself. I did see Carla there.", "input": "", "output": "I think you mentioned her last session..."}, {"instruction": "She was my former anthropology teacher. Now she's teaching my Human Sexuality class.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "When I saw her swimming, it got me motivated to get in. I mean what was I going to do--have a panic attack, turn around and retreat? I did my half mile, no problem. Once I got into the rhythm, it felt a lot like it does at home. Lap after lap. Pretty monotonous, but it gets me centered. That and yoga.", "input": "", "output": "So it went well."}, {"instruction": "Yes...", "input": "", "output": "Yes, what?"}, {"instruction": "The showers were kind of gross. Someone's bathing suit was on the floor, and there were empty shampoo bottles and trash here and there. I kept my flip flops on while I showered. Once I got the water temperature nice and hot, I didn't worry as much. Plus, I brought my own soap. The other weird thing was that there were people in there.", "input": "", "output": "Of course."}, {"instruction": "How many people do you shower with, Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Weren't there a few private showers?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't see them until I was already wet. Maybe next time. I'm just not sure I want people checking me out.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, women will usually not be too interested in staring at you. They don't like being stared at either. Well, at least that's how it tends to go in men's locker rooms."}, {"instruction": "I never thought about that.", "input": "", "output": "Did you see anyone looking at you?"}, {"instruction": "As a matter of fact, I did.", "input": "", "output": "How did it make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Self conscious. She was dressed and I wasn't. I thought she was doing her hair or something at the big mirror. But when I glanced in her direction, she was watching me.", "input": "", "output": "Staring? Glancing? Watching? Which was it?"}, {"instruction": "I think she's got an eyeful. She smiled at me in a way that gave me chills.", "input": "", "output": "Was it a come on?"}, {"instruction": "What's that? Do you mean was it like she wanted me or something?", "input": "", "output": "What was your impression?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe. It was Carla.", "input": "", "output": "The woman looking at you was Carla?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I guess she studies sexuality in and out of class.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Maybe she was doing research. I can tell she really enjoys discussing sex...I mean sexuality. I think she likes making people squirm as she talks about certain things. In the shower, she had the same kind of twinkle as she often has in the classroom.", "input": "", "output": "Would you say she's playful?"}, {"instruction": "I guess that's the best word for it. Maybe mischievous.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been to her class since the shower incident?"}, {"instruction": "No, the class meets Mondays and Wednesdays and...", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to do anything about it?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing. I'll pretend like it never happened. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she was looking at the clock; maybe she was staring at my tits. I'll try not to think about it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you have any more public restroom stories to tell?"}, {"instruction": "No. I found a sanctuary--I use the staff bathroom between my two classes, and I watch what and when I drink.", "input": "", "output": "So you're controlling your bladder. Sounds like you've figured out a way of avoiding the problem."}, {"instruction": "Isn't that what we discussed?", "input": "", "output": "Not exactly. Your OCD is still controlling you. What happens next time you find yourself in a public restroom that smells like urine?"}, {"instruction": "I can hold it, or I can find another one.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but you're avoiding the issue by running away from it. What do you think a person in control of the situation would do?"}, {"instruction": "Tell it who's boss.", "input": "", "output": "For example?"}, {"instruction": "They'd use the restroom anyway. I guess I can breathe through my mouth so I don't have to smell it. I can flush the toilet before I using it. And I'll never sit on the seat.", "input": "", "output": "You know just the right things to say. Do you think you can do these things next time?"}, {"instruction": "Normal people avoid things that are unpleasant. Why can't I?", "input": "", "output": "You can. However, this bathroom thing represents a much larger issue for you. If you can take some of the energy away from it by plowing through it, you'll be able to apply that energy to more important things. Do it for practice--to get yourself ready for the bigger battles."}, {"instruction": "I don't see any big battles coming my way.", "input": "", "output": "I do."}, {"instruction": "Like what?", "input": "", "output": "Well, a few things come to mind. Let's see, didn't you say that your grandmother is going to leave for two weeks this Summer? You will be completely on your own while she's gone. Also, some day, you may want to get intimate with someone. Contamination issues will probably arise in relation to sex."}, {"instruction": "Yes, but...", "input": "", "output": "Then have you ever thought of learning to drive a car? That would give you a considerable amount of freedom..."}, {"instruction": "And keep me away from a host of unpleasant situations involving gross public transit riders.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, well.  And what about work? Won't you be looking for a job eventually?"}, {"instruction": "I guess...", "input": "", "output": "These are only a few of the things you'll need to confront in the not too distant future. And there are others..."}, {"instruction": "Why are you doing this to me, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "A few sessions ago, you painted a charming picture of your future that included finishing school, working, and being with a man. I'll be reminding you of those goals over and over. Rachel, try not to avoid things that make you uncomfortable. Divide and conquer is a key to overcoming some of the handicaps of OCD."}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay. Point taken.", "input": "", "output": "Here you are. I really didn't mean to make you cry."}, {"instruction": "You make me feel like a little kid, so sometimes I cry like a little kid.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Rachel. Why don't we try an exercise? There is a bathroom just a few doors down the hall. It's really only my patients and I that have access to it. Why don't you..."}, {"instruction": "It must be so amusing to you to play Doctor...", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, I think..."}, {"instruction": "You're wrong.", "input": "", "output": "Do you remember when you were proofreading and editing until the middle of the night and you still couldn't let go? So we tried a little spontaneous exercise--you wrote a note to your brother and we walked together to the mailbox and sent it off without any corrections. Remember?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I remember. It made me very uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "This is the same technique. It's called exposure. It's a legitimate exercise. I sincerely apologize if I'm making you feel uncomfortable."}, {"instruction": "Uncomfortable?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry you're so upset, Rachel. Some of what I do as a therapist does smack of manipulation. It's like teachers who use rewards or negative consequences to change student's behavior. It's psychology. Sometimes it works."}, {"instruction": "Some of what you've done--these little exercises--have helped. But I don't see these...these exercises as anything more than just games. I've got to go, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I don't want to end the session like this."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't feel like giving you another manicure, if that's what you're thinking.", "input": "", "output": "I was thinking of showing you a web site I found a few weeks ago. I think you might find it interesting."}, {"instruction": "This had better not be...", "input": "", "output": "I had this bookmarked because I've been meaning to show it to you. It's an OCD message board. It's not a chat room, but there are quite a few regulars. Here. Take my chair. The list of posts is in chronological order. Just read through a few of these messages to see how others are dealing with OCD."}, {"instruction": "It's interesting, I guess. How come you never prescribed Anafranil or Zoloft for me? There seems to be quite a few posts about these drugs.", "input": "", "output": "Well, although they have differences, Zoloft, Anafranil, and Prozac are all serotonin reuptake inhibitors, so they're actually quite similar drugs.  In my evaluation, I concluded that Prozac was a better choice for you than the others, although either may have also been an effective choice.  Although Anafranil is an excellent drug for treating OCD, I think of it as a second line option because of its small, but significant chance of causing grand mal seizures.  Anafranil is an interesting drug because it was being used in Europe in the sixties and seventies but wasn't approved in the U.S. until 1990 or so because of its potential to cause seizures in about 1% of the people who take it.  If you hadn't responded to the Prozac, though, I certainly would have considered moving to Anafranil.  There're are other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, too, that work well for compulsive disorders--Luvox, for example.  But each drug has its problems.  Prozac seems to have worked quite well for you with no side effects that I'm aware of.  What you're currently experiencing with public restrooms and the like is the difficulty of making behavioral changes.  Your OCD doesn't have the grip on you which it had before.  It makes you much more independent and in control than you were before.  But I'm droning on and on.  Let me write down the address of this site for you in case you want to find it again."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry I blew up like that. I don't really know why my reaction was so strong.", "input": "", "output": "It's all right. You're allowed, once in a while."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Well, our time is up. Take care, Rachel. I'll see you at the end of the month?  Let's see, that'll be July 24th at 3 pm."}, {"instruction": "Yes, that's fine. I'll let you know how living solo is going.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Goodbye, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "Hi.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Rachel. How are you?"}, {"instruction": "Fine.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Hmm. You have a look..."}, {"instruction": "Do you mean I look like the cat that ate the canary?", "input": "", "output": "Something like that.  What's up?"}, {"instruction": "I have something to share.", "input": "", "output": "I'm listening."}, {"instruction": "I'm exploring my sexuality.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "With a woman.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I knew that's what you would say! You always do that when you don't want to reveal what you are really thinking.", "input": "", "output": "I want to give you room to talk about it."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Where do I start? We went out for beer after class with a couple of other people. They left. We stayed and had another. She said that her daily swim would be a challenge. I said not really, especially if we went to my house. Gram was...she's in Germany. So Carla followed me home. We laid in the sun, swam, talked...", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you were comfortable with each other."}, {"instruction": "She is easy to talk to. I have to admit that ever since she showed up at the school's pool, I've been thinking about her. That look she gave me was so intimate. It was like that time when Evan was staying at the house and I came out in the hallway in just a T-shirt. Instead of looking away, I dared to make eye contact with him--what a rush! I'm somewhat of a tease, I guess. Anyway, there I was laying face down by the pool, in the sun, wet with goose bumps, eyes closed. She started putting on some sun lotion, and then she rubbed some on me. I rolled over and things progressed from there.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have any problems being that intimate?"}, {"instruction": "I'll tell you about that in a minute. She was so sensual. I keep thinking about how her hands felt on me. It was all hands and fingers. There were a lot of firsts, if you know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "So you were able to relax and enjoy her touch?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Are you able to relax around her now?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't seen her since then, but I've talked to her on the phone. She's coming over again on Sunday. It's a really weird feeling.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's exciting but weird. She's a woman and...well, women and women aren't your usual combination. She's older; she's my teacher. And because Gram is gone, I feel like I'm getting away with something I'm not supposed to be doing. And we were outside in front of God and everyone! But as far as the contamination thing, it hasn't really been a problem yet.", "input": "", "output": "Yet? Do you expect it to be?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I felt safe. I think it was because we were at my place. The pool made it feel familiar somehow. And having the water nearby made it feel cleaner. Plus, we only used touch--there wasn't any exchange of bodily fluids. But if we were just on a couch or a bed, and if it involved something like kissing...well, I think I might have trouble with that.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, uh...", "input": "", "output": "Let me ask another way. Was cleaning up after the event something you just couldn't wait to do? Did you need to wash your hands right away? And was it ritualized at all?"}, {"instruction": "I washed my hands first, then I took a shower. Neither one was any different than it has been lately. There was nothing like what I did before I started therapy.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think kissing might generate the urge to wash or brush?"}, {"instruction": "Probably. And floss.", "input": "", "output": "You're giggling; that's a good sign. Rachel, personal hygiene is important to most people, especially when intimacy takes place. However, if you feel the need to repeat or ritualize cleaning and washing up, I want to know about it. This is one of those tests for you. It's much like becoming a student again, or swimming in the school's pool, or using a public restroom. By the way, do you know how to practice safe sex?"}, {"instruction": "With a man, yes. But this is a little different.", "input": "", "output": "Exchange of fluids is the key concept. Saliva is not known to be a carrier, but vaginal secretions and the commingling of them is where you will need to think about using a barrier."}, {"instruction": "We haven't discussed this. But since she teaches human sexuality, I figure she knows all about protection. I feel like the encounter with her was kind of like a milestone for me. It was my first successful sexual experience, you know? It felt good, really good. I was able to let go with her. But I don't know if I really want a relationship with her. It could get ugly. How do we maintain the teacher-student thing and be lovers at the same time? It kind of just happened, but maybe it shouldn't happen again.", "input": "", "output": "If you are concerned about your privacy and hers, you can be very discrete. How important is Carla's class to you?"}, {"instruction": "I need it to complete my degree.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'm just having doubts.  On one hand, I was able to let go and feel a great deal of pleasure. But then there are risks...", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps you could just wait and see what develops. I'm sure Carla has feelings about this, too. Open communication with her will help guide you."}, {"instruction": "What would my grandma say? And my brother? Am I a lesbian now, all of a sudden?", "input": "", "output": "I'd say that your sexual orientation is in flux, but I'd avoid labeling yourself after one encounter or even a series of encounters. As far as your brother or grandmother, this relationship may make them feel uncomfortable, threatened, or prejudiced."}, {"instruction": "I know some gay couples that keep very private lives--double lives, if you will.", "input": "", "output": "You'll have to think about all these issues if you pursue this relationship."}, {"instruction": "It's getting complicated.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still writing?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but not as much. The writing group disbanded for the Summer because people were coming and going. I miss it. It sort of kept me honest--kept me writing.", "input": "", "output": "This experience will provide something new to write about, won't it?"}, {"instruction": "Good idea! I should write a poem about it.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you'll share it with me. The poem you read to me earlier this year revealed a lot about you and your mother. I'd be interested in hearing new material."}, {"instruction": "The anniversary of her death is coming up next month.", "input": "", "output": "How many years has it been?"}, {"instruction": "It will be three years on August fourteenth. Poor mom.", "input": "", "output": "Where are her remains?"}, {"instruction": "She opted not to get cremated. I think my father was behind that decision. He wanted the world to see how beautiful she was even in death, except for her hands, which were gloved--they were always reddened from picking and rubbing.", "input": "", "output": "Did she ever go to a therapist?"}, {"instruction": "My father would never have allowed that. She would have had to do it on the sly. No, she went to her mother for therapy, if you can call it that. It was more like intensive care. Gram would baby-sit; Mom would vegetate. It makes me wonder what Mom was like when she was my age, dating and working. It's really hard to imagine. I could have ended up like her, maybe.", "input": "", "output": "Your grandmother probably recognized the symptoms that you and your mother shared. She directed you to me so they wouldn't be repeated, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "Probably. Oh, I meant to thank you for sharing that OCD site. I get a lot of feedback and information about peoples' struggles and doubts. It's usually reassuring to read what others say. Sometimes, though, it works the other way. One woman said she felt like she might pick up a knife and cut her daughter's hand with it!

So I think about this. It couldn't happen by accident. And it couldn't happen consciously. So it couldn't happen, right?", "input": "", "output": "Right. That's the doubting disease for you. You ask yourself, \"I could never kill my own child or my grandmother, or could I?\" The answer is, of course, no. But you feel guilty for even thinking these thoughts."}, {"instruction": "True.", "input": "", "output": "Therapists try to get OCD sufferers to first relabel the thought--recognize it as an intrusive thought not based on reality--then remember that it is the OCD thinking and not you. The third step is the hardest. You have to retrain yourself to ignore or work around these thoughts by redirecting them and performing another behavior that is useful and positive. Last, you need to learn to view these thoughts as having very little value, as being senseless. With enough practice and intervention, you'll have control."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Let's say I want to kiss someone, but I'm afraid of the saliva.", "input": "", "output": "Why are you afraid?"}, {"instruction": "Because of germs.", "input": "", "output": "You have to look at the reality behind that fear: is there a chance of getting germs through saliva?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Then you have to gather information about what germs it might contain and pass on to you. Are you afraid of getting a cold, a flu, or are you afraid of dying?"}, {"instruction": "It's something like that.", "input": "", "output": "Colds and flus are transmitted through saliva. One of the risks you take when getting close to someone is of getting sick. But the chances are slim that a kiss would lead to death. You can gather clues as to the general health of the person you are about to kiss and then decide whether it's worth it."}, {"instruction": "It seems a shame to take such a clinical look at foreplay, doesn't it?

I look forward to it.", "input": "", "output": "Once again, you are sounding very healthy."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "I guess we are finished for today.

Bye!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "Hi.", "input": "", "output": "How are you?"}, {"instruction": "I almost canceled again today.

I'm not doing that well.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say that?"}, {"instruction": "I just got back from the memorial service for my mother. Today was the anniversary of her death--three years. It was pretty intense. I'm glad we did it, but it brought out a lot of emotions both good and bad.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Michael, Gram, and some other friends were there to honor her.

I held it together until near the end, until the song went, \"Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure, and I know they'll be no more tears in heaven.\" I made the mistake of looking at Gram and lost it. The one thought that makes my mother's death okay is that she is no longer suffering.", "input": "", "output": "There is some comfort in that."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, speaking of suffering, I'm having trouble. I might have to stop seeing Carla.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I can't get past my contamination thing. The fact that she seems willing to continue makes me feel even worse. She says she understands, but how can she? I'm not sure anyone can comprehend this OCD curse. It's a nightmare. It sucks.", "input": "", "output": "I can hear your anger and frustration, Rachel. What happened with Carla?"}, {"instruction": "Remember in our last session, we had a discussion about kissing? Well, I tried letting Carla kiss me. That was last Friday, which was why I didn't show up for our session. I'm sorry I didn't call. Anyway, she tried to kiss me. I heaved. I couldn't handle it. I told her it was something I ate, but she knew I wasn't being truthful. She pushed her way into the bathroom while I was cleaning up. That's when I came out to her. I told her about you, and therapy, and Prozac. I told her about my washing rituals and how I thought I was getting better. But...", "input": "", "output": "You are getting better."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, right.", "input": "", "output": "You have shown a lot of courage in the risks you've taking lately. However, as you face new situations, you relinquish control, and that is when you are most vulnerable. You might have to learn to flow with the unpleasant sensations until you become less anxious. That's not an easy thing to do."}, {"instruction": "I'll say. Why did it make me gag, though?", "input": "", "output": "Your mind convinced you that it would make you ill, so your body followed suit. Rachel, I'm not sure that this reaction is enough to stop developing your relationship with Carla. I..."}, {"instruction": "She didn't seem to mind the ugliness of the episode. In fact, she still wanted me.", "input": "", "output": "Did you try to continue?"}, {"instruction": "She was so patient and open, listening and asking careful questions. I calmed down enough to think about how I could refocus.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I hopped into the shower.", "input": "", "output": "Good replacement behavior."}, {"instruction": "And do you know what? She joined me. I'm really glad she did, because I regained some of my confidence.", "input": "", "output": "But you still have doubts about being with her?"}, {"instruction": "In my worst moments, yes. We can't even kiss, for Christ's sake!", "input": "", "output": "\"Can't\" is a strong word. There is no reason why someday you won't be able to kiss. Kissing is a very intimate act, but it's not the only one. I think what's more relevant is: are you able to let her kiss places other than your lips?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes! It seems like in the shower, I'm able to let a lot of things happen. At least that's how it worked out the other night. Sometimes, I feel like I am her little sexuality experiment, like she is studying me. I've been mostly the receiver, if you know what I mean. She seems content with that, for now. I think of things I'd like to try with her, but I'm afraid.", "input": "", "output": "She could be your little sexuality experiment, too. You laugh, but I'm halfway serious. It's just something to think about. Let's go over some of your fears. Would you say that contamination is number one?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. But I'm also afraid that I might not be able to please her.", "input": "", "output": "She will probably help you with that. It just takes good communication."}, {"instruction": "I'm afraid that if I open the floodgates, so to speak, she might insist on something that makes me uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "And you fear that she wouldn't listen to your objections?"}, {"instruction": "That doesn't sound like her, does it?", "input": "", "output": "Not from what you've said so far. But I can understand why you would be apprehensive. Rachel, I think some of the fear you're experiencing exists in all new relationships. As you explore intimacy, you'll find out what feels right to both you and your partner. It's a good opportunity to express what you like and don't like. Take advantage of Carla's willingness to listen."}, {"instruction": "Maybe you are right. It could be that we are just two people getting to know each other. I'm curious about her, too.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, do you want to be able to kiss her? We can work on that if it's important to you."}, {"instruction": "It isn't really high on my list. It just upsets me that I found something else that I'm not able to do.", "input": "", "output": "Not yet."}, {"instruction": "Right. Obviously, we were able to get around that. She really knows how to...well, never mind. What I want is not something you can help me with.", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "I want to go public with her.", "input": "", "output": "Showing affection in public?"}, {"instruction": "That too. I want to tell people about her. I want to hang out with her at school. I can no longer just be a student around her. Here I was in her sexuality class, and she was talking about the clitoris and how some female hyenas have such big ones that they look like penises. And I was squirming and throbbing in my seat thinking about the things she did to me the day before.", "input": "", "output": "I can see how that would be distracting."}, {"instruction": "I feel like she was talking to me and me alone. It was like she was letting everyone else eavesdrop while she tortured and teased me. One day, we were both so worked up after class, that we could hardly make it to my house without ripping each other's clothes off. That was a good session! But I don't know. I just don't like the feeling that I have to hide. It is hard enough coming out about OCD. Now I'll have to come out as a lesbian, too?", "input": "", "output": "Keeping secrets takes a lot of energy and maintenance. How does Carla feel about going public?"}, {"instruction": "Do you know how some people have a work persona, but then when you get to know them socially, they are totally different? She doesn't seem to be one of those people. I always see students hanging around her. She is just a strong, confident person. I don't think anyone would be able to guess about us. But I'm not sure she would care if people knew.", "input": "", "output": "She must have tenure."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Rachel?"}, {"instruction": "What if she dumps me?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "What if I'm just her current plaything? What if I'm her naive little semester fling? One in a series and all that. God! I would freak!", "input": "", "output": "What brought these thoughts to the surface?"}, {"instruction": "I'm just wondering and worrying. It's what I do best, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Is Carla a lesbian?"}, {"instruction": "Haven't you been...isn't it obvious?", "input": "", "output": "What do you know about her history? Has she ever been married? Are you her first female lover?"}, {"instruction": "We didn't get that far. I think she knows more about me than I do about her. Our relationship is kind of built on sex. The first time we really talked was when I spilled my guts, literally and figuratively!", "input": "", "output": "Good pun. Seriously, though, you may be the first woman she has ever been with. And there's a possibility that you'll end up dumping her. Besides, from what you've said so far, except for the kissing incident, it sounds like you have enjoyed being with Carla. You have good sex, you're able to relax, and you opened up with someone in some really healthy ways. Think about what you have gained from knowing Carla."}, {"instruction": "Wouldn't this make being dumped just that much more tragic?", "input": "", "output": "You can use the experience as a stepping stone to better relationships. Maybe she is doing you a favor. But it sounds to me like she genuinely cares about you and you have no reason to doubt your friendship."}, {"instruction": "Except for this doubting disease with which I seem to be afflicted. I guess I can talk to her.", "input": "", "output": "During our last session, you mentioned wanting to make a connection with someone, wanting to know someone spiritually and physically. Haven't you done this with Carla?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but I'm not ready for it to end.", "input": "", "output": "Then make the most out of it. I hate to repeat myself, but there are many risks in getting to know someone. Getting rejected is, unfortunately, one of them. Is Carla worth the risk?"}, {"instruction": "So far. I really, really like Carla. She's allowed me to open up a vault that's been sealed for a long time.", "input": "", "output": "Keep that in mind. Did you get a chance to write since our last session?"}, {"instruction": "No, I've been too distracted. I have a new hobby. Her name is Carla.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. What about your yoga practice?"}, {"instruction": "I do it on my own now, at home. The class is pretty expensive. Gram was complaining about it, especially because she was pinching pennies for her trip to Germany.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was pretty fun being alone in the house. I could get used to it, except it's way too big for just one person. It always seems kind of empty without Michael and Mom around.", "input": "", "output": "Do you ever think about moving out?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I also think about working again, but not as a manicurist. I see your nails have deteriorated, by the way.", "input": "", "output": "By contrast, yours are looking the best I can remember, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I might start looking for a part time job, something at the college would be perfect. I'll let you know.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you will. It's time to end the session, unless you have something else?"}, {"instruction": "I'm done. And Doctor? I like what you said about stepping stones. It makes my future sound like it's going to get better.", "input": "", "output": "It will, Rachel. Count on it."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "See you on August 28th. Take care."}, {"instruction": "Hi.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Rachel. Please sit down. Hmm. Are you okay?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'm not. I'm sinking. I'm in deep again, and I don't know how to get back out. I'm sorry. I'm not making much sense.", "input": "", "output": "You are making enough sense for me to know that you're struggling hard with OCD again. I'm sorry I had to miss our last appointment. What's going on, Rachel?"}, {"instruction": "Where should I start? Carla and I aren't seeing each other anymore. Maybe it was inevitable. Remember when I asked, \"What if she dumps me?\" I guess I kind of knew even then that it might not work out. Maybe I couldn't give her enough of what she needed, or she got tired of waiting. Maybe the novelty wore off. But there are other things going on, too. My grandmother and I have been at odds with each other since she returned from Germany.", "input": "", "output": "I want to go back to Carla for a moment. Do you feel like you got closure with that relationship?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "Did you and Carla come to an understanding as to why you won't be seeing each other?"}, {"instruction": "I just told you why.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but it sounded as if you weren't sure."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure that I have sexual limitations. I'm sure that she's going to replace me as soon as she finds a new guinea pig. I'm sure that I'll be reminded of my failure every time I see her or hear her name.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, I'm going to take each of the issues you just mentioned and turn them around to give you another way of looking at them. First, instead of thinking you have sexual limitations, remember that you were able to explore intimacy and gain trust with a lover. The last I heard, you were enjoying the physical relationship with Carla."}, {"instruction": "There were things I couldn't do, though.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but let's focus on what you were able to do. You also mentioned Carla finding someone new. I'm quite certain that, in time, you'll find someone new, too. Carla could have been your stepping stone in exploring intimate relationships. The experience you gained with her will help you in the future."}, {"instruction": "That's a thought that horrifies me at the moment.", "input": "", "output": "I understand, but that will change. I promise. I also want you to be very clear that you didn't fail in this relationship. You triumphed in many ways. You explored intimacy, developed trust, revealed your OCD to a new person, and you got a lot of enjoyment out of the experience."}, {"instruction": "But it hurts like hell right now.", "input": "", "output": "There is a good expression: \"Suffering is the great motivator of growth.\" It might hurt now, and you might feel like you're in a tailspin, but that's what most of the songs and poems ever written are all about. Most people feel bad when a relationship ends. It's not just your OCD that makes you feel bad."}, {"instruction": "No pain, no gain?", "input": "", "output": "Exactly. And your ability to see a lighter side in the midst of tough times is refreshing."}, {"instruction": "I amaze myself, too, but not in ways that you'd agree with. I'm amazed that I put myself in a vulnerable position. And now I have to pay for my stupidity.", "input": "", "output": "You have to learn to see the positive results of this relationship."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry. It's not that I really feel stupid. It's just that I need a way to stop from feeling used. I feel so naive. I guess I need to learn from my mistakes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What would you want to change if you could?"}, {"instruction": "I might have slowed down. First, we have a couple of beers, and the next thing I know, she's in my pants...or in my swimsuit, to be precise. But I have to admit, it felt good getting carried away.", "input": "", "output": "That's what I'm looking for, Rachel. It felt good--that's a positive way of looking at this experience. Stepping stones, not quicksand."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, this is all well and good to be sitting in your office, saying the right things, processing on a cerebral level. But what do I do when I start stewing about it at home? Look at this.", "input": "", "output": "Oh no. I'm sorry. I should have been there for you. You could have told my service, and they would have gotten me in New York. I..."}, {"instruction": "It's too late. I was sort of in a trance. Pretty ugly, huh?", "input": "", "output": "I didn't notice your hair until you pointed it out."}, {"instruction": "I have a lot of experience hiding my bad habits.", "input": "", "output": "Pulling your hair out like that is not..."}, {"instruction": "Whatever. Part of the problem is that school was out for the Summer, and I had too much time on my hands, so to speak.", "input": "", "output": "Do you remember what lead up to the hair pulling? What thoughts did you have prior and during?"}, {"instruction": "I was just sitting at my desk. I'd been playing Hearts on the computer, when I started thinking about how it was so much work to try to be normal. I felt deserted--no school, no Carla, no more solitude, no job. And then I started to think about all the things I wasn't able to do in my relationship with Carla. Maybe I didn't deserve to be with someone. I still wonder if I was too selfish. Whew! True confessions.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And when did you realize that you were pulling your hair out?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I consciously stopped for a moment to get out my journal. I opened it up to a blank page and actually tried to come up with some things to write down to divert myself from negative thinking.", "input": "", "output": "That's good."}, {"instruction": "But I got writer's block and started thinking and pulling again.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What did you do with the hair you pulled out?"}, {"instruction": "I looked at it, found the end with the root, and then--this is going to sound really weird--and then I pressed it onto a piece of paper using my fingernail. I \"glued\" it to the paper at one end. Eventually, I had lined all the hairs up in rows.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "That's what I used to do before, only I worked in front of a mirror and stuck them to the mirror. When I was done, I pulled them off, folded them in a piece of paper, and tossed them. When I'm in front of the mirror, I can see the gray hairs and the wiry ones. Those are the ones I'm after--the less than perfect ones.", "input": "", "output": "But your hair loss is all in one area, above your temple."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, have you pulled hair from other places?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "My pubic hairs were all gone a while back. But you're the only one who knows about that.", "input": "", "output": "So you are not aware of the moment you start to pull your hair. Did you try to stop when you realized what you were doing?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. The attraction of pulling is hard to describe. It feels cleansing, in a way. Maybe subconsciously, it's like lightening my load, hair by hair. Also, I'm trying to get rid of imperfection--the imperfect hairs. There's definitely a pleasurable sensation that goes along with it. Even the prickle of a hair root popping out is satisfying somehow.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you for giving me the details. I know you see the drawbacks in succumbing to the desire to pull out your hair. We need to get you back on track. I see this is a temporary reaction--because your relationship with Carla ended, and because you had extra time, you somehow found comfort in an old ritual. But I think I have some ideas on how to help you."}, {"instruction": "Are you going to increase my meds?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think it would be an effective option at this point. No, my proposal is going to require more work than that but I think it could be more effective."}, {"instruction": "I'm listening.", "input": "", "output": "Your hands are a big part of how you express your OCD. They are almost a weather vane, telling of an approaching storm or clear skies. We need to find something for your hands to do while your mind wonders that's a lot less destructive than pulling your hair out. We need a constructive activity to keep your hands busy."}, {"instruction": "Like what?", "input": "", "output": "In many cultures, people carry beads or stones in their pockets to play with when they worry about something--the worry stones. There are other things that work to the same effect. Here's one."}, {"instruction": "A Koosh ball?", "input": "", "output": "The one and only. But a tennis ball, stress ball, or even Silly Putty would work. You knead it, squeeze it, manipulate it instead of pulling your hair."}, {"instruction": "That could work at home, but what about in public?", "input": "", "output": "A rabbit's foot on a key chain, quarters in your pocket, knots in a hankie, even twisting the ring on your finger are all ways to transfer agitation. Smoking is the classic example, but I'm not going to recommend that."}, {"instruction": "Choke! I guess I can try something like that. I like the texture of those gummy plastic toys that are so abundant now. I played with them before. They are kind of icky, though. But if I am not aware of the moment when I start to pull, how do I stop myself and transfer that energy into a worry toy?", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned that you sat at your computer one time you started, and you used to pull hair in front of a bathroom mirror. The idle times are probably when you are most vulnerable. Your mind drifts, and before you know it, your hand is in your hair. If you always try to have a purpose before you sit down to relax, you might be able to decrease the down time. When you finish an activity, get up and move on to your next purposeful act. Also, try to have the replacement items nearby. Have several of them to turn to when you need them."}, {"instruction": "A whole arsenal of new toys.", "input": "", "output": "It will require a conscious effort. Awareness is the first step. One day at a time."}, {"instruction": "You sound like you are reading bumper stickers.", "input": "", "output": "Sorry for the clich\u00e9s. You do know what I mean, don't you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "One more thing, you can make your hair unavailable."}, {"instruction": "Shave?", "input": "", "output": "That may sound extreme, but some people with trich do resort to a that option."}, {"instruction": "Trick?", "input": "", "output": "Trich. Trich is short for trichotillomania, the act of hair pulling."}, {"instruction": "That's weird. I didn't know there was a name for it.", "input": "", "output": "Scientists like to name everything. But you can wrap your hair up or tie it back. You can put it up into a towel during the times when you are at your computer."}, {"instruction": "I was only wearing this scarf to cover up the bald spot, but I guess I can wear it to protect myself.", "input": "", "output": "That's it. And I want you to notice something for our next session. Pay attention to the thoughts you're having that lead to the desire to pull. Also notice if you feel tension while resisting the urge to pull. Tell me for how long you were successful--days, hopefully, but time may go slowly because I've asked you to focus on this one thing."}, {"instruction": "I haven't had homework for awhile.", "input": "", "output": "When does school start up again?"}, {"instruction": "Next week. I'm starting to lose the motivation. But I'm afraid of what I'll become, if I don't go to school.", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be at your best when you are busy. I encourage you to continue school, yoga, swimming, writing. Perhaps you can take up knitting. That's a good busy hands activity and productive, too. And didn't you say you play the piano?"}, {"instruction": "I can, but I don't.", "input": "", "output": "It seems like a perfect activity for those hands."}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it. The piano is just sitting there collecting dust.", "input": "", "output": "So, which of my suggestions are you going to try?"}, {"instruction": "I don't mean to be disrespectful, but my grandmother is paying you big bucks, and you are sending me away with a prescription for Koosh balls, a buzz cut, and a rabbit's foot? What's up with that?", "input": "", "output": "I thought you understood..."}, {"instruction": "Hold on to your doctorate! I'm just kidding! Seriously, every time I meet with you, I feel like there is a shred of sanity left in me. I take your input to heart. It's like in yoga classes, the instructor can make an adjustment or say something in a way that makes me understand the pose just a little better. Some of the things you say I replay over and over. You've really helped me.", "input": "", "output": "You almost had me there. I appreciate the feedback, Rachel. I don't always feel successful."}, {"instruction": "Especially considering my record!", "input": "", "output": "Rachel..."}, {"instruction": "I know, be positive. It's my weird humor coming out.", "input": "", "output": "So, I'll see you in two weeks?"}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel! How are you feeling?"}, {"instruction": "Better, I guess. I look awful, I know.", "input": "", "output": "You don't look well. Have you seen a doctor?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I've got all kinds of lotions and potions to fix me up.", "input": "", "output": "What have you been prescribed?"}, {"instruction": "Let's see. I got Kenalog for my cold sores, some kind of steroid cream for my psoriasis, Prozac, of course, and antibiotics for the sinus infection. It seems like when the weather changed, my body freaked. It's still protesting. I might have to make this session short, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Let's just catch up a little, then we'll let you get back home to bed. How does that sound?"}, {"instruction": "Good.", "input": "", "output": "So, you had a cold, and now it turned into a sinus infection?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Allergies are a late development in my life, lucky me. At first, I thought the sore throat was just drainage, but then it turned into a full blown cold. I missed a couple days of school. Then I got the cold sores, then the sinus thing. I'm tired, but I've been hanging in with the school stuff. I'm only taking six units this time around, thank god!", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about the psoriasis."}, {"instruction": "Oh, that. Well, off and on for years, I've had bouts with it. When I was about twelve, I had to wear these gloves at night while my hands were lathered up with cream. My nails almost fell out. This isn't so bad. Just in time for Halloween, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes, psoriasis crops up due to stress. Do you feel like you have more demands on you than usual?"}, {"instruction": "I think I told you that my grandma and I hadn't been getting along that well lately. She's been really sweet since I got sick, but before that, we got into a few yelling matches. She thinks I'm spoiled and ungrateful. She's right. I know she wants to move back to Germany, and I'm keeping her from it. She's restless, and I'm needy. She's kind of stuck until I get my act together.", "input": "", "output": "And, of course, there's your school."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "How is your semester going?"}, {"instruction": "So so. I feel kind of out of it. I'm taking a poetry class, that's the best. It starts first thing in the morning. The teacher is young, and energetic, and romantic. He makes it fun. Then I have a biology class. It's one of those huge lecture classes. And then there's lab two days a week. That's about all I can handle right now.", "input": "", "output": "Are you keeping up with the homework?"}, {"instruction": "Of course. Did I tell you that I have a 3.6 grade point average?", "input": "", "output": "No. That's great, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "Actually, I got all A's. I wasn't as successful a couple years ago, so my old C's brought the average down.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you stayed with school. I think you're a person who likes to learn, and you do better when you're involved."}, {"instruction": "I do; I am. I have felt out of it for so long. School gives me a way to enter the real world again.", "input": "", "output": "Some people go to school to escape the real world."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's more real than the rest of my life has ever been.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it's good for you. Keep up the good work, Rachel. Now, according to my notes, you were going to try to reduce the hair pulling."}, {"instruction": "I armed myself with toys, like you suggested. I had no idea there were so many feelies on the market.", "input": "", "output": "\"Feelies?\""}, {"instruction": "That's what I call them. It seems their only purpose is to provide people like me with something to do with our hands. It was fun shopping. I can't say I manipulate them that much. My hands are suffering again, as you've probably noticed. They are a mess.", "input": "", "output": "I can remember your hands were so well manicured at one point. Can you turn this fidgeting into something more positive? Instead of picking at the nails and skin, can you nurture your hands?"}, {"instruction": "I wish I could just leave them alone altogether. I even dream about my hands. I can see them, just in front of me, typing on the keyboard, writing, wringing something out, dialing, pointing. I bet they twitch all night long. It's like they never get to rest!", "input": "", "output": "And the hair pulling?"}, {"instruction": "I'm still doing it. For about two days after our last session, I caught myself each time I did it. I even wrote down what I had been thinking just prior to the act, but it didn't last. God! I'm always picking at myself! I wish I could just stop!", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, you've been struggling for a while now, and I see additional manifestations of your OCD that concern me. I think I would like to increase your dosage of Prozac. What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "Really?", "input": "", "output": "In fact, I would like to try doubling your dosage to forty milligrams a day. It will be a year in November since you've started taking Prozac. And it's not uncommon to adjust the dosage periodically. I think it might take a certain edge off, perhaps even reduce some of your anxiety. I would also like, with your permission, to speak with your regular physician. I'd like to coordinate our efforts so that we could both work on helping you. My concern is mainly with the psoriasis. I want to make sure that our treatments are compatible. Would you object?"}, {"instruction": "Not at all. His name is Doctor Malcolm. Gram can get you his phone number. Should I expect to feel different because of the increased amount of Prozac?", "input": "", "output": "In general, Prozac can cause sleeplessness, sometimes headaches and weight loss. But you've responded so well to it, that I don't anticipate any adverse effects."}, {"instruction": "I'll try it. Will it help me feel less agitated?", "input": "", "output": "Is that how you feel now?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. It's like I'm itching from the inside out. And it's not just physical, it's a mental itch, too. I want to act on my ideas, but I keep holding myself back. I'm ready, but not quite ready. I'm very restless, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Yes, this should help. Technically, it should suppress intrusive urges. But you'll have to be more diligent about therapy, Rachel. Medication alone won't give you relief."}, {"instruction": "To tell you the truth, I'm already relieved a little. I'm not so good at hiding my OCD these days. You've helped give me the courage to push onward, but sometimes, I look at myself in the mirror, and I can't believe I'm going out in public--scarf on my hair, cream on my hands, rabbit's foot dangling from my backpack, my grandmother driving me to school. What a nerd!", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, I know you have moments when you feel powerful, and brave, and on top of things. Remember that Rachel Tanner when you feel weak. Try, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Is this a good time to end the session, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. We can end here."}, {"instruction": "Good. I'm tired, and Gram is probably sick of waiting for me.", "input": "", "output": "Well, our next session will be two weeks from now, on October 30th, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sounds good. Thanks, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome. Goodbye, Rachel, take care yourself."}, {"instruction": "Finally, uh? It was like all the bugs ganged up together and said, \"Let's dog pile on Rachel!\" I don't quite feel a hundred percent yet, but I'm so much better.", "input": "", "output": "It shows. Did you make your big decision yet?"}, {"instruction": "Yes! If I seem worked up, it's because I'm excited about moving in with my brother. I think it's going to work out. I love the house and the neighborhood in Sausalito, especially when the tourists are gone. I have to live in the laundry room, but we are going to make it cozier. Besides, the dryer warms the place up, and I'll have my own sink. And I can come and go through my own door. And it has a great view. I took your advice and looked at all the positives.", "input": "", "output": "There were fewer unknowns with that choice than with moving to Germany with your grandmother."}, {"instruction": "Exactly. And there's another benefit with this choice...", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "Evan. I can get to know him better.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "There you go being neutral again.", "input": "", "output": "I don't want to influ..."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry about it. I'll just keep talking. I feel like I'm about to do some growing up, somehow. I'll probably have to start working again. There are salons where I could do manicures, but I don't know if I have the right image for those high-end shops over in Marin. An artsy fartsy coffee shop might need help, then I could dress like the slob I usually am. I don't think I could handle waiting tables like Michael does. Rent is going to be cheap. Michael said my share would only be $150. Gram said she'd allow $600 a month for living expenses, but part of it's for school. If I quit school, she'll only give me $450. It's her little incentive, manipulation, whatever you call it. That's how Germans are, \"Work makes you free,\" and all that.", "input": "", "output": "How is school going?"}, {"instruction": "Fine. My Bio teacher, Mr. Krieger, is one of the best I've ever had. He is a funny looking bald man with little ears that stick out, but he is so sweet. He likes my questions. I hang around the lab a lot after class. I'm waiting for his lab assistant to quit so that I can take his place. Igor is a brooding giant that hulks around the lab. I think he is jealous of the time I spend with Mr. Krieger.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to see that you've made another friendship."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry, Doc, I'm not going to get involved with this one!", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, I've been hesitant to mention Carla, but I do want to know what your thoughts are. You were having trouble for awhile..."}, {"instruction": "The campus is so big that I haven't run into her so far, thank God. I don't think about her much, except in the shower. I need a new fantasy.", "input": "", "output": "How do you think you would react if you did see her?"}, {"instruction": "It would depend on her reaction. I wouldn't go out of my way to flag her down, but I'd say hi if she did. It's over.", "input": "", "output": "Rachel, do you have any friends other than teachers?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I see Mattie in the hall after my poetry class, and she asks if I'm still writing and if I've joined a group. There are no writing groups that I know of. Besides, I haven't been writing. I haven't even been swimming in three weeks. And it's hard to do downward dog when your nose is running.", "input": "", "output": "Downward dog?"}, {"instruction": "In Sanskrit, it's \"Adho Mukha Svanasana\"--yoga. I'll show you. In fact, why don't you try it? Get on your hands and knees, hands shoulder width apart. Now, keeping your knees slightly bent, raise your hips until your body makes an upside down V. Doctor Balis? Just watch me do it, then.", "input": "", "output": "I'm certain you're not supposed to drink coffee immediately prior to inverting yourself."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I should have mentioned that. Anyway, the idea is to take the arch out of your back and fold at the hip crease. Lengthen your spine as you bring your heels to the floor. Relax your head so that it stays in line with your spine. And breathe.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I don't think I could have done all that well..."}, {"instruction": "My workshop leader says, \"The difference between your pose and mine is that I've done it ten thousand more times than you.\" I couldn't do this at first, either. Whew! Love it! Anyway, I was looking at the Sausalito Parks and Rec guide, and they have tons of yoga classes.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. I see this move as having many possibilities for building new friendships and experiences for you, Rachel. However, you won't have your grandmother to transport you around. Is that going to be a problem?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I'll just have to ride a bus across the bridge to City College. It will take up more of my time, but I have too much time on my hands anyway. I'll just be one more weirdo riding the bus.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you think you'll have any contamination issues in riding public transit?"}, {"instruction": "I'm pretty good at keeping my hands to myself and washing. It's funny how I used to be more of a washer, taking it to extremes. It seems like picking at my hair and nails replaced the washing urges. And I think the medication is helping reduce the urge to pick.", "input": "", "output": "How many pull free days is it now?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't been pulling at all. Want to see?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, if you want to show me."}, {"instruction": "Sure. I like showing off. It's still just a stubble, but my hair has always grown fast. Check it out.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it's barely noticeable."}, {"instruction": "Well, at least it's not a bald patch now.", "input": "", "output": "It looks good. I'm proud of you, Rachel."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. The school has tele-courses, too. You can take classes from your living room, or laundry room.", "input": "", "output": "Good. When is your grandmother leaving for Germany?"}, {"instruction": "December. In fact, she's probably getting antsy waiting for me today. Do you mind if this session is a little short? I should really get back to helping her pack. I'll move in December, too, I guess. I can hardly wait. I can take a break from school and get adjusted, I hope.", "input": "", "output": "It will be easier now that you are feeling better. Oh, by the way, I did communicate with your physician, Doctor Malcolm. We concurred that the increase of fluoxetine to 40 milligrams was appropriate. Are you continuing topical therapy for the psoriasis?"}, {"instruction": "If you mean putting white stuff on my hands, yes.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "You seem to be really uptight, Doctor. You should try to loosen up a bit, do yoga, tease your patients a bit. Then I'll know my therapy is working with you.", "input": "", "output": "Good advice. Well, we'll talk in two weeks?"}, {"instruction": "I'll have a lot to share. Thanks, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Have a good Thanksgiving, Rachel."}]
