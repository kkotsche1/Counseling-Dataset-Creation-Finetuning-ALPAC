[{"instruction": "Hi, do I have the right office? I'm looking for a therapist named Dr. Balis, and I got so hopelessly lost...", "input": "", "output": "I'm Dr. Balis. How can I help you?"}, {"instruction": "Oh good, I found it! I'm Christina Herald and I have an appointment with you today. Right now, by the looks of things.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I see. It's nice to meet you Ms. Herald."}, {"instruction": "Oh, call me Chris please. Whenever I hear Ms. Herald I keep expecting to see my mother.", "input": "", "output": "All right then--Chris. Please have a seat."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I'm sorry for jumping down your throat with the name thing. I'm just not one for standing on antiquated formality. I didn't make you uncomfortable, did I? I don't want to get off to a bad start.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't make me uncomfortable."}, {"instruction": "Oh good. Because a lot of the time I wind up making people uncomfortable without meaning to. I can be very direct to the point of having no tact whatsoever and I don't even stop to think about anyone else. My father says that I'm a very assertive person. My mother just says I'm bossy. I think they're probably both right to some extent. I just worry about hurting people's feelings, because I did it to my ex-boyfriend all the time without meaning to. I didn't come here today to talk about all this and I'm rambling. You'll hear all about my family, my ex, and my big mouth soon enough, I'm sure. So maybe I'd better tell you why I actually came here today, right?", "input": "", "output": "All right. Why are you here Chris?"}, {"instruction": "Ah, the real reason that I'm in here for therapy. Okay. Well, since I was about fifteen years old, I've been having panic attacks. It's kind of a hereditary thing, I guess, because my mom, her sisters, and my grandmother all have them. They started when I was still in high school. The first time I ever had one, I thought I was having a coronary or something. I literally thought my heart would burst, it was pounding so hard.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And you've been having them regularly ever since?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, for about eight years now. Oh, it really wasn't a regular thing, at least not at first. Just every once in awhile. Until my first year of college that is. I had decided to go to school up in Washington state, so I moved up there, thinking it would do me good to get away from my parents for awhile. But the panic attacks got a lot more frequent after I moved. I missed classes and spent a lot of time asleep, because I'd feel so drained after an episode that all I'd want to do is go to bed. I managed to keep my grades high enough to transfer to Berkeley, and I left Washington after my freshman year.", "input": "", "output": "And this is the first time in eight years you've ever sought help?"}, {"instruction": "Well no. Not exactly. The first time was about four years ago when I was still up in Washington. I went to the Health Center and they had one of their staff psychologists talk to me. The guy was a total ass. He basically asked me if I was pregnant or if I was taking any drugs, then grilled me about how I was doing in school and whether or not I cared about my grades. I never went back after the one meeting. Not care about my grades? That was the whole bloody reason I went there, for god's sake.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What happened after you transferred back to Berkeley?"}, {"instruction": "Things got better for awhile. I liked the school a lot more and my friend Janey and I moved into our own apartment. I got a part time job at the cutest little old bookstore near campus--Shakespeare Books, do you know it? I was fairly happy, and the panic attacks were only happening once in a great while. But about six months ago, they started getting worse again. I have my own studio apartment now, because Janey left to go to grad school in New York. I'm going to graduate at the end of this semester, and I already have a job lined up at a high school not too far from here. I don't know why these damned things have been so bad lately, but my schoolwork and personal life are both starting to suffer.", "input": "", "output": "How are the attacks affecting your school and personal life?"}, {"instruction": "I'm just starting to get behind on my assignments. I'm so tired all the time and I have a hard time caring about anything. My father calls it senioritis and makes jokes, but then threatens me with all sorts of dire consequences if I fail out. Like I could flunk now if I tried. But if things keep going well, I could graduate cum laude, and that would be really nice.", "input": "", "output": "And your personal life?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, that was a two part question wasn't it? I'm just starting to snap at people and take out my irritation on my friends when they're not at fault. I rather unceremoniously dumped the guy I've been seeing last weekend after blowing things way out of proportion in an argument we were having. I knew the relationship was over anyway, but had I been myself I might have been a little kinder about it all. Oh well, it's too late to take it all back now.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And could you tell me what happens during one of these panic attacks?"}, {"instruction": "Ugh. My heart starts pounding--not really faster but harder and somehow louder. I can almost hear it. I start having trouble breathing, my hands get sweaty and shaky, and I start to feel claustrophobic. Sometimes I just want to curl up in a corner with all the lights out and hide. And then sometimes I absolutely can't stand to be inside because I feel like I'm choking. I spent something like four hours one day last week on my little patio, chain-smoking and trying to force my heart to slow down. Another thing is that I get this really strange, sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, like I'm standing on the edge of a high cliff. That's the worst part.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. Are there any particular triggers that you've noticed, something that brings on the attacks?"}, {"instruction": "Yes and no. Sometimes if I have a lot of caffeine, I'll have a really bad panic attack. One of the worst ones I've ever had was when I was a freshman in college, and I washed down four Vivarin with a raspberry mocha. Stupid huh? Other times I'll just be sitting at home, reading or watching TV--not doing anything in particular--and kerboom! One big whopping panic attack coming right up. So I'll have to get out for awhile. I'll sit on the patio or go for a walk until I calm down. It can take most of the night for that to happen though, which is why I'm not getting any sleep lately. Stress can bring it on too. Finals, work, fights with the family or whoever the man is this month. I can take so much and then it's just like the roof blows off, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I think I do. Have you tried any sort of relaxation techniques or meditation to try to calm yourself down?"}, {"instruction": "What, you mean like envisioning white light or whatever that was? Yeah, I tried it. It never really helped though. And how do you explain to the professor standing over you that you were ignoring his lecture because you were envisioning your mind filled with white light? We're talking instant F here.", "input": "", "output": "All the same, I think it would be beneficial if we started you on a program involving some relaxing techniques. They can be as simple as putting on some relaxing music. Also, you might want to try cutting back on the caffeine."}, {"instruction": "But caffeine is a necessary nutrient for survival. It makes the world go around, or at least a student's world.", "input": "", "output": "I remember. We used to say it was one of the four basic food groups when I was at college.  I didn't say you had to cut it out, just cut it back. I'd like to try some relaxation training with you.  I have a sheet here which describes the technique.  Basically, I want you to lower the lights and either sit in a comfortable chair or lie down in bed.  And start at your toes, start to tense the muscles and then completely relax them.  Do that twice and then move up your body, tensing and relaxing each of your muscle groups.  I've found this technique effective in helping patients with sleeping difficulties.  It seems to help discharge energy and tension."}, {"instruction": "Discharge energy? What do you mean by that?", "input": "", "output": "Just think of it as a way to abandon the cares of the day and to gain some voluntary control over feelings of tension and relaxation.  Just give it a try, if you will, and let me know how it goes in our next session."}, {"instruction": "Oh, so you're kicking me out now?", "input": "", "output": "Um, I..."}, {"instruction": "I'm just kidding, Doctor. I think I've bent your ear enough for today and I have to be at work in an hour. I'll leave you be now.", "input": "", "output": "Can we schedule next week's appointment?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Next week? Same bat time, same bat channel?", "input": "", "output": "That sounds fine. It was very nice talking to you, Chris. I'll look forward to seeing you next week."}, {"instruction": "Yes, you'll see me. I keep coming back like a fungal infection. So I'm not totally nuts then?", "input": "", "output": "No, I don't think so."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor. Listen, I'm sorry about last week. I'm very embarrassed about the phone call, and the state I was in.", "input": "", "output": "It's all right, Chris. I don't understand why you'd do something like that to yourself. Nice shirt, by the way."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. But I guess I forgot about the midterms, and when I remembered, I got all tense and worried and just generally freaked out. I don't dare slack off in Carmichael's class, because the old goat has had it in for me from the beginning of my college career. He was my Intro to Fiction teacher as well, and decided he didn't like me when I corrected his translation of Shakespearian English. Big mistake there. It was just out of my mouth before I could help it, like so many other things. But as far as the thing with the caffeine, I paid for it. And I might just have learned my lesson.", "input": "", "output": "What happened? Did you have a panic attack?"}, {"instruction": "Um, yeah, you might say that. The funny thing is I was fine, actually coming down a little bit with no ill effects. I was probably going to make it okay. I had a bottle of water by my side like you said and was working that down. Then in walks Kevin.", "input": "", "output": "Kevin?"}, {"instruction": "Remember last time I told you that I dumped the guy I'd been seeing? Kevin's the guy.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I tried to look inconspicuous, but it's hard to do when you're coming down off a pretty optimal rush of caffeine and literature. He spotted me right off and comes trotting over like a puppy. I wish I thought more highly of him, because he's a nice guy. But he just really has no ambition: he's majoring in something different every week. He's gorgeous--all tall and blond and well-cut muscles, and he's good in bed--but there's just no intellectual challenge. It's like trying to have a discussion with a side of beef. But he came over, \"Just to say hi,\" he says, but eventually he starts asking me why I dumped him and backing me into a corner both emotionally and physically, and I freaked. I was ready to say anything to get out of there, even that I'd call him and we'd talk later. I could hardly breathe, he was right there with his hands on either side of me, close to tears and .... ugh. I feel so awful about the whole thing now, but there was really nothing I could do. It would never have worked.", "input": "", "output": "Did you feel physically threatened? Could that have been what set you off?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think I'd call it feeling threatened. I know Kevin would never hurt me. But...crowded.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And you had a panic attack."}, {"instruction": "A six-foot three emotionally distraught ex and a small lake of lukewarm espresso in my belly are not exactly circumstances leading to emotional ease, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "True. What happened next?"}, {"instruction": "I went and sat in my car until I felt capable of driving, then I went home. Sat with my cat for awhile, that took the edge off a little bit. That's about the whole story as far as that episode is concerned.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. How was the rest of the week as far as the panic attacks were concerned?"}, {"instruction": "You'd be proud of me. I wrote all of the days and times and possible triggers down in my notebook. Being a good patient because I was a really bad patient last week when I called. Impressed yet?", "input": "", "output": "Very."}, {"instruction": "Good, because this bespeaks a level of organization that I normally just don't have. Okay. Monday March Third. Happy Birthday to Me. Ten-fifty-five p.m. After a rather strained evening out with my family I arrive back at my apartment to find that Kevin has left a rather odd present before my front door. To be more specific, a kitten. This is, incidentally, the cat I mentioned earlier, Doctor. Well, I couldn't very well let the little thing freeze, so I brought him in and named him Lancelot, in honor of an old friend who I nicknamed Lancelot a long time ago. This isn't the point . The point is I had a panic attack earlier in the evening while having an argument through gritted teeth with my father over whether or not my kid brother should be allowed to do what the hell he wants with his life regardless of whether or not Dad is paying for his college.", "input": "", "output": "Your father doesn't think so?"}, {"instruction": "What, Frank Herald give up control of any particular thing he feels his time or money has a stake in? Not in a million, baby. He's the original control freak. He wants Jonny, my brother, to go into business or law or something where he can be some sort of a big wheel in the whatever. I don't know. It's a businessman thing I guess. But Jonny wants to be a veterinarian and just live up in Oregon tending cows and horses and generally being happily useless to the corporate world at large. So Dad starts lecturing him on this and that and all those stupid business proverbs, \"If you're not the lead dog the view never changes,\" and all that shit. And for the first time in recorded history, Jonny stood up for himself. Right there in Fillio's in front of the snooty waiters with their little mustaches and phony Italian accents. So I backed him up, and Dad gave me his patented \"Herald the Horrible\" look--his nickname around the office when he's not there, you might have overheard it or not, I don't know. Then he started in on me. And my stepmother is giving me this really disgusted look, and her daughter is just sitting there batting her eyes at the stud puppy in tight black slacks who's bussing the next table. My family has the total yours, mine, and ours thing going on. I'm Dad's from his first marriage to my mother, my stepsister Monica is Joanne's daughter from her first marriage, and Jonathan is Joanne and Dad's kid together. Neither Joanne nor Monica have brains beneath their perfect blond chignons, either. So we got into it, finally ending with Dad calling me an ungrateful little brat and me countering with the witty observation that he may have money and position but he has about as much soul as a rock. So the evening ended on a bad note. I got home and fell apart. But Lancelot actually kind of helped. It's nice to have another living thing in the apartment besides the plants. Anyway, I was just so upset I called Mommy in London, where she's working right now, and she made me feel a little bit better. She said that the panic attacks get milder as she gets older. Do you think that's true?", "input": "", "output": "It might be. Your family life sounds pretty stressful."}, {"instruction": "That's why I avoid it whenever possible, at least Dad and Joanne's unholy alliance. Mom is okay when she's in town. But Aunt Sara's the best. She lives down in San Diego, and I go see her on weekends sometimes. She's Mom's sister, and is probably more like me than anyone else in the family. But I digress. We're talking about panic attacks here.", "input": "", "output": "Chris, you don't have to worry about it. You can talk about other things besides your panic attacks. It actually helps when you do, because it gives me some insight into your circumstances and personality. So just go ahead."}, {"instruction": "Oh. Okay, cool.", "input": "", "output": "But while we're at a lull in the conversation there are a few things I'd like to mention to you."}, {"instruction": "Okay, shoot.", "input": "", "output": "First of all, I did a little research on the link between panic attacks and family members. It does have a higher rate of occurrence between monozygotic twins--"}, {"instruction": "Monowhatsits?", "input": "", "output": "Doctor-speak for identical."}, {"instruction": "Okay, freshman year, Principles of Biology 101. I remember now. Go ahead.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, the rate for both identical twins getting panic attacks is something like a 45% rate. It's 15% for fraternal twins."}, {"instruction": "Hold on. Since fraternal twins are basically just brothers or sisters or brothers and sisters who happen to be in the uterus at the same time rather than naturally-occurring clones, wouldn't the 15% rate be the same for regular siblings?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but what I'm getting at is that there is scientific basis to think that this could be a hereditary condition."}, {"instruction": "Oh, okay. Sorry.", "input": "", "output": "It's a good question. Another thing I wanted to discuss with you is seeing another doctor--not a psychiatrist but a good internist--to rule out the possibility of any illness that might mimic the symptoms of panic disorder. Here's the business card of a colleague of mine who's on your father's health insurance. He should be able to help you."}, {"instruction": "Douglas Halsey, M.D. Okay, I'll make an appointment asap.", "input": "", "output": "Good. One more thing I wanted to mention before I let you go for the day is whether you'd consider pharmacological options for treating your condition."}, {"instruction": "Like drugs? Depends. What sort of drugs are we talking about?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I've had good results in the past using anti-depressants to treat panic disorder. But you look doubtful."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I'm not terribly comfortable with the idea of drugs. Between caffeine and nicotine, I usually have enough of them in my system, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Well, these might be a little more useful than those.  But think about it. If you're really uncomfortable with the idea, then we'll work without them. I'm just letting you know it's an option."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'll think about it. It was nice talking to you, Doctor, and once again I'm sorry about last week. Like the tie, by the way.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, well thank you. I got it at the amber exhibit at the California Academy of Sciences.  I was hoping the bugs wouldn't put off my patients. And don't worry about last week. Just try to be a little more careful with the espresso, okay?"}, {"instruction": "I will. Promise. Bye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Christina."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Christina. How have you been?"}, {"instruction": "Nuts. Everything is insane. I suppose I owe you an apology as well as an explanation, eh? Well I apologize, but I think when you hear what happened, you'll understand.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Fucking Kevin is what happened. He's gone all strange on me. Okay. Wednesday, he calls me and asks to borrow my car because his died and he absolutely has to get to this job interview. His whole life and future career depends on this, and since I already pretty much ruined his life by breaking up with him, I can at least help him out with this part. Beautiful guilt trip, huh? As if I don't have enough problems. So I don't have anywhere to be at this particular moment--it's a Wednesday night, I'm not working, nothing is going on in my life except me and Lancelot getting cozy with some--and you will be as impressed as all hell about this one--herbal tea, and the complete works of Shakespeare. Studying without caffeine. Be impressed. Anyways, it gets to be about eleven pm. No Kevin. Later and later. Finally I call Berkeley's Finest at about twelve-thirty. Yeah right, like they're going to do anything about it. He was my boyfriend for six months, I lent him the vehicle willingly. They aren't going to move after ten thirty unless someone has the audacity to rob Dunkin' Donuts. I'm told to call again in the morning if he doesn't turn up. He doesn't. I fall asleep and wake up at six-thirty in the morning when a badge wearing a blue suit decides to bang on my door and inform me that my ex was out drinking and decided to drive my car after having a party with a Coors keg. So where was I? At the police station while they booked Kevin on D.W.I., crying over the wreckage of my poor little Cavalier and dealing with my dear old Dad's lecture on my stupidity. Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of my life. Apology accepted yet?", "input": "", "output": "Uh, yes. Sounds like you had quite a day. I was worried, though. Next time call, all right?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah. Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Now, Dr. Halsey called me and says you're in perfect health.  He couldn't find any physical reasons for your panic disorder."}, {"instruction": "I figured.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's good news.  So what we need to do now is start looking for other causes for your disorder. When we get done talking today, do you have anywhere you need to be for about an hour or so?"}, {"instruction": "No, why?", "input": "", "output": "Because if you don't mind, I have a program on my computer called the California Personality Inventory that may help us quantify at least some of the basic characteristics of your personality. I'd like to have you sit down and complete the test, then we can talk about it next week."}, {"instruction": "What, you mean like type A, type B, and all that stuff? We did that in Psych 101. I had to take a few of those classes, too. They're required for an education degree. I already know the answer. In a lot of things, I'm very much a type A personality. Things have to be done at certain times. I don't like being made late or when circumstances throw me off schedule. Oh, no!", "input": "", "output": "What on earth is that sound?"}, {"instruction": "Um, that's Lancelot, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Oh. Lancelot. I see...he's extremely cute. Rather hard to believe that a noise that loud came out of something that small."}, {"instruction": "I'm very, very sorry about this, Doctor. I had to take him to the vet's for his shots and I didn't have time to take him all the way back home before I had to come here, and I couldn't leave him in the car because it's so warm out.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. I think it's okay for today, so long as he's not in regular attendance. Besides, he's quieted down now. So, anyway, How was the rest of your week. Any panic episodes?"}, {"instruction": "I'm still keeping that notebook, you know. It's a great help. I had only one really noticeable episode this week, as well as a few minor ones.", "input": "", "output": "The notebook is a very good idea, Chris. I'd like to see you keep that up. Now, tell me about what happened."}, {"instruction": "Okay. My brother Jonny came over Friday night. He spends the weekend with me sometimes just to get away from Dad and Joanne. Well, I'm playing doting sister, stuffing him full of my special pesto and angel-hair pasta meal, and he's loving every minute. Then after dinner, he gets all serious. He starts by telling me about how much he appreciates the way I stuck up for him with Dad, and how understanding I am, and how I always looked out for him even when we were very young. Then he says that he needs me now more than ever, as he has recently come to terms with a very big part of his life, and he wanted to tell me first because I am the most supportive person he knows. My brother's gay. Not a big deal in and of itself, but there it is. I asked him who the lucky boy was, and he blushed and everything, we had a good laugh and then spent a pleasant hour discussing various male celebrities' posteriors. Then comes the bombshell. He wants me to break the news to Dad and Joanne, after he leaves for college in the fall. He's got a full scholarship to some school in Minnesota that I guess really wants to teach him how to be a veterinarian. But if Dad disowns him, he says I'll be the only family he has. It just got worse from there, and that's what made me freak out. Not the fact that my baby brother and I have the same taste in men, but the fact that I may well be the one to tell Herald the Horrible that his son is a homosexual.", "input": "", "output": "That's a bit unfair of him, to make that request of you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, I know why he asked me. Jonny and I both know that Dad would eat him alive if he tried to tell him by himself. I tried to talk him out of it, even saying that I would be there with him while he spoke with Dad, but his mind is set that this is the only way its going to work. Poor kid's terrified. Although I will say that I'm impressed that he's going to tell Dad at all. Before this, Jonny would have just stayed in the closet all his life and just kept his sex life as far away from Dad as humanly possible. But that night he stuck up for himself at the restaurant, it was like something snapped in Jonny, and he got tired of being put-upon by everyone else. Using me as a shield is only the first step for him. So long as he has someone strong to fall back on, he'll continue to assert himself, and eventually he'll have done it enough to be able to stand on his own.", "input": "", "output": "So what are you going to do?"}, {"instruction": "I'll probably be the one to tell Dad. It seems the only option. Oh, I'll try to talk him out of it before he leaves for school, tell him how good it would be for him to tell Dad himself and all that, but I doubt very seriously that it will work. But I can't let him suffer.", "input": "", "output": "That's very noble of you, Chris. You must love your brother a lot."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, the kid is all right. But it is yet another issue to add to my pile of issues. It was just the major one this week.", "input": "", "output": "What else happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I wrote my midterm essay for Carmichael and handed it in. Work of art. Sheer fucking genius. The old bastard gave me a grudging A minus because he said my interpretation of the piece was only a little better than superficial. Superficial my pretty ass. I had it out with the gargoyle, right there in the classroom. Still wouldn't up my grade, but I know he knows I was right because his neck turned bright red, like a steamed lobster. That only happens when he's really angry, and nothing makes him angrier than being wrong. As far as work is concerned, my boss is going on maternity leave in about two weeks, and she's putting me in command of the starship for the next two months or so until she's back in the saddle. Ordering, inventory, the whole big hairy, I have to do it. My pay goes up, which is one good thing, and of course I'm flattered that Lucy thought of me, but it is one more stressful thing to add to the pile. Then there is Kevin, who totaled my car. Given that he is an unemployed college student, it is doubtful that my vehicle will be restored anytime soon. It all depends on what insurance has to say, and I already know that my insurance company is NOT happy with the situation. My premiums are going to skyrocket. Kevin is also still whining about how much he loves me and how I ruined his life. Gods, I hate that sort of weakness. I know it's supposed to be all cool for a guy to be sensitive, but I just can't stand people who do nothing but whine and cry about how horrible their life is and don't do anything about it! They're so...so ineffectual! How do they ever get through life just bemoaning how terrible everything's been?", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you really think?"}, {"instruction": "No, I suppose not. Okay, here's where it all comes out. I guess I'm just tired. Tired of holding everything together for a hundred other people when things are falling apart all around me. It's like plugging ten holes in a dam with all ten fingers, then another hole opens up and water starts pouring through. Where most people would start screaming for help, I grit my teeth and start using my toes to stop up the holes. You follow me?", "input": "", "output": "I think so, Chris. This could be important. You seem to be taking on a lot in your life. Do you ever wonder if it might be too much?"}, {"instruction": "Constantly, Doctor. Constantly. But if I don't do it, it won't get done. And it has to get done. But sometimes I get so frustrated, I feel like screaming. I'm sitting there and I'm thinking, why am I all stressed out because they screwed up? Why can't someone clean up after me for a change? Why can't I get Kevin to give me some advice about how to handle my job, or maybe get Jonny to steer Kevin away from me? I'm everyone else's rock to cling to--when do I get my rock? Of course, that's where you come in, I'm sure. In fact, this is the only relationship that makes sense to me right now. I talk, you listen, I pay, you give advice, I leave. Simple, cut and dried. Both parties know exactly what's expected of them and perform reasonably well. I wish my relationship with Kevin could have made that much sense. To be perfectly honest, Doctor, I really didn't want to give him up. He was...well, he may not have been the ideal, but he was as close as I had ever come before. And he's not as stupid as I make him sound, either. I was just feeling claustrophobic. I knew The Big Question wasn't far around the corner, and as much as I liked the guy, I was afraid. Maybe its childish to dump a good man who respects and loves you for a silly fantasy, but I have this paranoid fear that if I tie myself down then something or someone that would make me incredibly, perfectly happy would come into my life, and because I was bound, I would be unable to accept it. And then it would be gone. I think I'm running past time here. I'll stuff the fur ball back into his box, and take my leave of you, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Chris. I think we might have made some progress here. We'll talk more about it next week, okay? In the meantime, keep on with the journal. And try not to take so much on. Set some priorities for yourself, look at your goals, and try not to take on things that don't lead to your goals.  And make sure that you have some time to relax scheduled in there, or you'll wind up with an ulcer before you're thirty."}, {"instruction": "Actually, Doctor, I had one of those when I was fourteen. Have a good afternoon.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Goodbye, Christina."}, {"instruction": "I gave him a time out. He was being a bad kitty. How are you, Doctor? Feeling better?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, thank you. It wasn't a fun week though."}, {"instruction": "I can well imagine. Hey, do you want to hear something weird?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's about Professor Carmichael.", "input": "", "output": "Ah, yes. The gargoyle."}, {"instruction": "Yup. Apparently the old goat had a heart attack while ripping one of his freshman comp. students to pieces over a grammatical error.", "input": "", "output": "Oh my. Did he pull through?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he's too stubborn to die. But here's the screwy part: I got a call later that day when I was at home from his son, who said he'd been asking to see me. So I go over to the hospital, albeit rather reluctantly, and go up to see the prof. He's sitting there in this bed looking all gray and nasty, but he starts arguing with me immediately. He starts bitching me out over some minor point of reference that I failed to pick up on when I had him for Shakespeare One. I'm trying to stay calm. I mean the old guy just had a whopper of a cardiac, and is lucky to be here. He shouldn't get excited. But before long, I'm so pissed that I start yelling back at him and we're going at it for the better part of an hour. The nurses are terrified. Then, all of a sudden, he just laughs and pats my hand like I'm his favorite grandniece or something. Then he hands me a stack of folders and papers with a lesson plan on top, and says, if I want the job, that he's just hired himself a teacher's assistant, and that I should go to the Human Resources office the next day to fill out the paperwork. Then he tells me to get the hell out of there, he has to get some sleep. And that was it.", "input": "", "output": "I see. This was unexpected, then?"}, {"instruction": "Unexpected? It was ridiculous! I never heard anything so silly in all my life, and I told him so.", "input": "", "output": "Then you went over to Human Resources."}, {"instruction": "First thing this morning.", "input": "", "output": "Christina, you do know that this means you are taking on another job, don't you?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I know what you're going to say...", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but are you going to listen this time?"}, {"instruction": "Listen, Doc. That professor that everyone calls a gargoyle is just a sick old man with a passion for literature. He's a good guy and I realize just how much I learned from him, and how good his constant challenge has been for me academically. I owe him, and I just now realized that. If he wants me to teach his class for him while he is laid up in the hospital, then I will.", "input": "", "output": "Chris, you take too much on yourself. Something's got to give sooner or later, and if you keep adding to the load then that something will be you."}, {"instruction": "So what do I do? Let everything go to hell, just ignore it? All my life I've been told what a selfish person I was. I have ambitions that nothing is going to get in the way of. I'm blunt, sarcastic, loud, messy, selfish, self-centered, vain, smug, superior. But who cares as long as I get the job done, right? I am all of those things and more. But, on top of everything else, I'm stubborn. And I'm too stubborn to give anything up. Without someone holding the reins, things tend to run wild.", "input": "", "output": "Calm down, there's no need to yell. I'd be the last person to call you selfish, Chris. But your altruism is going to get you into trouble."}, {"instruction": "I wouldn't call it altruism. I'd call it being far too controlling. I'd call it turning into my father.", "input": "", "output": "You think you're turning into your father?"}, {"instruction": "Yes...I just realized it this moment. I'm turning into my father. Acting exactly like him. Holy shit, this is terrifying.", "input": "", "output": "it's okay, really. You're not Herald the Horrible yet. What we need to do is teach you to relax. You don't have to control everyone around you, all the time."}, {"instruction": "I just hate the feeling of being powerless. I don't like to think of another person being able to tell me what to do and how to do it, how to get to where I'm going and how to dress when I get there. It makes me feel like I'm drowning, you know? Hell, maybe that's why I have those damned panic attacks. I get something thrown at me that I don't have control of, and until I master it, I freak out. It makes a lot of sense, come to think of it. Do you think I'm obsessive-compulsive?", "input": "", "output": "Do you wash your hands a hundred times in a row?"}, {"instruction": "Noooo....", "input": "", "output": "Christina, I don't think you're obsessive-compulsive. I do, however, think you worry too much about things you can't control, and are too fixated with being on top of everything. Any normal person would have collapsed by now under the strain of everything you do. You're taking a full class schedule, I assume?"}, {"instruction": "Yup. Teaching classes and English classes. They've been my life for the past two years or so.", "input": "", "output": "And you work at the bookstore."}, {"instruction": "Acting manager.", "input": "", "output": "Now you're a teaching assistant at Berkeley..."}, {"instruction": "Just until Carmichael gets better!", "input": "", "output": "Your ex-boyfriend wrecked your car and is in jail at the moment..."}, {"instruction": "Not my problem anymore.

You have got to prioritize your life."}, {"instruction": "What I need is a couple extra hours in every day...don't look at me that way, Doctor. Please. I know you're right, it's just easier said than done. I have to go to school. I have to help my brother. I have to have a job. I want to help Carmichael. I feel like I owe the old goat.", "input": "", "output": "There is no reason you can't help your teacher if you feel that strongly about it. But you will have to give less attention to something else."}, {"instruction": "Oh boy. That is going to be a problem.", "input": "", "output": "Nevertheless, it has to be done or you're going to break down like an old car."}, {"instruction": "Oh colorful metaphor, Doctor. Maybe you missed your calling.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, well, as I was saying..."}, {"instruction": "Do you have a girlfriend, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Chris..."}, {"instruction": "Because you remind me of my professor for Victorian Literature, Dr. Graham. She's single, and she's cute.", "input": "", "output": "Chris!"}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, Doctor. I just get impish sometimes, and you just happened to be here. I know this is supposed to be a serious psychological thing that I'm doing here, but I just had to lighten the mood some. I can't take things being too serious for too long. I think I'm getting back to my old self again; I've actually been sleeping and eating at regular intervals. Healthy food too, no more late night dates with the Doritos bag. That's mostly Malcolm's doing, though.", "input": "", "output": "Malcolm?"}, {"instruction": "Remember the guy who works at Roma's I was telling you about? Well, he moved into the apartment below mine, and we've started eating together. He's into a lot of Asian foods--Japanese and Thai and stuff like that. It's a lot healthier, and actually still tastes good. He does martial arts and things, too. It's not a dating thing yet, but we are hanging out. He's actually playing chauffeur for me until I get the Starship Cavalier out of the mechanic's grubby little paws.", "input": "", "output": "I see. A proper diet can be a good step towards getting yourself regulated. We haven't really discussed your panic disorder yet this week. Any problems?"}, {"instruction": "Ta dah! The all-knowing notebook. Okay, here we go. April the Oneth, Nineteen ninety seven. Jonny called. He and his boyfriend broke up and his boyfriend is threatening to call Dadums and let him in on his only son's--ahem--preference for snails.", "input": "", "output": "Huh?"}, {"instruction": "Did you ever see Spartacus?  Skip it.  Anyway, Jonny called me in tears, wigging out. I thought the poor kid was having a panic attack of his own. This wasn't what set me off. What set me off was the fact that Jonny wanted to leave the house that night and come hide at my place. Jonny doesn't have a car and he sure as hell doesn't have money for a taxi to Berkeley. He said he'd hitchhike. That's what set me off--the image of my baby brother walking down the road and getting hit by a drunk driver, mugged, or worse. I made him promise he wouldn't do anything so terribly stupid and he just kept sobbing, saying he couldn't stand it anymore. I should have gotten tough and told him to quit being a drama queen, but I didn't. I told him to stick it out for a few more days until I got my car fixed then he could spend another weekend with me if he wanted to.", "input": "", "output": "This is what you wrote down on the first?"}, {"instruction": "Yeppers.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think now?"}, {"instruction": "To be quite honest, I think Jonny should just tell Dad and Joanne and be done with it. If Dad does throw him out, he can stay at my place or aunt Sarah's; he'll still have his full scholarship to his school. But I don't think Dad will. He may be a totally conservative old bastard, but no one ever said that Dad did not, in his own taciturn way, love his children. Sometimes I wish Jonny and I had the same mother. Mom's flighty and more irresponsible than she should be at her age, but she's a good listener and very liberal and forgiving.", "input": "", "output": "Then maybe you should have a talk with your brother this weekend and tell him that."}, {"instruction": "Maybe I will. I'm also wondering if I shouldn't quit the bookstore and try to get in more hours as a teaching assistant. It'll actually help me a lot in my chosen field--more than the bookstore will, as much as I love it. But I like being in front of a classroom too much, and the gods know that I don't want to work retail all my life!", "input": "", "output": "This is a good idea..."}, {"instruction": "Besides, that's more time on campus. My grades need to come back up a bit; right now school is the most important thing in my life. It has to be. it's almost over. I had a lot of fun while I was in school--I'm not a total workhorse--but it's time for it to be over.", "input": "", "output": "You know, you're starting to sound a bit more rational about your commitments. I think there is definitely potential here for things to improve."}, {"instruction": "So I'm not a totally hopeless case?", "input": "", "output": "Far from it, Chris. We're almost out of time. You keep on with your notebook--I meant to ask if I could take a look at it from time to time?"}, {"instruction": "But Doctor, that's where I keep my secrets. It's my diary. Nah, I don't care. You can look at it if you like.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. How's the kitten?"}, {"instruction": "The little shit ate my herb garden.", "input": "", "output": "He did?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I have one of those little window box gardens, for fresh herbs. Mostly basil and rosemary, with some lemongrass thrown in. Lancelot ate a bunch of the new leaves. He must have thought it was catnip or something. Anyways, I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Chris. I'll look forward to it."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Hey, do you have a cat, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "No.  No cat."}, {"instruction": "Did you ever wonder why a cat doesn't come when you call? Because the snooty little brats know they're descended from royalty. Cats were kings and queens in Egypt, and they still get treated that way by anyone who owns one. Why should they do anything when it's not convenient to them? That's the thought for the day. Have a good afternoon, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Bye bye, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Good afternoon, Doctor B. How goes?", "input": "", "output": "Not too bad, thanks. You're looking chipper today."}, {"instruction": "It's been an incredibly good week.", "input": "", "output": "Really? That's good. How do you like being a T.A.?"}, {"instruction": "That's part of what made it so great. I am loving this new job. By the way, I put in my notice at Shakespeare Books. Lucy wasn't happy at first, but she understood when I explained it to her, and I helped her pick someone else to play manager while she's out with Baby.", "input": "", "output": "I hope it's not that odd androgynous creature with the septum piercing. She was quite rude when I was in there last."}, {"instruction": "I didn't know you'd been in the shop. And no, Jody will not be playing manager. Gabriel got the part. The tall sad-looking guy with the black hair, looks like your typical \"alterna-teen.\"", "input": "", "output": "Oh, all right. I'm not too sure who you're talking about, but that's okay. How's the panic disorder doing?"}, {"instruction": "Surprisingly mild lately. I can't help but wonder, though, if this is just the calm before the storm. Maybe I'm being paranoid. But I'll probably flip out around finals. This time next month I will officially be a basket case. Maybe you should go ahead and measure me for a happy huggy coat now, save time later.", "input": "", "output": "That's a novel way of referring to a straitjacket."}, {"instruction": "Well, I thought it was funny. Want to hear the latest on the Kevin situation?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, now this should prove interesting..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. Big-time. Well, somehow he raised bail money, and he's taken to hanging around campus, or my apartment building, calling and hanging up. If he's trying to stalk me, he's got to be the most inept stalker in the world. He did call to ask how the kitten and I were getting along. I told him that Little Lance was fine but my ferns would never be the same. He apologized for wrecking my car. I told him that I would probably think it was funny in twenty years but I wasn't going to forgive him right now. He asked if he could stop by, and I said no. Then he said would I at least come out and talk to him because he was at the pay-phone outside. Malcolm happened to be in my apartment cooking dinner and marched downstairs and warned him to stay away from me. To the tune of a mild concussion. Kevin's just not having any luck, is he?", "input": "", "output": "So your new boyfriend assaulted your old one?"}, {"instruction": "I guess you could say that, yeah. Malcolm doesn't often come out of the basement, but when he does he tends to assert himself quite well.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me a bit about Malcolm. He seemed kind of...well, forbidding. Not really the type of man one would expect you to be attracted to."}, {"instruction": "He's a hard one to figure. And as far as what I'm attracted to, the usual qualification is that he's male. But Malcolm is intriguing, simply because he's so forbidding. It's weird, actually. There's a very sensual quality to someone being that dark, both in appearance and manner. I think I read one too many vampire stories when I was a kid.", "input": "", "output": "The Gothic look. I know what you're referring to. You find that attractive?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. Look, Doc, how did we get onto the subject of my sex-life, anyways? Malcolm's not a psychotic. I know he looks it, but he's not. Okay?", "input": "", "output": "You don't have to get defensive, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Sorry. I just don't feel like discussing my sex-life in therapy. It's one of the few parts of my life that still sometimes makes sense, so I would kind of like to keep it that way. Afraid to jinx it, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine. We can talk about whatever you like."}, {"instruction": "Maybe I should tell you a bit more about my family. You did say that this panic thingy was probably hereditary, right?", "input": "", "output": "Yes it is.  Talking about your family might be helpful."}, {"instruction": "Okay. What about my family...yeah. Right. Really nothing I haven't already said. I just don't really know what to talk about today. I think this cold snap has me depressed.", "input": "", "output": "You're feeling depressed?"}, {"instruction": "Will you stop that? That is so irritating when you just parrot back at me what I've already said. Can't we just talk like normal people, more or less? That is usually one of the better things about you. You have more imagination than the average shrink.", "input": "", "output": "You're really not giving me a whole lot to work with today, Christina. I'm quite frankly trying to delve beneath the conventional bland front that you're putting on for me today.  It's not like you."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I see. I'm sorry for snapping at you, doctor, but I am just feeling totally sapped right now. Sullen, non-communicative, I just really want to go to sleep. Once the two weeks notice is up at Shakespeare's, then it'll all get easier. But until then, I have too many balls in the air. You were right about that much. I was surviving on adrenaline and caffeine. Once I kicked out the caffeine...all right, cut it back...I didn't have the energy to really throw myself into as much as I used to. So, I have been cutting things back. I cut loose the job at the bookstore, and Kevin. Malcolm is much lower-maintenance than Kevin was anyway. So I traded one job for another, and one man for another. The conflict with Carmichael has resolved itself. Jonny is probably going to be okay--it seems he's easing into the idea of telling Dad and Joanne about his sexual orientation himself. So hopefully that's one block out of the way. Dad seems to be a lot more relaxed lately; I think he's planning early retirement now that he's hit the top of the food chain in his line of work. I guess I'm really worried that things are beginning to go too smoothly, and I keep waiting for the monkey wrench to be thrown into the works.", "input": "", "output": "Like it's too good to last, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, exactly. I'm writing again, though, and that is most definitely a good thing. I don't like myself when I'm not writing, because originally that was the whole point of my being a teacher. Vacations, weekends, and summer to write and live as I choose to. You think I wanted to be a teacher because of some altruistic need to help the youth of America? Hell, no! It was convenient to make money that way while I pursued my true craft. But I got hooked on it. I love the moment when comprehension just lights up someone's face, or seeing someone really enjoy and relate to a classic piece of literature almost two hundred years old, and all because of me! My assistance opening doors for people. It's quite a rush of feeling, and it's hard to explain. But by the same token, I wonder if I'm losing sight of my original dreams, like I'm settling for something more accessible and secure. I would never be happy living from royalty check to royalty check, or submitting articles as a freelance writer to keep food in me and Lancelot until the novel got published. I hate not feeling secure. So I learn a trade where I can at least touch my dreams somehow, and save my truth till summer. I'm a sellout, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Chris, I hardly think you're a sellout. You're simply practical..."}, {"instruction": "But practicality is the antithesis of art! It's like matter and antimatter. If I'm a practical, responsible little schoolteacher, my creativity shrivels and dies. But if I throw myself into my writing and get completely lost in it, where does the money for things like rent and food and kitty litter come from? How do I put gas in my car, keep myself healthy? There's a reason that writers and artists all look so gaunt and haggard, Doctor. It's because they don't eat until the royalty checks come. And they don't come fast enough unless you're Stephen King or John Grisham. I'll tell you what this is: It's my mother and my father jostling for control of my mind. My mother left a marriage and a three year old daughter to travel to New York and work as a theatrical costumer. The clothes spoke to her, as did the smell of dust and sweat and make-up, the frenzied mending of a torn seam in between scenes, the oohs and aahs as an actress steps onto the stage in a stunning gown that she created. It doesn't matter if the money is sporadic, it's the art that's important! But my father is different. He went out and found a stepmother for his three year old daughter because he had to go make money to support her, feed her, put her through school. He wanted to succeed and make money, so he could take care of his family in a better, more privileged manner than the one he had been raised in. He worked his ass off to do it, too. Now he's fifty-five years old and planning to retire early to enjoy the rest of his life. So there is the side of practicality. But it has its price. The more conservatively you act, eventually your mind will narrow until you can't act any other way. You act small, you live small, sooner or later you think small. And for me, that is death.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So I have to find some sort of balance. And I haven't been able to, not yet. Did you know that I actually had to force myself to start writing again? And I was annoyed at first because it was taking time away from my studies, time that I could have been in class watching how teachers work. Dr.Graham gave me an open invitation to sit in on any of her classes, anytime. And I have--quite a bit in fact. Maybe that's another part of my problem.", "input": "", "output": "Visiting Dr. Graham's class?"}, {"instruction": "No, looking for things that aren't there. My perfect ideal man, the balance between creativity and practicality. Maybe they don't exist.", "input": "", "output": "I think that with a little effort, maybe some time management..."}, {"instruction": "No, Doctor. I don't think time management will help. This is an emotional crisis, maybe even a spiritual one. Not a physical or scheduling problem. I'm not going to go New Age and start swinging crystals around and mumbling about chakras, but I do need to make a decision about what's important to me. But my hour's almost up so I'm going to go ahead and leave. I have a lot to think about. If you don't mind that I cut out a bit early...", "input": "", "output": "I understand, Chris. Let me know if there's anything I can do. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Lie down on the couch and tell me about your mother.  How are you today, Herr Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I'm all right. But your Viennese accent needs some work.  Where did you find that contraption?"}, {"instruction": "Isn't it cute? It's a bubble pipe. The silliest thing about it is that it seems to occasionally try to force feed me bubble soap. Bleech, the stuff tastes nasty. I apologize if I've gotten bubbles all over your desk, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure it will survive. How have you been, Chris?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, okay. Went to lunch with Dad today, which was, as always, a thrill and a half. He takes me out to lunch about once a month, to ask me how school's going and if I need any money and why the hell I felt the need to move out anyway when it was perfectly feasible for me to live at home while attending Berkeley. I told him that school was great, I didn't need any money, and that unless he wanted me to eventually poison his wife's peas he'd better be glad I moved out. He just gave me that fatherly chuckle that annoys the shit out of me and waves the waiter over for the check. Huh. I almost thought for a moment that he wouldn't be too disappointed if I did poison Joanne's peas.", "input": "", "output": "I take it that you and your stepmother don't get along."}, {"instruction": "We have a personality conflict. I have a personality, she has a conflict.", "input": "", "output": "Ah, I see."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, I went and visited Aunt Sarah this past weekend.", "input": "", "output": "How did that go?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, great.

You'd hardly believe we were related.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me a bit more about your aunt. You seem very close to her."}, {"instruction": "Well, she was more my mother than my Mom was, that's for sure. After Mom left, Sarah moved in with Dad and me for about a year, until Dad started seeing Joanne. She took care of me and stuff, doing all the normal mommy things that her sister couldn't quite lower herself to perform. She lives alone down in San Diego, where she moved about four years ago. She's a total computer nut. She loves the damned things! She never sells the outdated ones; she keeps them up on tables in Gavin's room, and they all still work. She even has a working Commodore 64.

How is school going?"}, {"instruction": "Well, assembling my family for graduation is turning into a logistical nightmare. Within a week of my graduation, Jonny graduates from high school, so everyone's going to be hanging around. Well, most everyone. Mom and her fianc\u00e9 are flying back to London the day after my graduation, and obviously Grandma Strauss won't be hanging around for Jonny's.  She's never quite stopped blaming my father for the whole divorce and stuff, never mind the fact that Mom left Dad. I think Aunt Sarah's whisking Grandma away to San Diego with her, quickly and quietly. Aunt Sarah can always be depended upon for the tactful withdrawal of the loud grandmother who screams at everyone in German when she gets angry. But if Grandma tries to force-feed me that liver dumpling soup again this time, I will definitely run and hide until she leaves.", "input": "", "output": "Your grandmother sounds like quite a character."}, {"instruction": "Oh that's nothing compared to Dad's side of the family. Mom's side is pretty small: just Mom, Sarah, Gavin, and Grandma. Dad has this huge teeming family of loudmouthed Canadians. Grandma and Grandpa Herald are sweet people, but the rest of the family I can do well without. My uncles are assholes, my cousins make Bob and Doug MacKenzie look intelligent, and my aunt is in some weird sort of coven, I think. They go running about in the Canadian wilderness doing god-knows-what and scaring the hell out of the bears in the process, I'm sure. Great-Grandpa Maguire is cool though. He's Dad's mother's father, and he's originally from County Meath in Ireland. He taught me a bit of Gaelic when I was really young, and he sits and delivers an absolute diatribe on his son-in-law for hours with me being the only one that understands what he's saying.

I was just having a bad day.", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be having a considerably better one now."}, {"instruction": "Yup, and I am feeling very, very relaxed. I had a glass of wine at lunch, too, so that's probably why I'm so chatty today. Oh, please, don't look at me like that.

He practices martial arts; I remember you saying that now."}, {"instruction": "Yes, he actually teaches at the dojo a couple of blocks from the Cafe Roma. I went and watched one night. It's pretty amazing. I thought about joining a class for about five seconds, then I realized that they require a lot more self-discipline than I think I have. Still, it's an interesting thought. But he does have a tendency to brood, I will say that. And he's extremely protective. That night he went after Kevin kind of proved that. Anything important to me, he looks out for. Lancelot doesn't seem to appreciate him much, though. He always hisses at him, then takes off under the futon with his tail all puffed out.

Kevin was lurking around and that didn't make me terribly happy, but Malcolm taking off after him like some sort of beat-em-up-Bruce-Lee-was-a-patsy demon from hell wasn't exactly pleasing either. I flipped out, seriously. There's a new contender for the worst panic attack of my life. Malcolm comes back inside, all sweaty, his knuckles split open across his right hand, and he just looks at me. So I start yelling, telling him that it was uncalled-for, all that sort of thing. I tell him to get out, and he still just stands there. The next thing I know, well...things happened.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I'm sure you are probably questioning my judgment now...", "input": "", "output": "Not at all, Chris. You are an adult, and who you choose to be with is entirely up to you. You do know to take precautions, right?"}, {"instruction": "I'm downright paranoid about it, Doctor. Maybe even more than I need to be. And I've drilled that into Jonny's head too, which I think is a good thing.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, very good. I don't think that there is such a thing as being too paranoid right now."}, {"instruction": "True. Especially for Jonny. Although, according to what he's told me, he is...oh how can I put this delicately--screw it. I can't. He prefers to give rather than receive if you get my meaning. And while that may be a little less risky, the risk is still there. So I gave him an hour long lecture, after which he was well and truly as paranoid as I. Am I a great sister, or what?", "input": "", "output": "Absolutely. Has he decided to tell your father yet?"}, {"instruction": "He's going to do it. I have to be there with him, but he's going to do it. As soon as all the other relatives leave. He told Monica, though, who was surprisingly blase about it. She either has nerves of steel or a brain of tapioca. I'm putting my money on the tapioca, myself. I think Dad has figured it all out, anyway. He'll be okay. It's Joanne and her oblivious dithering that I'm worried about.", "input": "", "output": "I can see why."}, {"instruction": "Gods, if Malcolm ever meets Dad, I think Dad would find his son being gay tame fare compared to this tall, dark, and surly weird man his daughter's bedding down with. Herald the Horrible in full bloom. I can just see the showdown. Gunfight at the Dominant Male corral. Why do men all have to act like that?", "input": "", "output": "Not all men do, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll rephrase that. Why is it that all men in my life, save Jonny and you, have to act like they own any female that falls under their sphere of authority? I am perfectly capable of winding my way through the bullshit all by myself without some testosterone-laden man beating off the baddies with a stick. What if I want to beat the baddies myself? Eh? They don't want to hear that. Did you ever wonder why the heroine of all those fairy tales was never anything but a simpering maiden? It's simple. If a man-hero has a sidekick, it is either a smaller, weaker man, or a stronger, smarter woman. They put the strong woman on the same level as the weak man. And of course, the strong female who is more or less the Man-Hero's equal is always pining away for love of the Man-Hero, who never notices her. Instead the Man-hero is staring into the vacant baby-blue eyes of the simpering rescued maiden. The hero doesn't fall in love with his sidekick. It just doesn't work that way. You have to be a weakling if you want the strong man, or he will make you feel weak and ineffectual until you are the weakling anyway.", "input": "", "output": "I'd never thought about it that way, but you have a point."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.

How's the studying going?"}, {"instruction": "It's going. Where it's going, I'm not entirely sure. I'm procrastinating a little.

Extremely early. And she's staying in my apartment.", "input": "", "output": "I see. How is that working out?"}, {"instruction": "One weird thing after another. First of all, I come home from work and the place has been cleaned. I mean spotless. Now, normally I wouldn't complain about this. However, I had notes and papers and Xeroxes strewn hither and yon for my term papers. Yes, papers. Plural. And when I got home from work they were gone. Grandma walks out of the kitchen, plants her hands on her hips, and says one word: \"Clean.\" Then she goes on to inform me that I live like a pig in German. At least I think that's what she said. Who knows?", "input": "", "output": "What happened to the papers?"}, {"instruction": "I still haven't found them. She insists that she didn't throw them away.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Oh, that's just the beginning.", "input": "", "output": "Really? Now I'm intrigued. What else happened?"}, {"instruction": "She chased Malcolm out of my apartment with a meat cleaver.", "input": "", "output": "She didn't!"}, {"instruction": "I wish I was kidding, but I'm not. Malcolm has a habit of dropping in unannounced. If it isn't late at night and I'm home, I usually leave the door unlocked, in case Jonny or whoever stops by.

Her first name's Bessa, then?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Weird, huh? I tried to find it in a book of names and their meanings and couldn't. Her father was a poet, so I think he just made it up because he liked the way it sounded. Depending on how into the beat poets you were, you might have vaguely heard of him.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not, really, so let's skip it. Now, you were in this bar..."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah. Okay, well, Bessa is playing darts with another of her friends, I'm just sitting at the bar, cursing the sick mastermind who came up with the concept of seasonal beers so I can't get a double-bock when I want one. Talking to the bartender, who was really very nice and just nodded and smiled as I rambled, which I am wont to do. I go home later, and Malcolm is waiting outside. He pulls me down the stairs--Malcolm has the basement studio, I have the first floor. He then proceeds to tell me that my grandmother, the woman who will not even squish a spider, picked up a six inch meat cleaver and screamed at him in German. I guess she thought he was a burglar or something. He said he was actually frightened of her.", "input": "", "output": "Wonderful. Now if we can just keep your grandmother stationed in the kitchen with a meat cleaver..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "I'm just kidding, Chris.

The Dosy Posies or something like that--I was only half-listening when Malcolm started growling about it. Anyway, they gave Malcolm tickets and backstage passes, so he invited Jonny and me to go with him. Jonny's underage, but Malcolm says that we're on the guest list so it won't matter. What's the matter, Doctor? You look like your shirt collar is suddenly too tight and your head's going to explode. Would an egg roll make you feel better?", "input": "", "output": "No, no...I'm all right. Please, continue."}, {"instruction": "Well, Malcolm seems to be a lot less enthusiastic about seeing his friends perform than I thought he would be. He just sort of growled that he had to go, and he'd like to bring Jonny and I if we wanted to come too. Jonny absolutely glowed when I told him, and I can't very well disappoint my baby brother, so I guess we're going.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm...so you and Malcolm are officially a couple, more or less?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I guess so. Not really. It's kind of complicated actually...", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he handed me one of his rings, said he thought it would look nice on my hand. But it's too big to wear anyplace but on my thumb. I suppose one way of looking at it is like we were in high school and he just gave me his class ring to wear, but Malcolm is no meatheaded football player. Instead he's a hotheaded martial artist. He's also more than a little posessive, I've noticed. I'm beginning to think I should cool things off. It can be so frustrating though. Because every time I think I've had enough and I want out, he does something that's either really tender or just turns me on a whole lot. All I can think of is, \"Here we go again.\" Same shit Kevin started pulling. But Kev took a lot longer going about it, and he's not nearly as odd as Malcolm is.", "input": "", "output": "When you say he's odd, why am I hearing dangerous?"}, {"instruction": "I'd be lying if I told you he was an absolute angel, Doctor. He scares me sometimes. He's hinted at why he had to leave New York, and it sounds like he could be in a lot of trouble. The perverse part is, it thrills me in a way. I guess I'm substituting one sort of adrenaline rush for another. I already know he's a criminal.", "input": "", "output": "Uh, what sort of crime are we talking about here?"}, {"instruction": "Not murder. At least I don't think so.", "input": "", "output": "You don't think so. Great."}, {"instruction": "I know I'm being an idiot, but I can't seem to help myself. Have you ever just had this urge to do something totally inappropriate and possibly dangerous, to just cut loose and live in the dark for awhile?", "input": "", "output": "Not quite to the same extent, but I know the impulse you're talking about."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes I take a look at the situation and say to myself, \"What the hell am I doing?\" I would like a stable secure relationship with an intelligent thoughtful man. Yes, I would. I know it's hard to believe. Someone with a good job, family-oriented; someone I can trust and depend on to be a good partner and help me raise a family, because eventually I do want a family. But right now I feel like I want to have at least one more fling, throw caution to the wind, live in the whole 'bad-boy clich\u00e9.' I don't think it's so wrong to want that. One more wild dance before settling down and being the good little wife, mother and teacher. This could give me something to write about for the rest of my life, and I intend to enjoy it.", "input": "", "output": "There's nothing that says that you have to live the domestic life, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I know that, Doctor. But I want to have it. I want the adoring husband and the two kids and the black Lab in the backyard, and Lancelot as an adult purring in my lap. It's not that I don't. I just want to know what I'm giving up, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Just a normal mundane little sitcom lifestyle? This from the same woman who railed not too long ago about practicality as opposed to art? What does that smile mean?"}, {"instruction": "Just that you underestimate me, Doc. The life that I'm describing will be the life according to me. The husband probably won't be something staid like an accountant or lawyer, but a bit more funky. The children raised on fairy tales and music, rather than MTV. You know what I mean? Like looking at a typical family only idealized for my personality. I'm not someone who can be entirely domesticated. I'll probably get kicked off the PTA committee for saying that the principal is a narrow-minded bigot or something. Whew, that was deep. I'm really starting to get too philosophical sometimes. It's like there are two voices inside me, one daring me to go wild and push things until they break. That side likes Malcolm a whole lot. The other side thinks that I need to find a nice architect or engineer or something else Dad would approve of and stop this nonsense that could get me hurt. It gets so tiring. And no, I don't actually hear the voices, Doctor. That was just a metaphor.", "input": "", "output": "I believe you.

No one is, entirely."}, {"instruction": "Damn close to it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, if you say so."}, {"instruction": "I'm also stubborn.", "input": "", "output": "That I can believe."}, {"instruction": "Tut tut, such a smartass. Anyway, I brought the notebook finally. You can read it if you want to, but I take no responsibility for anything you may see in there. I also apologize if some of it makes no sense, because it's very stream of consciousness in its style. Sometimes my conciousness stream is not the most fun place to be. It gets decidedly muddled.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure that I'll get by. How has the panic business been?"}, {"instruction": "Read all about it. It is finals season, and business is booming in the panic market. I'm ashamed of myself, though. I must admit it. I fell off the wagon the other night.", "input": "", "output": "Fell off, or jumped off."}, {"instruction": "More like dove off, right into a lake of cappucino. At least I'm off the hardcore stuff, right?", "input": "", "output": "True. Were you studying?"}, {"instruction": "You guessed it. Curled up in a corner of the Roma with Keats. It was a happy evening. I love the Romantic poets. But I'm going to pack up my cartons here and go home. We're almost out of time.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Chris. I'll see you next week. We can talk about the journal then."}, {"instruction": "All right, then. Have a good one, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Chris. How are you feeling today?"}, {"instruction": "Listen, can we kind of skip the pleasantries for now?

What's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Friday night.", "input": "", "output": "Did something happen?"}, {"instruction": "It only turned into the biggest cluster fuck you can possibly imagine, Doctor. It was a nightmare.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, we went to that concert I was telling you about, the one that Malcolm got the tickets for from his friend. Friend--yeah right. Anyway, the band was all right. It's not really my kind of music, but they didn't suck either. Mal had backstage passes, so the three of us--Malcolm, Jonny and I--we headed backstage after the performance. That's where the trouble started. Apparently Malcolm had a relationship with this underage chit in the band, and she turned up pregnant and insists it's his, and he insists it's not. So she drags him off to talk it out, while Jonny is falling deeply in lust with this pretty blond guitarist-boy from the band. I'm just sort of chatting with everyone, and all of a sudden the two of them--Malcolm and the wench--are screaming obscenities at each other. Another girl tries to calm things down, and the wench slaps her, and things just got worse from there.", "input": "", "output": "They got worse?"}, {"instruction": "I know it sounds like they couldn't possibly have gotten any worse, but believe me they did.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the screaming match got louder and louder. Meanwhile, I'm hearing shit about Mal from his buddies in the band that is beginning to seriously worry me. I knew he was hotheaded, but what they were telling me about him made it sound like it goes past hotheadedness and curves into pure rage. Plus, this damned ring he gave me apparently is some sort of symbol of his staking a permanent claim. Great, like I need his possessiveness together with everything else going on in my life. When I mentioned giving it back, these guys just laughed. It's not that easy, they told me. He has to take it back himself.  Next thing I know, the wench kicks Malcolm right in the balls, and he stoically blocks and immobilizes her with some of his karate stuff. Didn't look like he tried to hurt her, he was just keeping her from causing any other damage. Then in come the police. Malcolm is cuffed and all that, and this wench starts blubbering about how she won't press charges and so on. So he was released later, but I wasn't around.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "The people in the band were really nice to Jonny and I...well, all except for the wench of course. This other girl--Eliza is her name I think--gave me her card and told me to e-mail her if I wanted some answers.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "I'll get to that in a minute. I should tell you about the rest of the evening first.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, okay."}, {"instruction": "So the token drag queen in the band invites me and Jonny to come back to her place for drinks with the others. Jonny was not quite ready to be torn away from his object of worship despite the circumstances, so we went along for the ride--didn't have many options, actually, as Malcolm had driven us there. I got completely lit up on screwdrivers, and had a very deep conversation with Anders--the drag queen--about the nature of love and other examples of the Almighty's sick sense of humor. It was nice to have a shoulder to cry on, even if it was just for the evening. I passed out on his couch about five in the morning, and woke up around two the next day with a very nice, quiet looking little man standing over me and asking if I wanted some orange juice. It was Phillip, Anders' significant other. Jonny had already gone home; he'd gotten a ride with the one sober person at the gathering. So Anders and Phillip drove me home, and I went upstairs and apologized to my grandmother, who was certain that Malcolm had killed me. He might as well have given how bad that hangover was.", "input": "", "output": "And that was your evening?"}, {"instruction": "That was my evening.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds eventful."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, tell me about it.", "input": "", "output": "What's your situation with Malcolm now?"}, {"instruction": "There really isn't one. I haven't seen him--not for his lack of trying. The police released him after the underage tart refused to press charges, and there was a note on my door when I got home. I ignored it. Then he tried calling but I let the machine pick it up. He knocked but I wouldn't answer. I just can't face him yet, not until I have a better idea of what to do. He said he loved me on the answering machine when he called. A week ago that might have stirred in me some sort of positive emotional reaction. Now it just makes me feel scared, and sort of attracted to him in a perverse sort of way. That's what creeps me out most of all--the sick thrill of it all. I don't understand it, Doctor. Am I stupid?", "input": "", "output": "I've always thought of you as a very intelligent woman..."}, {"instruction": "Am I insecure? A Wimp? Am I someone who's afraid to take charge and stand up for herself and others?", "input": "", "output": "Hardly."}, {"instruction": "Unattractive, then?", "input": "", "output": "Far from it."}, {"instruction": "Then I could definitely do better than to be caught in this situation. So what's the problem, then? If I'm an intelligent, educated, assertive person, how did I get stuck here? How could my judgement have been so clouded? I feel like a goddamned fool, and I hate feeling that way. I'm so used to being on top of things, used to having everything pulled together and being two steps ahead of everyone else. I just don't understand, and I feel helpless and almost naked, vulnerable like that. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells. My confidence has been pretty much shot full of holes.", "input": "", "output": "You knew Malcolm had a past--part of your attraction was to that bad boy side of him.  All that really happened to you was that you were with a guy who was in a fight and got arrested during a rock concert.  I think what really got hurt was your pride, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Pride? Pride is traditionally the downfall of the tragic hero in literature. Look at Oedipus, and King Lear. My pride, that whole mindset that I can handle anything that life throws at me, the sheer arrogance that lead me to think I was so much smarter and more controlled than everyone else, that I would never let myself be taken advantage of, has been my downfall.

Please don't cry, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. It'll ruin my makeup and my eyes will get all red and puffy. Besides, I never cry.

Malcolm's actually college-educated--graduated with a degree in computer science. Well, the papa-in-law-to-be apparently had megabucks, and dear daughter turned up dead. Broken neck, but she hadn't fallen or anything. She was just dead on the living room floor. Malcolm was immediately suspect number one, due to his martial arts skill and bad temper. For some reason or other, he skipped town after that. Eliza said that he told her he didn't do it, that he was being set up to take the fall and it had to do with some sort of underworld connection to his dead fianc\u00e9e's family.

Be ready to lose all respect for me.", "input": "", "output": "I doubt that will happen."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, I slept with him again.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Yup, I thought that would make you happy.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so what happened?"}, {"instruction": "I went down to return the ring; he was coming in, I went in for tea. He apologized about the scene at the club, explaining that he and the underage wench had had a brief assignation before he had come across me, and that it was virtually impossible for him to have fathered her child because he never had unprotected sex with her, and he intends to demand blood testing if she wants to stick him with paternity. Yay rah. I was thinking a bit more rationally about the whole evening by that time. It was the bit about committing murder and being a fugitive that really bugged me. We were sitting on the couch, and the next thing I know, he's holding my hand. Just like we were teenagers at the movies on a Saturday night date. He was really slow and gentle about the whole thing, like he was a totally different person. It seemed more natural to him, too. It always seemed like that, though. The violence he displayed at other moments--except when he took after Kevin--seemed almost contrived. So afterwards, I fell asleep downstairs with him in his apartment, and when I wake up he's already gone for work. But he left me a rose along with fresh orange juice and bagels from the deli down the street. I was lying there considering my dilemma when I heard the answering machine pick up. I guess he turned off the ringer on the phone so it wouldn't wake me. It was a female voice, older, warm and motherly, definite a New Yorker's accent, talked really fast: \"Michael, it's Mom. Just calling to see how you were, but you're probably at work. Call me back when you get home. Oh, Elise Jacobsen said to tell you hello, and that she hopes you're doing well. I saw her in the market. I told her that you were doing a lot better and that you had a girlfriend, finally. She said that it was about time, two years was a long time to grieve. Anyway, I'm running your tape out so I'll leave you be. Call me, Honey. Love you!\" I played and replayed that message so many times that I memorized it. I can't understand it. Could it have been a wrong number? And wouldn't the answering machine message have given that away if it was? Gods, Doc. I'm really confused now.", "input": "", "output": "Understandably so."}, {"instruction": "What reasons could he have had for doing something like this?", "input": "", "output": "Let's consider the possibilities. Say his girlfriend really was murdered. It's entirely possible that he felt the need to become someone else, to get away from New York where all his memories were."}, {"instruction": "Like he's creating his own mythology.", "input": "", "output": "Right.  If he were really on the lam, he probably wouldn't be getting long distance calls from his mother."}, {"instruction": "But he said he loved me. Didn't he think that this would catch up with him sooner or later, that sometime I would catch on to all the bullshit?", "input": "", "output": "It's possible he thought to break the news to you slowly when you were already committed to him."}, {"instruction": "Or in an asylum. Gods, this is making me crazy.", "input": "", "output": "I understand your confusion."}, {"instruction": "Do you think I should confront him?", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to salvage the relationship? To try to work past this and move on together?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Probably not. But I'm not sure.", "input": "", "output": "If you do, I'd suggest talking to him. This is something that has to be confronted if you're going to continue the relationship. If you're not, I would advise just breaking things off clean, moving out when your lease is up, and start fresh with a new place. This has all taken quite a toll on you."}, {"instruction": "What I don't understand is how he could have so completely buffaloed everyone who knew him--all the guys in the band, even Eliza to some extent, although all she knew was what he told her, and she said that she tried not to make judgments.", "input": "", "output": "You still talk to her, then?"}, {"instruction": "Had lunch with her yesterday. She's in therapy too, though I don't know with whom. She's having man problems as well--her ex is a real prick. I suggested journal writing as a wonderful catharsis.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad it's working out so well for you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's certainly helped. Anyway, Sarah and Gavin are waiting for me, so I'm going to have to get going.", "input": "", "output": "Oh really? They're in town now, then?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Sarah was the one who gave me the courage to get my hair cut off. And she was the first to tell me it looked great afterwards. So Grandma Strauss is out of the apartment for now. She's staying at Sarah's condo, which Sarah kept for business and recreational purposes when she moved to San Diego. The nice part is that if I can find a roommate to split the rent, Sarah says she will rent the place to me so I can get out of that cramped little studio. Anyway, I'm going to go. Thanks, Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "No problem, Chris. Take care of yourself."}, {"instruction": "No problem. I know I'm early, but I was getting restless and edgy--I had to get out of the house. Without school to go to now, I'm not always sure what to do with myself.", "input": "", "output": "That's right. Congratulations, Chris! How does it feel to be a college graduate?"}, {"instruction": "Relieved. Very relieved. I'm all set up for fall. I got a job at the local high school, and I'm registered for graduate classes in the evenings.", "input": "", "output": "You're going to be busy."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, tell me about it. But the summer is pretty much wide open. I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet. Besides moving and being Carmichael's indentured servant for his summer classes, I have no real plans.", "input": "", "output": "For you, I doubt that's a comfortable feeling."}, {"instruction": "Funny, that's exactly what Eliza said.", "input": "", "output": "Anyway, how are you feeling? I would think that with school being over for you, your panic attacks are less of a problem."}, {"instruction": "Yes and no. I find myself suspecting at times that I have a project that isn't quite done.  And just as I'm thinking that I'm too busy to get to it and that I'll lose points for not getting it done on time, I remember that I can't have an undone project because I'm done with school. I guess it's like a person who's foot has been amputated still feeling tingles in the foot that's no longer attached to his leg, you follow me?", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  I had problems getting used to the idea that I was no longer at school as well."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's not exactly a pleasant feeling. It was, however, a pleasant feeling to finally get all of my family members the hell out of the area and back where they belong.", "input": "", "output": "How did the family reunion go?"}, {"instruction": "Oh!", "input": "", "output": "Judging by your laughter, I'd say it was less than enchanting."}, {"instruction": "Well, Grandma Strauss looked daggers at my father, my father looked daggers at my mother's fianc\u00e9, Joanne looked daggers at my mother, who was oblivious to all the cutlery that was being thrown through gazes. Oh, and to make matters even more amusing, I found out a little family secret: my cousin Gavin is actually my half-brother.", "input": "", "output": "Gavin?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's exactly what I said. Apparently, when Sarah moved in to help Dad take care of me after Mom skipped town, she and Dad had a more personal relationship than anyone besides the two of them was aware of.", "input": "", "output": "Were you the only one told about this, or was there a general announcement?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it was like this. Sarah told Gavin before they came into town.  She figured he should know what he was getting into. Then, the night before graduation, she and Dad told me. I was shaken, not stirred. Gavin and I had a nice long chat about it all and decided that we really weren't too surprised. I mean, every time Sarah comes into town, she and Dad go out together.  She always comes back grinning, and he's a little less gruff for a couple of days until she leaves. So they're obviously still in a relationship that goes beyond a mere friendship. The story goes that Dad wanted to marry her, but she refused him for whatever reason. But for the last twenty years, he has quietly helped support Gavin and helped put him through school. But when Mom overheard us talking, that's when the proverbial turd really hit the turbine.", "input": "", "output": "Oh no. She overheard the conversation between you and Gavin?"}, {"instruction": "Yup. And she immediately flew into a screaming, crying fit and stormed into the living room to confront Sarah and Dad in front of the entire room. This was my graduation party for Christ's sake! Thaddeus, her fianc\u00e9, was a little stricken and completely unable to calm or quiet her--stupid ineffectual little London theater geek. Grandma Strauss, bless her old strudel-making heart, fainted dead away. Sarah and Mom started yelling at each other in parts of sentences--the subject-predicate thing totally went out the window. Jonny started to cry. He'd had a hard week as it was. My Grandpa Herald was wonderful for once.  He very tactfully recognized this as a Strauss family conflict and lead the Heralds out of the room to the food and beer location. Joanne flipped out because she realized that the insinuation was that Dad was screwing around on her. So she's screaming at my Dad. Dad's trying to divide his attention between Joanne's ranting and the argument going on between Mom and Sarah. Mom and Sarah are of course still screaming at each other. Jonny is bawling, leaving Gavin and I staring at each other in disbelief. Except Monica who, for once, came through when she was really needed. She turned her attention to fanning and otherwise trying to revive my grandmother. I almost liked her at that moment.", "input": "", "output": "Eventful day.  I'm sorry about your graduation party, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, shit happens.", "input": "", "output": "So how are things now?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. The final score on the family disaster is that Dad has been evicted from the family homestead, pending Joanne decision about just what she wants to do about him. It doesn't help that he's staying at Sarah's condo in Berkeley, for now. But Sarah is safely back in San Diego. Whether or not she and Dad are going to continue their...assignations, I don't know. Jonny has pretty much taken up semi-permanent residence in my apartment. He can't stand to be around our parents' place right now, seeing as both parents are no longer there, and Joanne is wandering around weeping and wailing like a restless ghost. What a wimp. So I traded one family roommate for another. Poor Grandma. I don't think she'll ever be the same. Dad took me to lunch again and we had a long talk. I told him that I wasn't angry with him or Sarah, and that he needed to decide what he wants to do. He obviously considers Joanne to be merely functional and he seems to have genuine feelings for Sarah. He said that Sarah was everything that he wished my mother could have been, but that he knew that she would never marry him even if he and Joanne were to divorce. She's too independent. He also doubts that he and Joanne will actually divorce, as she is fond of her big house and stable upper-class lifestyle. She'll no doubt get a huge vulgar piece of jewelry and be purring inside of a couple weeks. So that's it.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Chris. I guess your graduation didn't turn out exactly as expected. I see now why you responded to my questions about it with limited enthusiasm."}, {"instruction": "It wasn't exactly the exhilarating time that it could have been, no.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it was probably more exhilarating than most similar affairs, but I understand."}, {"instruction": "And to add to the pile, another interesting tidbit...", "input": "", "output": "I know that look. I feel a Malcolm story coming on."}, {"instruction": "Oh, so perceptive. You're right.", "input": "", "output": "All right, give me the update."}, {"instruction": "Well, I thought a lot about what we discussed last time I was here. I decided that, at the very least, there was a big open-ended spot that was going to be extremely bothersome later on. So I decided to pinch it off before it could sprout.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "I went down to talk to him.", "input": "", "output": "Um, did you...?"}, {"instruction": "No, Doctor. I didn't sleep with him this time.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "It was funny. Very funny. I go down and knock on the door and a stranger answers. Malcolm's hair, Malcolm's voice, Malcolm's body. But this stranger had removed every facial piercing and shaved off the goatee, and was dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. I met Michael, the man behind the image. And it was something of a revelation.", "input": "", "output": "Then the message you overheard wasn't a mistake."}, {"instruction": "Nope. No mistake. His full name is Michael Malcolm Drake, Malcolm is his mother's maiden name. He prefers Malcolm usually, even though his family calls him Michael or Mike. He really did graduate with a computer science degree. His fianc\u00e9e really was murdered in her parents' house. And her father really was tied to shady dealings. But he had nothing to do with it and was never even a suspect. He grieved hard for a long time, hating who he was without his girlfriend and being sure he would never feel any sort of love again. So he morphed himself into the brooding, dour man of mystery that we all know and want to hit. He became someone else and headed for the opposite side of the country, where no one would know him as anything else.", "input": "", "output": "Where he met a certain Berkeley student with curly hair and a way with words..."}, {"instruction": "See, you follow the story well. It came to pass that he developed feelings for this girl, but worried that she was attracted to the image of the dangerous bad boy, which she sadly was. He didn't drop the image even when it  became very difficult, because he feared losing her. His assignation with a certain young tramp came back to haunt him.  And he had to struggle to maintain his connection with his new paramour. Then it all flew apart with an accidentally overheard message from a loving mother. Game, set, match. It's a wrap, as they say in L.A.", "input": "", "output": "And did this girl understandingly accept the real man behind the facade who claimed to care about her?"}, {"instruction": "You can bet your funky neckties that she didn't. She called him several creative insulting names using words that her Lit professor never taught her and stomped back upstairs to cry into her cat's fur.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So it's over."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. No more Malcolm stories. I'll give you some peace and let you be a shrink instead of Dear Abby. We can talk about more mature and less soap opera-ish things next time.", "input": "", "output": "You know that you can talk about..."}, {"instruction": "...whatever I want. I know that, Doc. And I appreciate it. It's my nickel, as they say.", "input": "", "output": "That's not what I meant and you know it."}, {"instruction": "Of course I know. Don't look so wounded. If I thought that you only listened because I was paying you by the hour to do so, I would have been out the door long, long ago. You're not just the Doc, Doc. You're a friend, too.

Goodbye, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Greetings, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, my..."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I know it looks awful. You should see the other guy. Before you start freaking out, let me explain.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Chris. Maybe you'd better explain."}, {"instruction": "Okay. So it comes to pass that I go over to hang with my friend Eliza, she wants me to meet her new boyfriend and stuff. She's all nervous, like the kind of jitters you get when you're in high school and the guy you have had a crush on since third grade is coming over for dinner. Well, she's doing something in the kitchen when someone materializes at her door. I go answer, assuming it's her new man, and it turns out to be her old one. Jesus. And I thought Kevin was unbalanced. He demands imperiously to see Liz and I use my massive powers of deduction and figure out who he is. Ta da! I certainly earned my Super Sleuth Decoder ring. Anyway, I tell him to go away. Then I tell him more forcefully to go away. Finally, as he is mumbling mantras about how he must talk to Eliza, I try to close the door in his face. And he forced it back open, wailed something about me trying to keep them apart, and nailed me. Kerboom. I've never been hit before, at least not really. Needless to say, it was a shock.", "input": "", "output": "That particular shade of purplish-green is an interesting look for you."}, {"instruction": "Yes, isn't it lovely? I thought it would particularly impress my father when he comes over for dinner tonight. I'm cooking for the old man. It should be interesting.", "input": "", "output": "You're jumping subjects again."}, {"instruction": "Sorry. Bad habit. Anyway, I wound up sprawled on the floor of the foyer in utter stupefaction and more than a little pain. He goes thundering towards the kitchen and Eliza. I pick myself up, dust myself off, realize that I am fighting mad and I am damn fucking well not going to put up with some oversized Ken doll tagging me in the eye, ruining my mascara, and messing with my friends on top of it all. So, I manage to lurch into the kitchen where good old Puke has Liz pinned up against the wall and he's shrieking into her face about coming back to him. So, I did the only logical thing I could think of.", "input": "", "output": "You called the police and a veterinarian to give your friend's ex a rabies shot."}, {"instruction": "Nope. Chris logic, Doc, not regular logic.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I ran and jumped onto his back and proceeded to try and claw his face off, telling him as I did so that if he didn't let Eliza go, I was going to rip off his testicles and feed them to Eliza's kitten. Just as I was finishing up this impressive bit of dialogue, in walks Eliza's new man. Peter, I think his name is. Poor guy.", "input": "", "output": "Uh oh."}, {"instruction": "Uh oh is right. But the guy was a trooper. He immediately set about distracting Puke, and Puke let Eliza go. Puke thunders over to pound on Peter, and Eliza faints. I let go of my death grip on Puke and set about trying to rouse Liz back to the waking world and call the cops at the same time. Then, another in a long-line of bizarre coincidences, guess who walks in?", "input": "", "output": "Your father. Eliza turns out to be his daughter, too."}, {"instruction": "No, no, no! Have you no vision, man? One of these things is not like the other! Who have I talked about in many many sessions that is in league, well sort of, with the whole situation?", "input": "", "output": "That would be Malcolm. Michael. Whatever. Him."}, {"instruction": "Good. Whew, I was afraid I was losing you there for a minute. So Malcolm/Michael takes stock of the situation--Liz passed out, me with an eye the color of an eggplant, and Peter being pounded on, and proceeds to really trounce the dog snot out of Puke. I don't even know what Malcolm was doing there, but at the time I was too relieved to question it at all. Besides, it was a beautiful thing. The cops arrived to see Malcolm holding Puke down, grinding his face into the linoleum. Peter was most likely bleeding internally from all the gut punches, and Liz was still in La La land. So in come the paramedics. And that's my story.", "input": "", "output": "That's a very interesting story, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Hey, don't shoot the messenger. The Herald, if you will. Is that a pun in my pocket...", "input": "", "output": "So the final score of the afternoon was..."}, {"instruction": "Puke got arrested and got slapped with a big old happy restraining order, Peter split after he talked to the cops, Liz recovered, sadder yet wiser, and I am still sporting the mark of a friend's psychotic ex. Case closed.", "input": "", "output": "And Malcolm?"}, {"instruction": "It was kind of strange, Doc. After all this went down, and Eliza's parents were there and she was in her hospital room more or less patched up, I was left just sort of standing in the lobby with Malcolm. All the adrenaline left my body in one big whoosh, and I started to cry. Made my eye sting. I think I've done more bawling in the last month than in the last five years before that. Anyway, I'm just kind of hanging my head, totally oblivious to everything, and arms come around me. Really tentatively, but there. I guess if I'd been thinking about it, I would have shoved him away. But I wasn't, and for some reason it just felt really good to have him holding me like that. I felt...I don't know. It's hard to explain. It was different than before. But he gave me a ride home, and now I don't know what is going on with him at all. I haven't seen him since Monday when this all happened.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.

Now are you trying to tell me that I am doing the wrong thing?", "input": "", "output": "No, I'm not. I just think you should probably talk things out with him."}, {"instruction": "Listen, how do I know that this is the real him this time? I don't! He spent so much time lying to everyone because he couldn't face the real world, and now that he's decided to come back from whatever fantasy-land he was living in before, it's all hail the conquering hero, and I'm the wicked woman who's breaking his heart. Well, I have had it with getting my heart broken! And I know that I could genuinely fall in love with him the way he is now, that's what's sick about it.

Jonny arranged for Greg to pick him up at my place, all the better to keep in the closet for a bit longer.

They have a marvelous evening together. I have never heard Jonny so giddy, bless his prissy little button-down collars. The next day, this kid sends Jonny roses at my apartment. Roses, be god! I told Jonny that Greg was probably a keeper if he was getting flowers after the first date. He just blushed and cooed about how wonderful Greg was. Anders and Phillip were hanging around, and Anders gave Phil this really scathing look, saying that he never got any flowers. He went on to inform the room that the last present that Phil had given him was a grill pan for the oven. Phil looked kind of sheepish and said it was a really high-quality grill pan and did all sorts of neat stuff, and Anders said that wasn't the point, and they got into it there in the living room.

Lots of windows, so I won't get claustrophobic. But there is this teacher in the room down the hall from mine. His name is Aaron Fraiser, and he teaches advanced placement history.

It went up for sale and they went in on it together, making some changes and remodeling the place into basically two halves, bigger than apartments but not quite town-house material.

I don't know. I'm a cynic by nature, and it's very uncomfortable for me to even suggest such a thing might be possible. But it sounds like every ghost story that I've ever read.", "input": "", "output": "Calm down, Chris. I don't think you're crazy. But there could be perfectly normal explanations for all of that."}, {"instruction": "I hope so. Because my friends aren't providing any helpful ideas in this situation. Bessa wanted to perform some sort of a ritual to drive the entity out into the next world. Anders made some pretty graphic comments about vicarious spirit sex that I don't care to repeat; I think he's been watching too much late night television. Malcolm seems to have taken up a sentinel-like position in my living room, protecting me from the scum of the netherworld. I am beginning to think that if I'm not crazy, then all this is going to make me crazy. I hope that there is a reason for all this. Old water pipes come to mind. That was Malcolm's suggestion. But it didn't stop him from loitering around my couch for the better part of an evening when he was supposed to be taking me out on a date.", "input": "", "output": "Old pipes could well be a good reason for all that's been happening. So you're dating Malcolm again?"}, {"instruction": "Dating being the operative word. I laid a lot of ground rules for our interactions. If he lies to me about one more thing, no matter how small, it's over. No tears, no yelling, no recriminations, just out the door. And we're talking a lot. I basically have to get to know him all over again, since all I knew was a big facade. The thing is, I think I like him better this way. It's all been pretty normal. But normal in a good way, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Exactly. I'm glad you're happy, Chris."}, {"instruction": "That's just it. I'm not.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not happy. I don't know what it is that's missing, but it was missing even before the wall came down with him, so to speak. He's fun to date, we get along really well now, but I feel like I'm overlooking something. Something important. Something I have missed completely and is going to come up and bite me on the ass when I'm not looking. It reminds me of a guy named Kurt I was hanging around with for awhile when I was a freshman in college.", "input": "", "output": "What was this guy like, then?"}, {"instruction": "Kurt? Ha, ha, ha. Two words come instantly to mind: delusional schizophrenia. The man was completely around the bend, out to lunch, toys in the attic crazy.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, he does sound charming. Go on."}, {"instruction": "Oh-kaaaay...well, for one thing he was a master manipulator. Did you ever talk to someone and know what they were saying was bullshit, but it was such entertaining, poetic bullshit that you just let them go on? That's how it was talking with Kurt. But as I said, he was crazy. I think he owned more weapons than Nazi Germany. He threatened suicide, mentally abused his ex-girlfriend and future wife--those two are the same person, incidentally--and basically attempted to work me over into this little demented club he had going on. But he did have a vivid imagination. I never did determine whether or not he actually believed what he would talk about, but he would go on and on about it. He could be very sweet, romantic, and sexy, but it was all so creepy that after a while I could never feel quite at ease with him. I started seeing someone else, and left him to his delusions. The odd thing is I'm still friends with a couple of people I met through him. Go figure.", "input": "", "output": "So what does this have to do with Malcolm?"}, {"instruction": "I'm getting to that. Malcolm in some ways at first reminded me of Kurt. He had a similar sort of edge without the wildcards, so to speak. But Malcolm came clean and decided to live in the real world. Actually, he never really lived out of it. Kurt lived in his own little Kurt-realm, which was just fine with me. But as far as Malcolm is concerned, I still feel like there's a piece missing here. Kurt just happened to have a lot of pieces missing, most of them in his brain. Malcolm might not have many pieces missing from his brain, but he does have one missing somewhere. And until that piece is found, I'm just not quite comfortable with him as a potential lifemate yet.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. You and Malcolm are starting over, so just take things slowly. It will all work itself out, one way or another."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I hope so. Besides, I'm sure you're tired of hearing Malcolm stories all the time.", "input": "", "output": "No, I'm fine. Really."}, {"instruction": "Oh! Hey, urgent news flash, Herr Doktor...Jonny came out, out, out! And Joanne wigged, wigged, wigged. And Dad's divorcing her over it.", "input": "", "output": "Oh my. Just when things were starting to settle down..."}, {"instruction": "Exactly. Jonny decided that he is seriously in love with Greg, and Greg is in love with him. Jonny's decided to stay in town and go to Berkeley, rather than hike off to the wilds of the frozen north, because Greg is going there, to Berkeley I mean. But Sunday afternoon he sat the parents down and told them the truth. I was there, and so was Monica--who every time I think is an utterly hopeless blonde bimbette, turns around and does something really amazing. Monica and I stood back, waiting for Dad to blow up completely. But he didn't. He stayed cool, looked at Jonny and asked if there was a young man at the moment. Jonny told him yes there was, and Dad just nodded. Then he stands up and--wonder of all fucking wonders--hugs Jonny. Monica and I looked at each other in total stupefication. Dad asked Jonny what he thought Dad was going to say, and Jonny just shugged, looking all teary eyed, and said he hadn't known what to expect. Then Dad told him to be damned careful, because he didn't want to lose Jonny early. Referring to AIDS, I assume, and safe sex. Jonny promised, and Dad turns around and gives me this kind of sheepish grin, and says that he assumed that I'd known about this all along, which of course I did. Meanwhile, Joanne's face is just getting whiter and whiter, and her lips are disappearing, she's pressing them so tightly together. Then the valve blew.", "input": "", "output": "What did she say?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, Doc, it was awful. Poor Jonny. Some of the things that came out of her mouth were so ugly, that I thought the kid would be scarred emotionally for life. She even tried to hit him, but Dad kept his arm around Jonny the whole time, and finally just looked Joanne right in the eyes and told her to get the hell out of his house, because no one was ever going to speak to his son that way. Especially not the mother who should love him no matter what. Then Dad kind of steered Jonny over to me, and told me to take him back over to my place. He and Joanne had things to discuss. I asked Monica to come along, and she did. So the two of us kind of shared the duty of consoling Jonny over Joanne's reaction. And surprisingly enough, on the eve of our parents divorcing, Monica and I bonded. When I took them home later, Joanne was gone. Her Mercedes wasn't in the garage and there was no trace of either her or her stupid little Pomeranian. Dad said he sent her over to a hotel, and he had no doubt that she would go for blood in the divorce, given his infidelity. Monica was welcome to stay at the house for as long as she wanted, of course, but she was planning to move down to L.A. anyway; she's gotten sick of the dorm life and is getting an apartment there. So it looks like the marriage is really over this time. And Dad's a fucking hero in my eyes.", "input": "", "output": "He sounds like quite a man, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Better than I gave him credit for. Anyway, I'm leaving now, Doc. I'm meeting Bessa for drinks this evening, and I'm going to go home and see what the ghost has destroyed first.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds delightful. Take care, and I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Shit, I forgot my journal. I'm sorry, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "I'll live without it for a week. But remember it next time."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. I felt a need to escape reality. So I look like Dr. Seuss on an acid trip today. How is life for the young shrink about town?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Right."}, {"instruction": "What's wrong? Not getting out much?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I...hey, wait. This is your therapy session, not mine."}, {"instruction": "I don't mind, if you want to talk...", "input": "", "output": "No, that's okay. Not very professional, and besides I'm here to help you, not the other way around."}, {"instruction": "Details, details, petty little details...okay, okay, you can stop giving me that horrid Herr-Doktor frown. I'll behave.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it's not an issue of you behaving...you're getting me off track again. Stop that."}, {"instruction": "Hey, you did it yourself that time, so don't blame me. But anyway, on to my rather mundane week. I am seriously beginning to believe that these kids in Carmichael's summer class have left their brains at the beach. I graded thirty essays on Saturday afternoon, all of them on the subject of King Lear, and could not find a coherent thought aside from the stuff that they print in Cliff's Notes in any of them. I was so disappointed. Last semester there were some really brilliant kids in his class, and these kids in the summer session are all just in it because they have to take a lit class since the college of arts and sciences says they must be cultured. Blah. It's annoying.", "input": "", "output": "Well, there will be good semesters and bad."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. Still. This stuff set me absolutely on fire when I was first reading it, and I guess I'm having a hard time seeing past that. Of course, I started reading Shakespeare when I was younger.", "input": "", "output": "I know, I remember you saying that."}, {"instruction": "Ah, well. Patience is not one of my virtues, but I'll have to cope.", "input": "", "output": "How's your brother?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Joanne hasn't come back yet. Monica says that she intends to completely disown Jonny: \"I have no son\" and all that melodramatic bullshit. The divorce is in the works. Dad is serious about this one. He and Joanne are actually communicating through lawyers already. In a way it's kind of sad, but I also think that it's no more than the bitch deserves. I just hope that Dad doesn't get taken to the cleaners; he's planning on retiring early. By Thanksgiving, actually, if all goes as planned.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds good. What is he planning on doing afterwards?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he'll still do some work with finance. He's discussed consulting on a part-time basis, freelance. But he wants to travel and relax. He's looking at sailboats. I think he just really wants a vacation.", "input": "", "output": "As hard as you've said he works, that is entirely reasonable."}, {"instruction": "And in my opinion, long overdue. But anyway, back to the Jonny situation. Dad decided to put on an apron and have a meet the kids' boyfriends night. He grilled steaks, and Malcolm came over. Jonny brought Greg, too, so it was a pretty big event that, thank god, did not turn into a disaster.", "input": "", "output": "Your father met Malcolm?"}, {"instruction": "And, get this, he was, in Herald the Horrible's own words, \"Very impressed with the young man. He's got a good job, with plenty of room for advancement, and a promising future.\" Dad also thought that Mal was intelligent and responsible. Of course, he doesn't know about the catastrophe a month or two past. Greg and Dad hit it off really well, too. Greg's majoring in business, so they had lots to talk about.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you had a lovely evening."}, {"instruction": "Perfect. Dad and I have gotten along really well lately. It makes me wish that it had always been this easy.", "input": "", "output": "I've gotten the impression from our earlier conversations that you and he had some definite conflicts."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Dad and I had some different views, all right. I think I became a liberal just to make him angry. I was rebellious intellectually rather than going out and getting drunk, high, whatever. But he's mellowed, and so have I.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I think that's true. You've mellowed even from the time that I first met you. You look and act...I don't know..."}, {"instruction": "Grown up? Well, when I'm not wearing this silly hat, that is.", "input": "", "output": "Even with the hat. You must have been quite an interesting teenager."}, {"instruction": "Hell on wheels. I'll bet you were the quiet one.", "input": "", "output": "More often than not. So, how's your resident ghost?"}, {"instruction": "You're mocking me, aren't you?", "input": "", "output": "No. Well, teasing you."}, {"instruction": "I gave it a name.", "input": "", "output": "You named the ghost?"}, {"instruction": "Yup. Well, if it turns out that my fears and neurotic imaginings are unfounded, I'll have named the house. Its name is Bill.", "input": "", "output": "Bill the ghost."}, {"instruction": "Yes, Bill the Ghost. Capital G, please. Stop that laughing!", "input": "", "output": "I see. Well, what made you settle on Bill as a name for your resident ghost?"}, {"instruction": "Good all-purpose name. Bill. Bill the Ghost. I just like the way it sounds for some reason. Anyway, do you want to hear about my adventure over at the Irish pub in Berkeley this weekend?", "input": "", "output": "Adventures in Irish pubs are usually amusing. Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "This was, too. I'm down there sitting at the bar next to, of all people, Anders, who was in full regalia. That guy has a really perverse sense of humor. I have my nose happily in my second pint of Guinness, Anders is doing shots of whiskey, his husband Phil is sitting next to us quietly sipping a mineral water. I feel this tap-tap-tap on my shoulder, and who should be standing there but Andrew Fraiser, the foxy AP History teacher at my new workplace.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Go on."}, {"instruction": "Well, he and I are chatting, he buys my third pint...I was feeling no pain, which is not unusual if you know anything about Guinness. Anders is making enthusiastic obscene gestures whenever Andrew isn't looking--odd, considering that he was one of the main orchestraters of my reconciliation with Mal. Anders must have been really plowed. Well, this band starts playing these Celtic folk melodies, kind of like the stuff my great-grandpa used to play on his fiddle before his arthritis got too bad. Just a moment before, Andrew and I had been discussing Riverdance, the video with the Irish dancing and music, and we just give each other this really impish grin, and next thing I know we're off in the middle of this crowd of loud happy dancing people. And we are being loud happy dancing people right along with them.", "input": "", "output": "You had a good time, then?"}, {"instruction": "It was great! Andrew is a really, really interesting person. We went to a twenty-four hour cafe afterwards and sat until the sun came up, chatting about everything. I told Andrew the whole story about Malcolm, and he listened and nodded almost as well as you do, Doctor. Anders and Phillip went home early because Anders was on the verge of passing out. Imagine an amazingly tall, African-American drag queen weaving out the door and yelling, \"Erin go Bragh, darlings!\" at the top of his lungs. He was funny, though. Whiskey isn't quite refined enough for him usually, but there was no champagne to be had. Then before he left, he got up and sang with the band. They played the clich\u00e9 drag song, \"I Will Survive,\" with a Celtic beat to it. I have never seen anything so funny! Andrew and I were holding on to the bar to keep from falling down, we were laughing so hard. I love Anders. A more honest, frank, funny person I could not imagine. It gives one a hell of a lot of respect for him.", "input": "", "output": "Yes indeed. And Andrew?"}, {"instruction": "Andrew? Oh, nothing, really. We talked for a long time and that's about it. I have a boyfriend, remember? As foxy as I think the guy is, it's not going to go any further. Besides, he's a co-worker, and I don't believe in mixing business with pleasure.", "input": "", "output": "Probably a good policy. Well, Chris, it seems we're about out of time for the day. Did you remember your journal this time?"}, {"instruction": "Ta-dah! All in a shiny new notebook, all for you. And I have a few pictures but I can't let you keep them.", "input": "", "output": "Is that Lancelot? My, he's gotten..."}, {"instruction": "...huge. I know. I think his mother was a bobcat or something. You need a cat, Doctor. Cats are a good thing. Oh, look at this one. That's the house I'm living in now.", "input": "", "output": "Who is the blonde woman standing next to you? Monica?"}, {"instruction": "No, that's my friend Bessa. Pretty, isn't she?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, very. This must be Jonny and your father."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's them.", "input": "", "output": "You and your brother both look a lot like your father."}, {"instruction": "Yup, I know. They stamped us out of cookie cutters. Well, I'll leave you in peace now. See you next week, Doc! Take care!", "input": "", "output": "You too, Chris. Try to stay as happy as you seem today. You look better than you have in awhile."}, {"instruction": "All right, I suppose. A little confused, a little frustrated, but other than that life is pretty well laid back right now. Again I've hit a lull in the crisis schedule. I have nothing to do, no people to manage. I'm a little down, to tell you the truth.", "input": "", "output": "Why, because your life is relatively calm just now? Your much happier in a crisis than when it's calm."}, {"instruction": "Call it the family curse. I'm only happy when it rains, and all that. You ever listen to Garbage?", "input": "", "output": "Not really my style of music, but I think I know the song you're talking about."}, {"instruction": "Yup, that about sums it all up.", "input": "", "output": "You're not that bad."}, {"instruction": "I know. I'm cute, and that makes it all better.", "input": "", "output": "Very funny. So what's on your mind today?"}, {"instruction": "I'm kind of floating. Debating the merits of taking a trip somewhere.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah? Where did you want to go?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Maybe Ireland, Scotland, British Isles kind of thing. Run through the moors screaming \"Heathcliff!!!!\"", "input": "", "output": "Interesting mental image."}, {"instruction": "I thought you'd like it.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you pick the United Kingdom?"}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "I mean, what is it that is drawing you to that part of the world?"}, {"instruction": "Because I have a sexual fetish for the accents. Don't look at me like that, I'm only kidding. I think I'd like to go there because you see all these pictures of green countryside, and big wide fields, rocky cliffs, ruins of ancient castles, sheep...", "input": "", "output": "Sheep?"}, {"instruction": "Just generally pastoral and peaceful. If I have to breathe smog much longer, I'm going to choke.", "input": "", "output": "I still don't see what sheep have to do with it."}, {"instruction": "Forget the sheep, okay? The point is I need a vacation!", "input": "", "output": "But why would you want to spend it with sheep?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, you are a funny man, aren't you? Ever think of going down to open mike night at the Punchline? The sheep are only there to look at, Doc. Don't sweat the sheep.", "input": "", "output": "There, see? I gave you something to get keyed up about. Do you feel better?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess I do. You know me too well, Doc. One day I will find a way to even the score, just you wait.", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "Whether or not you're my shrink, you're going to get smacked in a minute.", "input": "", "output": "Like it? It's my newest form of therapy."}, {"instruction": "Based on the Smartass Principle, no doubt. Anyway, all kidding aside, I really think that I am going stir crazy.", "input": "", "output": "Is it just restlessness?"}, {"instruction": "I'd be more inclined to call it a general feeling of disgust. I can scarcely stand to look at anyone right now. Jonny, Dad, Malcolm, even Bessa are beginning to wear on my nerves. It's weird, like I feel trapped in a room that's too warm all the time. Stifling. I almost wish I was moving to a new city with a new job, because then I would at least have the feeling that there's something new and exciting going on. I just feel lethargic, like I can't be bothered to put the energy into anything. If I went to England, I could stay with Mom. She'd love it--it would give her a chance to play the doting parent for a week or two. I would have to put up with Thaddeus the twink, but other than that, it might be fun. I heard that they restored the Globe Theatre and are putting on Shakespeare productions in it. Talk about a thrill! I'd get to worship at the altar of the literary god himself and see things as they were meant to be seen. Plus, with Mom and Thaddeus Twinkie-Butt both working in the theatre, I could probably get tickets easy and cheap. Well, relatively speaking.", "input": "", "output": "It seems to me a plan is forming."}, {"instruction": "It might just be at that. Oh, hey look! See?", "input": "", "output": "Is that a real tattoo?"}, {"instruction": "Yup it is. Very real. And I don't mind telling you that it hurt like a bitch.", "input": "", "output": "I'll bet. You didn't have that last Thursday, did you?"}, {"instruction": "Nope. I actually only got it yesterday. You think it's trashy?", "input": "", "output": "Not too terrible. If you had gotten a Harley-Davidson logo or something with the word \"Mother\" on it, I might find that a bit tacky. The Celtic knotwork is actually pretty classy."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I thought so too. I figured if I was going to do it, I might as well get something that wouldn't embarrass me too much in thirty years.", "input": "", "output": "In thirty years everyone your age right now is going to have tattoos and holes in strange places anyway, so it doesn't matter too much."}, {"instruction": "My age, my ass. I can't be too much younger than you.", "input": "", "output": "I'd say more than ten years, easily. I'd have to read your file again to know exactly."}, {"instruction": "I'm twenty-three, if that helps.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, more than ten years. Definitely more."}, {"instruction": "How much more?", "input": "", "output": "I'm thirty-seven. Anyway, tell me about this. I'm intrigued."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, I was out doing some errands, nothing terribly unusual. I'm standing in the checkout line at the grocery store and I start talking to this guy. Looks like your stereotypical tattoo artist. Long ponytail, bandanna, all the ink up and down his arms, but my age, maybe a little older. I start asking him questions, you know how curious I can be. He gave me his card as he was leaving, said if I was interested to stop by and he'd show me his portfolio. I was thinking, \"Yeah, right, it's the tattoo artist's version of etchings.\" But then I got one of my wild impulse things going on, and I decided that I would make Jonny and Greg come with me to the place. In we go, and I was pleasantly surprised. Instead of being grimy and dirty and stuff, it looked like a goddamned dentist's office. Very clean, the autoclave chugging away merrily in the corner, all that good stuff. I found out that Greg has a tattoo as well, and he was telling me about where it hurts the most on the body, stuff like that. So out comes Lance, that's the guy's name. I thought it was a good omen. He starts showing me his artwork, and some of it was really unbelievable. Before I knew it, I had picked out the what and the where I wanted it, and was in the chair. Greg watched him like a hawk, making sure the needles were new and everything was sanitary and clean. Jonny just held my hand and looked a trifle green. It didn't hurt too badly. I was actually really pleased with how it came out.", "input": "", "output": "It is nicer than most I've seen."}, {"instruction": "Cool, I'll take you down there and we'll get you a big one that says Born to Psychoanalyze, or something like that.", "input": "", "output": "I think I'll pass, thank you."}, {"instruction": "The only real problem is that if I ever find a man fool enough to marry me, a backless wedding gown is out.", "input": "", "output": "Why? Your future husband will probably know it's there already."}, {"instruction": "Do you think I want my grandmother to have a heart attack? She had a hard enough time with Malcolm's tattoos! And I don't even want to think about Mom's reaction. She doesn't care if I have one, so long as it's not seen in polite company.", "input": "", "output": "In some cultures, it's considered a rite of passage."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well not in the culture of one mother named Lily Elisabeth Strauss Herald soon to be whatever Thaddeus' last name is, I always forget that. So I wear a non-backless wedding dress. Or get married in jeans on top of a volcano somewhere, which I always thought I would prefer anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Somehow I can see that."}, {"instruction": "See, you appreciate the idea! I mentioned it to Malcolm and he kind of wrinkled his nose. Seems he wants the big gaudy circus with the Catholic priests and the whole nine yards. Ew, ew, ew.", "input": "", "output": "Did anyone ever tell you that you are constantly full of surprises?"}, {"instruction": "I feel it is my sworn duty to keep the rest of the world on it's toes. But I'll bet your patient schedule would be damned boring without me around, wouldn't it?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know about boring, but a good bit of the laughter would be gone, that much is certain."}, {"instruction": "I'll accept that as a yes. Hey, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Do you have any idea where Eliza has been? I haven't been able to get ahold of her.", "input": "", "output": "Um..."}, {"instruction": "Breathe, Doc. Remember to breathe. That's a good Herr Doktor.", "input": "", "output": "I thought you didn't know that I treated her."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I knew. I just didn't think anything of it. It's not like a personal affront that you didn't tell me or anything, because I know you really couldn't. But I'm getting worried about the chick, and I can't really get anything out of her stepfather on the phone. So I was hoping you'd have some idea.", "input": "", "output": "Chris, you must know that I can't say anything, really."}, {"instruction": "I know. I didn't even really want to mention it because I didn't want to give you a complex or anything. But I'm that worried about her. It's not like her to go for so long without calling.", "input": "", "output": "I understand, Chris, and your concern is touching. I can say that she hasn't been injured or something--you don't need to worry about her having been hit by a car or something.  Here's an idea. Why don't you send a card or something nice to her in care of her parents? They'll get it to her, I'm sure."}, {"instruction": "Good idea. Now that I have the advice, forget I said anything. I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that, and I'm sorry. It won't happen again, by unspoken agreement. I know it must put you in a tough position.", "input": "", "output": "It's all right. You were motivated by genuine concern, so I really can't be angry at you. Not that I would be anyway. But...you know what I mean."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. But still, you're a nice guy and everything. I don't want to see you get in ethics trouble.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think it will come to that."}, {"instruction": "Hey, we spent so much time trading smartass comments at the beginning that the time just flew. Speaking of which, I was sort of wondering...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Do you ever think that I'm wasting your time? I mean honestly, I'm sure you have patients with bigger, more worrisome problems than me. And here I walk in, flipping off at the mouth telling you the trivial little details of my life...", "input": "", "output": "Stop. I do not think you're wasting my time, Chris, and more importantly, I don't think I'm wasting yours.  I think our sessions are helping you. I don't think you've mentioned a panic attack in a long while. I think that our sessions are helping you to understand yourself and your priorities better than you could by self reflection.  And that's a pretty good reason to continue therapy."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but...", "input": "", "output": "No buts. I am not going to let you walk out of this office until you promise that you'll walk back in next week. All right?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, okay. Since you insist.

What do you mean, the happiest anyone's been to see you all week? What's wrong?"}, {"instruction": "I'm a bit of a pariah it seems now. Untouchable. Low man on the totem pole. I don't particularly like feeling that way. And after at least a month without a panic attack, I've had two whoppers in the last three days. I'll be glad to start work and have something to bury myself in. I still write, but art is imitating life and it's become less of a catharsis and more like the letters on the screen turning into little imps that mock me constantly, going ha-ha you're one stupid bitch!

It's a long story.", "input": "", "output": "All right, I'm settled."}, {"instruction": "All right. I told you I think that Drew Fraiser and I were part of the same Medieval Rec club back when I was in high school, right? Well, I didn't tell you quite everything there, I'm afraid.

A flirtation, an understanding, an attraction...just a thing. Well, that was one of the main problems when I ran into him at the high school. The attraction hasn't gone away. I didn't recognize him at first because he used to have really long curly brown hair, and he's since cut that off and grown a beard so I couldn't see his face too distinctly. The eyes should have been a clue, as well as the voice, but I didn't realize it at first. He was my first real emotional involvement, really. But I thought things were moving a bit too fast, and I told the girl who introduced us this. That's where the story gets weird.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Nicole, that was her name. Supposedly one of my best friends at the time. She told me all the wrong things about how Drew reacted to the situation.", "input": "", "output": "She lied to you."}, {"instruction": "Hole in one, Doc. She told me that he took the news that I wanted to slow down as an out and out rejection and that he didn't want to talk to me anymore. Which wasn't the case. Then she turned around and told him that I was just having fun, a summer fling and stuff like that, and that I didn't want to talk to him anymore. Which couldn't have been further from the truth if you had tied it to the mast of a ship bound for the Southern Cross. She lied to both Drew and I, and then she was conveniently there to pick up the pieces after I had shattered his heart. What the fuck ever. In a nutshell, she was jealous of the relationship that he and I were forging, and she broke it up in order to transfer his affections to her. It didn't work. She tried everything, threatening suicide, trying to make him jealous. She even got him to marry her by \"forgetting\" to take her birth control pills and ending up pregnant. They're in the midst of a very messy divorce, and their son Duncan is five now. But she could never inspire in him what I did. I know that sounds conceited, but it's not me who said it. It was Andrew. He came over to my house the other day without any notice, sat me down at my kitchen table and we had a long talk.", "input": "", "output": "And he told you all this."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's all a lot to absorb and it's pretty hard to swallow, I know. I don't know what to think about it all either, Doc. I'm so confused, and I feel completely trapped. I think this vacation will be good for me. God knows I need it.", "input": "", "output": "So you're going to visit the sheep after all."}, {"instruction": "Yup. I'm spending a week in London with Mom and Thaddeus El Twinko.", "input": "", "output": "And the sheep crack didn't even earn me a smile. This must be serious."}, {"instruction": "Serious indeed. It's enough to make a girl want to sick up her lunch.", "input": "", "output": "Hopefully we can quell some of that nausea. How do you feel about Andrew?"}, {"instruction": "Drew is pretty amazing. He's brilliant, and utterly romantic. Some of the things he says to me can make my insides turn to absolute jelly. He can also push every one of my buttons as far as turning me on is concerned and he can get me so worked up that I don't even know or care what's going on around me.", "input": "", "output": "Then you've slept with him."}, {"instruction": "No, not exactly. A lot of kissing and cuddling and romantic little whispers. It took an act of supreme willpower not to sleep with him, believe you me. But I'm just not sure of what's going on. I can't shake the feeling that he's looking for another mother for his son--he's fighting for custody--or that he just doesn't want to be alone, or that he is trying to get back at Nicole for all the times she screwed around on him. He tells me that he never stopped loving me, that we'd still be together now if Nicole hadn't interfered. I also have this unreasonable feeling that, in a way, Nicole took more from me than Andrew, that her son should have been mine on some sort of a level. How's that for irrational?", "input": "", "output": "Chris, you've been very deeply hurt, and you're confused. It's all right for you to feel like you do, whether or not you think it's irrational."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but...", "input": "", "output": "But nothing. You know I'm right."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, Doc. I do.", "input": "", "output": "So you have some unresolved emotional issues here with Andrew. I can understand at least wanting some closure. What about Malcolm, though?"}, {"instruction": "Look at these.", "input": "", "output": "Pretty. Are they real?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, most definitely. About a month or so ago we were walking through some shops, and he pulled me into a jewelry store, and I was eyeing them then. He said he wanted to give me a special present, and he wanted to see what I liked as far as jewelry went. He didn't buy them that day, but the other night was five months exactly since the night we met, and he gave these to me as a present. Any man who gives you emeralds is not one to be taken lightly.", "input": "", "output": "Having never been given emeralds by a man, I wouldn't know. But I think I understand the sentiment."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, I was in my apartment with Andrew that afternoon, and things kind of got flaky.", "input": "", "output": "I thought you said..."}, {"instruction": "I did say. That's not what I meant. I was at the house with Drew, and Anders stops by to return some lipstick he borrowed for his performance. The damned man never knocks!", "input": "", "output": "Anders walked in on the kissing and cuddling that you referred to."}, {"instruction": "Well, all he saw was me giving Andrew a hug goodbye, but Andrew had his arms wrapped around me in a slightly more than casually friendly manner, with his face all cozy nuzzled against my hair. So Andrew left, and Anders just stood there and looked at me, tapping his toe on the floorboards with his hands on his hips. I squirmed. I couldn't help it, and I never squirm, Doctor. After a moment Anders lets loose with this huge tirade of accusations, and I started yelling back, I told him the whole story and he wasn't at all sympathetic. He said that I had better tell Malcolm the truth and make up my mind what I wanted, or he would tell Malcolm what he saw. Some friend, huh? He just tucked in his chin and said that he was doing it for my own good, the whole mommy complex: I yell because I care sort of thing. So I pitch a screaming crying hysterical fit and he starts clucking, gives me a hug and wipes my cheeks dry, then he takes me shopping and makes me buy yet another impractical outfit, this one a short skirt made out of this rubbery stuff that I think looks like hefty bags, with this lace up vest type thing to match. It was on sale at least. He's the ultimate bargain hunter. I think he likes to play that I'm his life-size fashion doll--dress it up and fuss with the hair. But he still says that I had better tell Malcolm or it'll be my ass. Tough love again. Then he says that until I do tell him, I'm on my own.", "input": "", "output": "That seems kind of harsh."}, {"instruction": "Well, Malcolm is his friend too. He doesn't want to see either of us get hurt.", "input": "", "output": "So you're going to tell Malcolm what's going on."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah, I owe him that much. I trust Malcolm, Doctor. I know that he'd never screw around on me, that he'll always be there when I need him. I feel secure with him, like I can let my guard down and I don't have to constantly be wary of opening up. At this stage of my life, I feel like that's more important than a torrid, secret love affair chock-full of passionate whispers and romantic canoodling. Damn, though, I wish I could find both in the same man. Now that Malcolm is himself rather than the Malcontent, he's still a great lover, but apparently the real Malcolm is a lot drier, a lot more practical and stationary. He doesn't tell me that I'm beautiful or that I have always held his heart in my hands and how vulnerable that he feels around me. But he is loyal, will cuddle me through a panic attack and not ask me why, rub my stomach when I have cramps, and scratch under the straps of my bra right where it itches. At this point I can't give up that kind of security, because it restored my faith in relationships. Malcolm proved to me that I won't get burned every time I open my heart to someone. Maybe one of these days Andrew will be in a position to offer that same sort of trust, but he just isn't right now. It's not worth it.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds as though you've made a descision here, Chris. And if you want my honest opinion, it's a good one."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doctor. That makes me feel better.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, now as far as the panic attacks are concerned, I'm sure you know the drill. Keep up with the journal, lay off the caffeine...stop rolling your eyes, young lady. Try to relax, and for what it's worth I think this vacation will really help you out. And get some sleep. You look exhausted."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I will. Listen, I know there are about five minutes left on the clock, but if it's all right with you...", "input": "", "output": "Sure, Chris. So you're going to miss next week?"}, {"instruction": "Unless you'd like to fly to London and conduct my session there, yeah. I should be back for it the week after.", "input": "", "output": "All right then. Have fun, and take care of yourself..."}, {"instruction": "Ah, sorry. I know that was probably bending the rules, but I guess I wasn't thinking. I kiss all my friends goodbye. Hey, at least I wasn't wearing lipstick. Damn, Doc, your ears can turn red. Relax, I'm not proposing or anything.", "input": "", "output": "It was just unexpected. I...what are you snickering at?"}, {"instruction": "You. You're overreacting, and you're the color of a pomegranate. I kiss all my friends on the cheek, Doc. If you don't believe me, ask Eliza. It's just a habit of mine, my way of saying goodbye. Later, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Have a good vacation, Christina."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Herr Doktor! Miss me?", "input": "", "output": "Well hello, stranger. You look different."}, {"instruction": "See? I am capable of dressing and acting like an adult on occasion. It's not a part I relish playing, but I play it well. I suppose it's required of me, after all...the teacher, you know. Someone in the classroom has to have a grip on maturity, however tenuous.", "input": "", "output": "I would hope so. How's the teaching working out?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, it's turning out great. Better than I expected. It seems as though these kids might, fates forfend, actually be interested in what I'm teaching. Some of them are really good writers. No one, myself included, really enjoys teaching the rules of grammar, but I refuse to make them diagram sentences. So it's not turning out so bad. It's required by the curriculum, so I spent a few days on it. Then I said, \"Now, an easier way to do this that makes a lot more sense...\" and proceeded to explain it my way. The quiz results were positive enough. We'll see how the section test turns out, but I have pretty high hopes and it's only about three weeks into the semester.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear it. And you seem really excited about it."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I like my students. It was kind of a relief to get there and actually enjoy it. I was almost afraid that I'd get into my own classroom with a group of students for whom I was totally responsible for an entire year and realize that I had spent the last four and a half years of my life training for a profession that I hated. But, thankfully, that was not the case.", "input": "", "output": "You seem happy with your job. But is something else wrong? You're behaving rather..."}, {"instruction": "Differently? I suppose so. You see, a lot has changed in the time since I spoke to you last.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Such as?"}, {"instruction": "Well, let's start at the beginning, shall we? I suppose you would like to hear about my vacation to England.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I would. How were the sheep?"}, {"instruction": "The sheep were fine, Doctor. They send their regards.", "input": "", "output": "Ah, how nice of them."}, {"instruction": "I thought you might like that. England was a revelation. I don't think I can recall feeling so at peace and so on edge all in a single moment. I was walking in places and seeing things that some of the most important historical figures in history had walked in and had seen. I traveled through Ireland and Scotland, too--just for a couple of days, though. Most of my time was spent in London at my mother's flat. I spent a week chasing dreams I'd had since I was a child--dreams of mythic heroes with whom I always wished I could have traveled. I forgot everything back here and lived in a fantasy world where magic was real, if only for a week. Then I came back and prepared to put it all aside, at least on the surface. Underneath it all, I'm the same silly girl I always was--she just went underground.", "input": "", "output": "Put it all aside? Why?"}, {"instruction": "Doc, I'm twenty-three years old...a college graduate. I'm starting my first job in my chosen field and I'm doing well. I'm a grown up now, like it or not, and I have to act it, if only for the sake of society. No more ghosts in the hallway for me. It's sad the way our society kills the dreams we have or, failing that, kills the dreamer with drugs or despair. But that's the world we live in, and one person can't change the world. All my life, I believed that just one person could and that I was the person to do it. And I tried, Doc, you don't know how hard I tried!", "input": "", "output": "Chris, I don't think I understand. You intend to put aside all of what you consider your childhood in one week?"}, {"instruction": "I already told you, I'm not putting it aside. I'm just hiding it from prying eyes. No one but me and my computer need know about it. Well, maybe you too. Sometimes. When you don't look at me funny like that.", "input": "", "output": "I'm serious."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doc. You want serious? Look at this.", "input": "", "output": "It's a pretty ring."}, {"instruction": "A pretty engagement ring. I wouldn't take it at first, you know. I told him that I didn't want to break up, but I couldn't make that kind of a commitment just yet. I had too much I wanted to do. We had a huge fight, and he accused me of living in a dream world. He said that I was frivolous and narcissistic, that I should get my high and mighty ass down out of the clouds and see the world that was passing me by in a cloud of smog and sweat. He was right, in his own little Malcolm-way. I try too hard to change things and people--Jonny, Dad, even Malcolm himself--rework them over in the image of what I consider perfection.  But life isn't something that can be cleaned up and made presentable all that easily. Especially not by some bossy little snot who thinks just because her nickname is Queen of the World that she can rule everyone's lives by royal decree.", "input": "", "output": "Did Malcolm say that to you?"}, {"instruction": "No, Doctor. I said that to myself. I'm my own worst critic, it would seem.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So when are you going to marry Malcolm?"}, {"instruction": "In December.", "input": "", "output": "Really?  Is this what you want, Christina?"}, {"instruction": "What makes you ask that, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "That look on your face. You look less like someone who's planning to marry the person that she wants to be with for the rest of her life and more like someone who's just been told the date of their execution."}, {"instruction": "Is psychic ability a prerequisite for being a shrink?", "input": "", "output": "You've asked me that before, I think. No. No psychic ability needed. I know you, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Right, so you don't need psychic ability. Am I that transparent?", "input": "", "output": "I'll tell you this: for an average man, I'm willing to bet, you're an extremely difficult person to get to know."}, {"instruction": "I've been told so.", "input": "", "output": "If you don't want to marry him, then why did you accept the ring?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I do and I don't. I like the idea of security. With Malcolm tethering me to reality, I'll be far less likely to go flying off chasing rainbows and being generally goofy...well, maybe not too much less.", "input": "", "output": "I like you the way you are."}, {"instruction": "You're my shrink. You only have to deal with me for one hour out of the week. You can afford to like me when I'm goofy.", "input": "", "output": "Chris, don't you see what I'm saying?"}, {"instruction": "Um, not really, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "All right. If you're going to get married, do it for the right reasons. Do it because you love the person, not to anchor yourself to routine and normalcy which you're mistaking for reality."}, {"instruction": "More than anything else in this world, reality is subjective, Doc. And when someone's version of reality doesn't quite fit with everyone else's--with anyone else's--those are the people that we notice. Our poets, musicians, and madmen all have their own slant on reality. Besides, I do love Malcolm. I don't know that I would call it a grand mad passion, but I love him. I'm not a coward, Doctor. I could be great at anything I want to do, anything at all. I could be a great teacher or an even greater writer. I could even do both. Hell, maybe I will do both, who knows? But I can't go on the way that I am.", "input": "", "output": "I don't understand. What is so wrong with the way that you are? You've come back to my office a stranger, Chris. If you feel you need to make a lifestyle change, then make it. But don't do something that makes you so obviously unhappy."}, {"instruction": "You're saying that I'm making a mistake.", "input": "", "output": "It's considered bad form for a psychiatrist to say something like that, but quite honestly, yes. I think you are. You used to be happy and energetic, full of life. You can hardly look me in the face today."}, {"instruction": "I'm just tired...", "input": "", "output": "No. You're not just tired."}, {"instruction": "No, not just tired, okay? Tired, confused, sad, bewildered, trapped. Trapped, trapped, trapped. More than anything else, that's how I feel right now.", "input": "", "output": "Keep talking."}, {"instruction": "Right, right. It's all pretty strange, really. I started to feel like no one needed me anymore is what it all boils down to. Can you imagine what you would feel like, Doc, if one day it seemed like all your patients were suddenly able to function without your help? You'd be happy for them, sure, but wouldn't you feel kind of alone, kind of useless, too?", "input": "", "output": "So that's what this is all about..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I was gone for just a while and everyone seems to have worked things out. Carmichael's content; he's got a new crop of freshmen to terrorize. He's already poking around, asking the Comp 101 professors about who shows promise in his new batch. Jonny doesn't need me to protect him anymore. He turned eighteen last month. He and Greg seem more in love every day, and Dad is all sort of cool with it. Speaking of Dad, he's squared away, too. He's retiring early, around Thanksgiving probably. His successor is already picked by his own hand, and he has complete confidence in her abilities. He's proposed to Sarah, and she's considering it. He and Joanne are legally separated, and the divorce should be final rather quickly. Bessa is getting her thesis published. She has a new man, and she's probably going to be moving to Chicago. Anders is bustling with activity and completely thrilled with his new gig as an emcee for the fastest growing drag cabaret in the city. The only one who seems to still need me around is Malcolm. I haven't heard from Andrew for awhile. I suppose I'll have to deal with that as the school year progresses. But everything's resolved. All the major conflicts have gone away. Closed book, end of story. What do I do now?", "input": "", "output": "Now, now, slow down. You're an active person, and a natural leader. You're also very protective and nurturing to those around you who need your help. And you're about to embark on a whole new challenge, Chris. You'll be a wonderful teacher and, I'm willing to bet, a good writer, too. You have a lot of room in your life right now, and I think you're looking for something to fill it. But this is not the answer."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I never did deal well with empty spaces. And it seems like that's all I have--one big empty space. I tried to explain that to Malcolm when he handed me the ring. He told me to wear the ring for a week and, every time I look at it, to think how much more empty space there would be without him there. Because if I refused his proposal now, there wouldn't be another one. He got a job offer back in New York that he's going to take. He told them that he'd start in January, but he can start anytime. He wants me to move with him. We'd have the wedding here, then move after the honeymoon--there goes my job here. If I give him the ring back, he's going to leave without me. End of that story, too.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, isn't that cute? Why doesn't he just hit me over the head with a club and drag me off by my hair, I wonder. He even wanted me to quit smoking.", "input": "", "output": "So when is the week up?"}, {"instruction": "Sunday. Pbbbbbt.", "input": "", "output": "Chris?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah?", "input": "", "output": "You sound better already."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doc. One raspberry and I'm cured. This could start a whole new trend--the Rocky and Bullwinkle school of psychiatric treatment.", "input": "", "output": "That's good, mind if I use it sometime?  So what will you do?"}, {"instruction": "Not sure yet. At the very least, I'll reexamine my reasons for slipping my neck into the noose, so to speak. But as I sat here just now and heard the senseless drivel pouring out of my mouth, I realized just how bloody stupid it all sounded. My self-esteem hit the floor when I realized that no one really depended on me anymore. Malcolm insisted that he was the only one that needed me now, and how could I just throw that all away? Blah, blah, blah. But marrying him would be wrong if I didn't do it for my own reasons. And if I listened to that shit, I'd be doing it for all the wrong reasons. There's no real way I can go through with this and continue to look myself in the eye in the mirror--let alone my shrink across the desk--without thinking it through.

So how are you this fine September evening?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm great. You?", "input": "", "output": "Well enough, but apparently not as good as you. You certainly look chipper. I haven't seen you this happy in a while.

Kind of weird, huh?", "input": "", "output": "You gave Malcolm back the ring?"}, {"instruction": "Slowly, slowly. One thing at a time, Doc! It's been a crazy but great week and there's a lot to tell.", "input": "", "output": "All right, all right.

Tell me what happened with your father."}, {"instruction": "Well, remember I told you not long ago that Dad had proposed to Sarah and she was considering it?", "input": "", "output": "I remember."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, Dad came by the school to see me during my planning period on Monday afternoon. He brought me lunch from this little  diner called Gracie's--a place we used to go to almost every Saturday afternoon when I was like six or seven years old. It was our mutual guilty pleasure as Joanne was on another of her health food kicks at the time. Cheeseburgers as big as my head, chocolate malts, and onion rings. I didn't even know that the place was still open until he walked into my classroom with the bag and a big Styrofoam cup, grinning like a fool. I have to admit, I was thrilled. Teacher or no, school lunch is school lunch. It also made me remember how dad and I used to have our special time together on Saturdays--just him and me running around doing errands in jeans and sweatshirts away from Joanne. We always got-on really well when I was a kid--before I grew up and got an attitude, and he got strict with me and tried to keep me from doing anything crazy. So I'm sitting there eating, and Dad's making small talk. But he's still got that goofy-ass smile on his face. So naturally, I asked him what the hell was going on. He said he had to get back to the office, but to come over to the house for dinner on Wednesday night and, as he put it, all would be made known.", "input": "", "output": "Cryptic."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, wasn't it though? Not at all like Mister Herald the Horrible.", "input": "", "output": "So what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I showed up on Wednesday at around six-thirty. Jonny was already there, and from the sounds of things, he is totally convinced that the amount of homework they give in college classes will kill him before the end of the semester. I got a certain demented glee out of that remembering how I felt when I was a freshman. Now someone else is suffering, and I'd graduated. Jonny told me to get stuffed when I laughed at him--made me proud. A year ago, he wouldn't have said that even to me--too timid. Anyway, for once Greg wasn't with him, which lead me to believe that this was going to be some important family pow-wow. Then Gavin came stomping through the door, muttering angry gibberish about having to drive from Santa Cruz and that this had better be important. I was beginning to get really suspicious, and I wondered whether Dad was about to introduce us to yet another unknown sibling. But then he called us all into the dining room. Sarah was there with him. We all sat down to dinner, and the next thing I knew, Dad came back from the kitchen with a bottle of champagne, and told us all that he and Sarah were tying the knot on the second Saturday in 1998.", "input": "", "output": "And what was the general response?"}, {"instruction": "Stupefication, at first. That this could be the reason for our assembly simply hadn't occurred to me. Then, slowly, everyone started to unthaw from the shock, and the squealing, hugging, shouting, and giggling began. It was really cool. Like everything was finally the way it was supposed to be in the first place. I don't necessarily regret Dad marrying Joanne simply because I love my kid brother, and he has nothing of his mother's poisonous personality. But it still felt like everything was all lined-up. Even Jonny was thrilled--he always liked Sarah. And Joanne still won't speak to him since she found out he's gay. Bitch.", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to be part of the wedding?"}, {"instruction": "Yup. I'm going to be Sarah's attendant. Dad's having his brother for best man. And Gavin and Jonny are going to be ushers. But you know what the coolest part is? Dad's best friend from college is a judge and he's going to perform the ceremony. I haven't seen Uncle Joel, as I called him, since I was ten. His kids used to be my best friends. Tim and Tara are twins about a year older than me. They're going to come out for the wedding, too. I don't think I've seen them for at least nine years. When Uncle Joel got divorced, they went to live with their mother in Massachusetts.", "input": "", "output": "This is all really good news."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's going to be great.", "input": "", "output": "I'm happy for your father. From what you've told me, it sounds as though he really loves Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. \"He's finally marrying the right one,\" my mother said. Grandma Strauss doesn't know what to think of my father now, though. He divorced one of her daughters, but now he's marrying the other one. She's confused. But she's coming anyway. And she's going to be staying with me again.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like fun. So let's talk about Malcolm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Well, set your mind at ease. Look here.", "input": "", "output": "No ring."}, {"instruction": "No ring.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "He came over on Tuesday, sat down at my kitchen table, and started to talk. He was telling me how I should behave in front of his mother; and what we would need to buy for the new place before we left for New York; and what of mine would need to be put in storage, since it obviously wasn't good enough for the homestead of a newly married professional couple. And in the middle of this litany, I got this mental image of him at another kitchen table, talking to a five year old kid, outlining the poor little mite's chores and duties until he or she turned twenty-one. So I just blurted out: \"I can't do this. I just can't do this,\" right in the middle of his speech. His jaw dropped. He honestly didn't expect this: \"Didn't I know how good I had it?\" I guess not. He kept asking me why. And all I could do for awhile was shake my head. Besides, he wanted me to give Lancelot away. Give up my cat? Not in a million, baby.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "You should get a cat, Doc. Cats are good company.", "input": "", "output": "I've thought about it. I might one of these days. So what will  Malcolm do now?"}, {"instruction": "He's shipping out to New York--going back to the East Coast where he says things make more sense.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I wondered what your take on that would be. Anyway, we managed to part on cordial terms. He said that he realized, once he calmed down, that we could never have made each other happy in the long term. He blamed himself for a lot of it--what with the way we got started and all. The whole thing was hard, I guess, but not as hard as I thought it would be.", "input": "", "output": "So you're all right with this?"}, {"instruction": "Not to worry, Doc. It would have happened anyway. We never would have made it to the altar.", "input": "", "output": "How do you like the single life thus far?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no complaints. It's actually kind of nice. No one to answer to but myself. The only hitch is that once you get used to sleeping with someone else there, being alone in the bed can be hard. Really hard. It sucks, actually. I haven't been sleeping too well the last couple of nights. But I wouldn't want to have just anyone there, you know what I'm saying? It still sucks, though.", "input": "", "output": "I know exactly what you mean. Well, looks like that's it for tonight, Chris. See you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Of course, of course. Take care, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "You too."}, {"instruction": "Hey, hey, hey.", "input": "", "output": "Hi, Chris. Come on in; I'll be with you in a moment."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "What's that look for?"}, {"instruction": "That monkey on your lamp shade. It's kind of unnerving. I think it's staring at me.", "input": "", "output": "Have a seat, Chris."}, {"instruction": "It doesn't like me, I'm sure of it.", "input": "", "output": "So, it looks like you've been shopping."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I decided I needed to blow a bit of my paycheck on some new stuff. I also had a gift certificate that Bessa gave me to celebrate my newly single status, so I had to use it up. A gift certificate to Victoria's Secret.", "input": "", "output": "How thoughtful."}, {"instruction": "God knows when I'll again have the occasion to use any of this stuff, but it can be fun to shop for. Oh, Victoria's Secret. Or Vicky's Knickers, as Bessa calls it. It was an interesting experience. I thought Anders was perverse; I'd never been underwear shopping with Bessa. You look like shit, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you ever so much."}, {"instruction": "You're also in a snit.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm? I'm fine."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, right. What gives?", "input": "", "output": "There's nothing wrong, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Hmm.  Well, I'm tired, too. Between the two of us, we're really not going to get a lot accomplished this evening--no breaking down any new barriers of the subconscious tonight. The only barriers that might get broken are those of good taste, knowing my mouth.", "input": "", "output": "Then this might be a good opportunity to review some of what you've accomplished since you started coming to my office. Let's see where you are with your panic disorder and..."}, {"instruction": "That might be okay. I think I could handle that. I probably wouldn't have to think too much about it. Free flow of ideas. Dig it, man.", "input": "", "output": "You're being silly. I'm serious."}, {"instruction": "I thought you liked it when I was silly.", "input": "", "output": "Have you had any panic attacks recently?"}, {"instruction": "Define recently. Within the last five minutes or within the last month?", "input": "", "output": "Let's say within the last week or two."}, {"instruction": "Well, when I broke up with Malcolm, I had a panic attack then. That was last Tuesday. I ran into a discipline situation at school yesterday. That kind of set me on edge, and I had a mild freak out. Lucky thing, that it was just before my planning period.  I couldn't have faced a classroom of tenth graders right after that.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, a couple of boys got into something of a scuffle in front of my  classroom door. I had to call for the security officer, but he was busy writing tickets to underclassmen trying to park in the seniors' lot and was slow in getting to the scene. I didn't know what to do. Both those kids were good size; I think one was on  the wrestling team. And here was me--five foot three in my socks, and weighing about half as much as the smaller of the two young lads. I couldn't very well go wading in there and expect anything but to get laughed at best or broken in half at worst. So I chewed on my thumbnail and waited till Officer Bradley decided to hoist his caboose up the stairs to see what all the fuss was about. I felt useless, and I was worried about my students. Several of them knew the boys involved. I made damned sure that everyone  stayed in the classroom until it was over, though. I had to fill out some paperwork and stuff because I was the one who called it in, and the principal said that he couldn't have done any better. But...still.", "input": "", "output": "Is your school considered dangerous?"}, {"instruction": "No. Compared to some of the others I've seen, it's a paradise--an island of serenity. At the school where I did my student teaching, the two kids fighting would have been doing it with switchblades or handguns or other equally charming things designed to open up big bleeding holes in the average person.", "input": "", "output": "Tough job."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I love it. Believe it or not, I honestly enjoy doing what I'm doing.  I've been hooked ever since I presented my science project to the class in sixth grade. I felt like I was important because I got to stand up in front of the class and talk about something that I had just learned a lot about. And this fits in well with my artistic impulses. I can show the students how to communicate their ideas and emotions. And I can devote my entire summers to writing if I want to. For a few years, the writing will be competing with my graduate classes for attention. But the opportunity is there if I care to take it. It's a nice safety valve.", "input": "", "output": "Aren't you taking evening classes this term?"}, {"instruction": "I was going to take several, but I scaled down to one. Not Carmichael's. He was crushed. So I'm only doing graduate school one night a week. I intend to have my M.A. within about three years, though. Four, tops.", "input": "", "output": "The Four Tops?"}, {"instruction": "Leave Motown out of this. You know what I mean, you silly slaphappy Doctor, you.", "input": "", "output": "It's not nice to abuse your psychiatrist."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you're so abused. Poor creature. Anyhow, to get back on track, I had a pretty nice turnaround as far as my problem with the panic is concerned. They occur a lot less often and never without some sort of a reason. And I know now what the trigger is--I don't like feeling out of control. I don't know if I would go so far as to say that I'm a control freak, but I do like to know exactly what's going on at any given time and keep tabs on all that happens around me. And I don't like being  forced. Usually, the harder you try to get me to do something, the more likely I am to say no--just out of sheer bullheadedness. Caffeine only makes the situation worse, so I try to stay away. Every once in awhile, I have to have coffee, but usually now I drink chai.", "input": "", "output": "Chai?"}, {"instruction": "You should try it. It's really something. I think it tastes like gingerbread, kind of. It's a tea served with milk, either iced or hot. Either way, it's  really good.", "input": "", "output": "I'll have to remember that. So you think that feeling out of control is what  brings on your attacks?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing else seems to set me off like that. Did I ever tell you about the  dream I used to have when I was a kid?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think so."}, {"instruction": "From the time I was about five until now, I have had this recurring dream. I dream that I'm in a car on a fairly busy road at night. The car is sedately navigating traffic, all seems well enough. I'm sitting in the backseat, and I realize that there's no one driving the goddamned car. So I spend the rest of the dream trying to fight my way up to the  driver's seat to gain control of the vehicle. But the farthest that I can ever make it is to the front passenger side. Then I wake up.", "input": "", "output": "It certainly sounds as though you've always had some issues with control.  You're a very independent-minded person, and I think you're very conscious about someone trying to infringe upon your freedom. The fact that you began having this dream at five is interesting. Was yours a very controlling household?"}, {"instruction": "With my father? Need you ask, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I see your point."}, {"instruction": "Oh, it wasn't as though he blew a whistle and I was supposed to snap to attention. But dinner was at a certain hour. My bedtime was strictly observed. And my time for homework was set aside as well. As I got older, things were a bit more relaxed, but not much. So I started to get a little crazy, I guess. But I've told you a bit about my adolescence before, I think.", "input": "", "output": "A bit, yes. Do you think therapy has worked for you? Have you noticed any significant changes in your life?"}, {"instruction": "I no longer feel that I have to take on the whole world and all its troubles singlehandedly, if that's what you mean. I still try to mother-hen those in my circle of friends and family, of course. But I'm not the only one in the world that can solve any one given problem. That was egotism. Self-destructive, too. I'm considerably more relaxed and able to keep myself from jumping at every challenge that presents itself to me. And I'll probably still have some stomach lining left by the time I'm fifty.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds good, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Hey, this is pretty amazing. Even tired, we manage to make progress in one form or another.", "input": "", "output": "I'd call it a pretty successful hour."}, {"instruction": "Quite a team, eh? Oh, hey, by the way...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Jonny's boyfriend Greg has a cat named Clementine that had kittens last Friday. You said that you'd thought about getting one, so I thought I'd let you know.  There are three of them--two are black and white, and one is an odd sort of peachy color that may or may not turn out to be orange.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Thanks for the news."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, it will be about seven weeks before they're ready to go anywhere.", "input": "", "output": "You haven't had any new Lancelot stories for me lately."}, {"instruction": "Well, he's still huge. And he just keeps getting bigger. I think he must be part Maine Coon or, failing that, part bobcat. Right now, he's still disgruntled with me for not being home to entertain him during the day anymore.", "input": "", "output": "I see. He'll get over it."}, {"instruction": "I don't suppose you do cat psychotherapy, too.", "input": "", "output": "Unfortunately not."}, {"instruction": "Just thought I'd ask. Good night, Doc.

See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks for the sheep, Chris."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Cookies, I think. But I might have screwed them up.

Take a bite.", "input": "", "output": "What kind are they? They're a bit odd-looking."}, {"instruction": "Oatmeal with crushed hazelnuts and toffee pieces. They may look weird, but they're good, I think. I was bored after school and had about two hours to kill before coming here. It was an invention.", "input": "", "output": "Why test it out on me?"}, {"instruction": "Because I knew you'd be too faultlessly polite to refuse.", "input": "", "output": "Unjust."}, {"instruction": "You bring it on yourself by being so supportive and stuff. Eat.", "input": "", "output": "They're good, actually. Very good."}, {"instruction": "Good. Here. Don't eat them all at once. Did you know that there was a Princess Di sighting already?", "input": "", "output": "No, I hadn't heard that, actually."}, {"instruction": "Bessa was telling me about it. Apparently someone saw her last weekend. I knew this was going to happen. Just for the record, Elvis is dead, too. And the President does not have an extraterrestrial advisor. Where do these people come from? It's insulting that the average intelligence of the typical resident of the Western world appears to be sinking with each publication of a tabloid newspaper.", "input": "", "output": "It is rather disheartening."}, {"instruction": "What? No asking how I feel about that or what had happened that would lead me to that conclusion? No normal shrink-speak?", "input": "", "output": "I know you well enough by now to know when you're just making conversation and when you're leading up to something. You'll talk about whatever's bothering you when you're ready and not before."}, {"instruction": "I knew I liked you for a reason, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "So, is there anything in particular on your mind this week, Chris?"}, {"instruction": "What you mean is, \"Am I going to say anything serious or just sit here and be entertaining for an hour?\" Stop that laughing.

Have you gone to the doctor yet?"}, {"instruction": "Um...", "input": "", "output": "I didn't think so. You should. It sounds like it could be bronchitis."}, {"instruction": "I think it was bronchitis. My fever got up pretty high last week--I was getting chills. I always thought it was weird that when your fever is the highest you get chills and the only way you can stay halfway comfortable is bundled up under a bunch of blankets, which only makes things worse. But I'm fine now. The cough is just a holdover, probably because I was smoking while I had all that chest congestion.", "input": "", "output": "Now, come on. You should know better than that."}, {"instruction": "I'm an addict. Cigarettes are a harder habit to break than heroin, from what I've read.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, well..."}, {"instruction": "Well?", "input": "", "output": "Anyway, you were saying?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. It's been a week of incidents. Small things. But when put together, they just kind of turn into a whole lot of strangeness. For one thing, I was in my classroom during my planning period, and one of my students came in to pick up something she had forgotten. I had my blazer off, and she saw the top part of my tattoo over the back of my shirt. Now, the entire tenth grade knows that the new English teacher is some sort of a punk. I can only hope that the principal doesn't get wind of this.", "input": "", "output": "Lots of professionals your age have tattoos now. It's not a big deal."}, {"instruction": "There you go with that whole \"at your age\" thing again. I'm twenty-three, Doc. And even though I don't always act it, I'm an adult. I talk to big people in big people talk on occasion, and everything.", "input": "", "output": "I know that you're an adult, Chris, believe me. I just meant that it seems to be a trend as of late. Never mind all that. What else happened?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry I got pissy, Doctor. I tend to be defensive about stuff like that, I suppose. I'm relatively short, and I act like a loony sometimes--I tend to worry about how seriously I'm taken.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. I do take you seriously, and I know you're an adult. Believe me?"}, {"instruction": "More than I do most others in this world. Okay, what else? I had to take my cat to the vet, because the silly little shit was jumping for the counter and missed. His back was all tender, and he cried when you tried to touch him or anything. Of course I was in a panic. I thought my poor little Lance was about to die. But the vet said that he'd be okay--probably just some pulled muscles or something. I was standing there with my eyes all red and puffy, coughing like Camille and fretting over the little fur ball, and the vet asked me for my phone number. I kind of blinked and was like, \"Can't you get it from the records?\" He blushed really red and said that what he really meant was that he'd like permission to call me on a more personal level. I was surprised. I did not look my best, nor was I feeling particularly charming or pleasant at that moment. So I was all intrigued and about to say yes, when I catch this little gleam out of the corner of my eye.", "input": "", "output": "A needle?"}, {"instruction": "A wedding ring. I was hit on by a married man! Oh, he tried to stick his hand in his pocket before I noticed and stuff, but still. It's insulting, kind of. Is this what I've been reduced to?", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't worry. You're coming off a fairly long-term relationship that had deep emotional issues with which you had to cope. Maybe you should just take it slow for awhile."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, maybe so.", "input": "", "output": "Is that it?"}, {"instruction": "I had an interesting conversation with grandma the other day.", "input": "", "output": "Your Grandmother Strauss?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. She says that she has a bunch of stuff that she wants to give me that belonged to her younger sister, my great-aunt Helen. Great-aunt Helen died a long time ago--like back in the forties. She was only about twenty years old, certainly no older than twenty-five. Grandma can be a little hard to follow at times because she mixes her languages all up and the only two of them I can understand are English and some German. As near as I could tell, she thinks that my personality is similar to her sister's and that I would like the things that she kept of hers. So she's going to mail them to me this week.", "input": "", "output": "That ought to be interesting."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I can hardly wait to see what's in that package. Grandma implied a lot, but said nothing specifically. I called Sarah and asked her about it, but she couldn't tell me what was in the trunk. And mom didn't even know it existed. Incidentally, mom and Thaddeus postponed the actual wedding yet again. They may not get married at all--they seem perfectly content living in sin, as my mother gleefully puts it. She isn't sure whether or not she wants to come out for dad's and Sarah's wedding. Ms. Lily Alicia Strauss Herald Strauss, with her silly flighty head for once firmly on her shoulders, said that she wondered if her appearance at the marriage of her ex-husband and the father of her child to her older sister would be in poor taste.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "That's mom. I always thought that she should have been named Daisy instead of Lily.", "input": "", "output": "Like in \"The Great Gatsby.\""}, {"instruction": "Exactly! Fitzgerald is something of an American legend. Didn't you just love that book?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I did. Well, we're about out of time, Chris. Thank you for the cookies. My compliments to the chef."}, {"instruction": "No problem. Have a good week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You too. I hope Lancelot feels better."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "Oh, no..."}, {"instruction": "I can see you're about to lose it, but before you do, let me explain. No, I'm not going to hand this animal--this kitten--to you and say \"Happy Trails!\" For one thing, she's too young for that. It'll be at least another three weeks before she's ready to go to a new home. The reason that she is with me today is because, for some ungodly reason, Greg's cat Clementine turned out to be a rather lousy mother and refused to nurse her kittens anymore. So Greg, Jonny, Bessa, and I have each taken a kitten and keep it with us so it can be fed at certain times of the day. Lest you think that I am entertaining this winsome little fluffball in my classroom, I will tell you that during the day Anders plays mama-cat to all four kittens, but in the evening, he demands a break. Besides, he works at night and the rest of us are in one sort of school or another all day long. Little Clio is my responsibility in the evenings until she is weaned. You can start breathing again.", "input": "", "output": "You don't know just how much that terrified me."}, {"instruction": "Doc, you turned absolutely white. If that's not terror, then what is? But I thought you liked cats; you seemed fine with Lancelot.", "input": "", "output": "I do like cats. Honestly. Stop looking at me like I grew horns and a tail. I was just not quite prepared for one to become an instant fixture in my life this evening."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. She just ate, though, so she shouldn't be a bother. After this, I think I can promise no more household pets in your office. I know it's probably not very good manners, or against regulations, or something.", "input": "", "output": "Is that purring?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she has a motor on her like a '48 Triumph. Hard to believe that something so tiny can rumble like that, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "She is cute..."}, {"instruction": "Do you want to hold her?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I don't know..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, come on. You do, I can tell by that look. Here. Be careful with her. She's only about three and a half weeks old. She should start weaning pretty soon though, I think.", "input": "", "output": "What did you call her? Cleo?"}, {"instruction": "Not as in Cleopatra. As in Clio, the muse of...of...damn. The muse of something. It's either history or epic poetry. From Greek mythology.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Um, Doc...?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Aren't you forgetting something?", "input": "", "output": "What? What am I forgetting?"}, {"instruction": "The part where you pick my brains about how my week's been.", "input": "", "output": "Oh! Oh, dear. Sorry. Here..."}, {"instruction": "No, no, you can keep holding her if you want to. She seems more than content. You hold her and I'll talk. Capisce?", "input": "", "output": "All right, tell me about your week."}, {"instruction": "I am on the horns of a dilemma concerning a student of mine.", "input": "", "output": "All right. What's going on?"}, {"instruction": "Well, let me just preface this by saying that teachers are bound by certain confidentiality rules regarding their students, kind of like doctors are regarding their patients.", "input": "", "output": "I respect that."}, {"instruction": "Well, since I can't in good conscience mention names, I am going to call the particular student I am concerned with Jane. Works for you?", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't know the students anyway, but Jane works for me."}, {"instruction": "All right. Jane is in my second hour class, and she's an extremely bright girl. She's one of the stars of the forensics team, active in several organizations on campus, well-liked and well-adjusted. I've become quite fond of her since the school year's started. She wants to be a teacher and has kind of adopted me as her big sister mentor sort of figure. She asks a lot of questions about why I chose what I did as a career, and so on and so forth. The kind of student any teacher would love to have, right?", "input": "", "output": "I would say so."}, {"instruction": "Right. Well, in structuring my classroom philosophies, I made it clear to the students that should they need someone to talk to about any number of things, I was available. It's something that a lot of teachers do. Sometimes it's easier for a student to go to a teacher whom they see every day than to some guidance counselor sitting in an office who they see maybe twice in a semester. So yesterday, Jane comes to me after school's over and asks to talk. We sit down, and she just bursts into tears.", "input": "", "output": "Uh oh..."}, {"instruction": "Uh oh is right. Jane has been dating this guy who's a year ahead of her in school since the beginning of the summer. I don't know too much about him; I teach tenth grade and he was already passed that when I signed on. But I do know that he's a bright kid as well, active in the art and theater departments, generally touted as being brilliant. Jane starts telling me about how their relationship has been on the rocks, and how he just doesn't seem to care or have any time for her anymore. I figured that this was turning into one of those angsty moments that everyone has once in a while; lord knows I've had enough of them. But then she tells me that she thinks she's pregnant.", "input": "", "output": "Mmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, I was kind of stunned for a minute. Not the kind of stunned that you would think--not the scandalized kind of stunned. More along the lines of a \"this was the last thing I expected\" kind of stunned. After I had recovered myself, I asked her how long overdue the monthly bill was. Not in those words, of course, but you get the idea. She said it should have come two weeks ago. Then she started to cry even harder and go on and on about how her father had all these hopes for her: she would probably get a scholarship and be the first one in her family to graduate college, that she had younger brothers and sisters who looked up to her, and all I could think was that this poor kid was obviously in a whole world of trouble here. That stupid little smug, elitist, pretentious prick she's been wasting her time with has quite possibly just ruined her life and probably doesn't give a damn about it, either! I didn't say that, of course. But I was sure as hell thinking it. I would love to get that little asshole in a room with some of my old friends; they would verbally trounce his hide the moment he opened his mouth! Fucking poseur.", "input": "", "output": "What is your dilemma here?"}, {"instruction": "I want to sit down with Jane and seriously go over her options with her. Discuss her possible choices and how they will fit in with her religious beliefs and plans for the future, as well as her own emotions. But I don't know how far is too far, you know? I mean, if it was what she wanted, I would drive her to the fucking clinic if I didn't think it would cause a maelstrom. All I could do was tell her that I understood what a hard situation that this was for her, and to get one of the little home kits that say yea or nay as soon as possible. I also told her that she should tell her parents about the situation, as well as her boyfriend. She said that if she was pregnant, there was no way that she could tell her parents. She comes from a devoutly Catholic family and there would be--pardon the pun--hell to pay. I really just didn't know what to do. I hate feeling helpless! This girl came to me for help and I feel like I'm being hamstrung by a bunch of red tape. In the end, I told her to just get the test, take it, and then come back and talk to me. I probably have until the beginning of next week to thrash out a plan of action.", "input": "", "output": "I see how difficult a situation this could be."}, {"instruction": "They don't really cover this in the classes. At least not specifically. I mean, we are required to report any suspicions of abuse and stuff, sure, but other than that, I really don't know. I'm concerned for my job, of course, but when it comes right down to it, I'm more concerned about my student's well-being. But well-being means a lot of things. She's fifteen for chrissakes! She may make a decision about terminating the pregnancy one day and then change her mind the next, and if the procedure's done, then she's out of luck. And a fifteen year old girl is not the most emotionally stable of creatures to begin with. Add the hormones of pregnancy careening about in her system and it's well-nigh impossible to count on anything.

You certainly managed that quickly."}, {"instruction": "Comes with experience. Well, now you've seen how it unfolds, and how I start to get wound up and have to throttle it down.

Just let me know."}, {"instruction": "Consider it an unexpected bonus, Doctor. Here.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, it's a picture of my kitten..."}, {"instruction": "Aha! So little Clio's your kitten now, is she?", "input": "", "output": "I...well...  Hmm.  I just meant...stop looking so self-satisfied."}, {"instruction": "Sorry. But in an another week or two, she'll be ready to move. The kittens are all taking to solid food easily now.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's good. How have you been, Chris?"}, {"instruction": "Well, do you remember my student Jane Doe I spoke of last time I was here?", "input": "", "output": "Of course."}, {"instruction": "Well, she's officially in a family way. Gynecologist approved and everything. Her family turned out to be far more supportive than either she or I anticipated. The baby's due in the summer, and she's going to give it up for adoption and come back to school in the fall.", "input": "", "output": "A happy ending, then."}, {"instruction": "Not exactly.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Look, I know I was probably pretty harsh in my comments about Jane's boyfriend last week, and I'm sorry. What can I say? He got her pregnant and then wouldn't have much to do with her. So my estrogen put on combat boots and started chanting for blood. But I'm over that now. However, I don't think Miss Jane's older brother is.", "input": "", "output": "Did he threaten your student's boyfriend?"}, {"instruction": "It depends on what you consider threatening. If watching him like he was a bug under a microscope is threatening, then not really. If watching him like he's an ant that her brother is about to ignite with a magnifying glass is threatening, then her brother is probably being threatening.", "input": "", "output": "But has he done anything..."}, {"instruction": "No. But I heard quite a bit about this guy from Mr. Tyler--the Senior English teacher--who said that Jane's brother was always kind of bad news. His exact wording was that Jane's brother was a \"human powder keg.\" Mr. Tyler is convinced--with all his hysterical, paranoid little heart--that Jane's brother is going to do something nasty.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, tell me about it.", "input": "", "output": "Are you in any danger?"}, {"instruction": "Me? Uh uh. I'm pretty safe. He has no reason to be angry with me.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Just be careful, all right?"}, {"instruction": "Of course I will.", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "The silliest thing is that I can't help but feel that it all ended too easily. I mean just a week or two ago, it all seemed so constrictive and so hopeless. There was absolutely nothing I could do. And now, it's just business as usual in the woods.", "input": "", "output": "You were very worried about your student, and your personal make-up requires your active involvement.  I think that you're thinking that it's too simple because of the relief of the anti-climatic, if you understand what I mean."}, {"instruction": "You could be right.", "input": "", "output": "How's your personal life?"}, {"instruction": "Ha ha. What personal life? Oh sure, I go out with my friends. I have drinks with Bessa and Robyn, and I go to see Anders perform. But that's really it. I go to work, pour a whole lot of energy into my students, come home and grade papers, then feed my cat and, on my more conscientious nights, myself. And then I fall into bed. I love what I'm doing, but I guess I really am kind of lonely even though I have a lot of people around me. I kind of miss Malcolm. The relationship would never have worked, but it was secure and cozy--a warm fuzzy noose with which to hang myself--I know that. But I still hate sleeping alone, and I hate not having that support. I don't necessarily have to have a man around, but it's kind of a nice little luxury to put up with.", "input": "", "output": "But do you feel ready for another relationship now? It doesn't sound as though you are."}, {"instruction": "You're absolutely right. No, I'm not. But that doesn't change the fact that my hormones are going on a rampage.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I'm not going to just jump at the first man that comes my way, you know? I'm too damned picky for that. I'm beginning to sound redundant, am I not? I think I have probably already said this about a hundred times before. All of it. But I don't really care. It's not ruling my life or anything.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. You seem to have a firm grip on your priorities."}, {"instruction": "What I have right now is life by the balls, Doc. Everything's going perfectly except for the fact that the perfect man is absent. And if that's all that's missing, then I'm a hell of a lot better off than most. I love my job, my home, my cat, my friends, my family. There's only that one thing missing, and it can bloody well wait. Hey, Bessa decided not to move. Isn't that great?", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that you're happy."}, {"instruction": "Yup, it's going to be nice. She's claimed your kitten's brother as hers--that funky orange colored one in the picture with her. She's calling him Shakespeare. It goes well with some of the other pet names in our group of people. Lancelot, Clementine, Shakespeare, Hector...", "input": "", "output": "Hector?"}, {"instruction": "Didn't I tell you about Hector? This is a lovely story. You'll like this.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Joanne had this little ratty Pomeranian dog named Papillion or something ridiculous like that. Dad hated it. It was yappy, obnoxious, and it peed in unique places, like Dad's two hundred dollar Italian loafers. So when Joanne moved out and took her yappy little dog with her, Dad made his way to the pound and came back with this huge dog that was perhaps as dumb and ugly a creature that I had ever seen. But there was something about that animal. He was only dumb on the surface, and he had personality like you wouldn't believe. Dad named the dog Hector for the boxer Hector something or other. That's what kind of dog it was--a boxer, a big brindle boxer that is reasonably fond of Sarah and utterly worships my father. Hector is the coolest dog in the world.", "input": "", "output": "I think I'm being set up."}, {"instruction": "Hmm?", "input": "", "output": "Don't give me those big innocent eyes, young lady. I know perfectly well what you're up to. You're trying to impress upon me just how wonderful pets are so I'll bring that kitten home with me. You have, for some reason, decided that I need companionship. But I will not be forced into this decision, do you hear?"}, {"instruction": "You referred to her as your kitten earlier, Doc. I think your mind is made up. You're just being stubborn.", "input": "", "output": "May I ask why you have made it your singular mission in life to see to it that I am comfortably settled down with the right animal?"}, {"instruction": "You have that look about you. I recognize it from myself before I got Lancelot--that \"I need companionship\" look. So I thought I'd help it along.  Anyway, I've got to go--papers to grade and all that.", "input": "", "output": "It's still early."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I'll see you next week. Good night, Doctor Balis. Keep the picture, I have others.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Chris."}, {"instruction": "Is there a doctor in the house?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, very funny. Come in and sit down."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. Doc, you look stressed. Is something wrong?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, no. Nothing. Nothing at all. How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "Not too bad. I spent a lot of time with the rest of the tenth grade teachers planning our interdisciplinary unit. It should be interesting, it focuses on the environment and conservation efforts. For my part as an English teacher, I'm having the students read some naturalist stuff, mainly Thoreau's Walden. The other teachers are doing stuff like conservation problems, and the science teachers are leading a field trip. It's a lot of work, but it's going to be fun.", "input": "", "output": "You sound excited about it. It's good to see your work making you so happy."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it doesn't suck. My personal life is picking up a little bit, too.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? How?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, it was kind of a strange situation, actually. For the first time in a long time, I went back to the bar with Bessa and Robyn, and I saw that guy again.", "input": "", "output": "Which guy?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, the guy who used to be a bartender there. His name's Decker, as it turns out. I hadn't seen him the last couple times that I'd been there. In fact, I hadn't seen him in ages. I don't think he remembered me, though--kind of an ego blow. I mean if there's one thing I'm not used to, it's being forgotten. I tried to prod his memory--I mentioned the conversation about my cat and the double bock--but it didn't seem to help.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, once we got past the fact that he didn't remember me, things went well enough. I probably would have tucked my tail between my legs and scurried back to my table, but I had baseball on the brain and by chance mentioned the World Series. He seemed to perk right up, the conversation went better after that. It turned out he'd been hanging out in Chicago on vacation for the last month or so.", "input": "", "output": "Ah. What did he do in Chicago?"}, {"instruction": "Normal vacation things. He said there were a lot of good restaurants, but the traffic was even worse than here, and the people weren't very friendly. He mentioned passing Wrigley Field, but then he said that he'd never actually been to a baseball game.", "input": "", "output": "Sacrilege."}, {"instruction": "Don't be sarcastic. I thought it was kind of weird. Between Oakland and the Giants, most people here get to a game at some point in their lives. And stadium hot dogs are not to be missed. I waxed rhapsodic about the hot dogs for a few minutes, and he just laughed. A really quiet guy, he just kind of stood back and let me rattle on. Then I told him about this exhibit I'd heard about--some stuff from the Baseball Hall of Fame that they're taking on tour--and it's coming to the Bay Area this weekend. Before I really knew what was happening, we'd agreed to meet up at the museum on Saturday. I don't know if I'd really call it a date or what, but it should be fun.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you have a good time."}, {"instruction": "I think I will. He looks a little different than I remembered--he used to have kind of long hair, and now he's got his head shaved. I hope he doesn't turn out to be some sort of a neo-Nazi or something. My hair's a lot shorter now, too. I wonder if that's why he didn't recognize me.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I wouldn't fret too much over it. If he didn't remember your conversation before, he'll probably remember you now."}, {"instruction": "Yup, you betcha. Oh hey, I finally got that trunk of my great aunt's stuff from my grandmother.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, really? Is it all you'd hoped?"}, {"instruction": "It's wonderful! You wouldn't believe some of the stuff that's in there. There's this really great pair of open-toed red shoes with that little forties-style platform and the sling backs, and they fit me perfectly. I'd never dream of ruining them by wearing them out somewhere, but I've walked around the living room in them, much to Lancelot's amusement. That cat has a really strange sense of humor. I blame it on my brother. But let's see, what else? Photographs, lots of them--one of my great-aunt and her uncle Karl, and several of her and this absolutely foxy guy with big dark eyes you could die for. If that's my great-uncle, then I can't blame my great-aunt for jumping on him.", "input": "", "output": "Chris, you're incorrigible."}, {"instruction": "Yes, it's part of my charm. What else? Oh yeah, this locket was in there. There's no pictures in it, but there's a lock of hair. I'd open it, but I don't want it to fall out and get lost.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. That's really lovely."}, {"instruction": "I know. I haven't really cleaned it yet, but I think there's an inscription. I'll have to get some tarnish remover and see. But besides this, there's a length of net that grandma says was part of her wedding veil, but she never got to wear it. I asked why not, and grandma just kind of clammed up and changed the subject. I think there's a story there. Maybe all those notebooks will tell me.", "input": "", "output": "Notebooks?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, notebooks. A whole bunch of them, in one form or another. Some are those really fancy blank journal books, and some are regular composition books, and some are just scraps of paper shoved in between the covers of notebooks. But there are a hell of a lot of them. Grandma said that she did her best to put them in chronological order. I haven't started reading yet, but I intend to tonight.", "input": "", "output": "This could become a very interesting project. It's always fascinating to delve into one's family history."}, {"instruction": "I know. It's all so beautiful. There's lots of little stuff in the trunk, too. Some postcards, programs from a symphony performance, what looks like a wedding invitation, some silk lingerie--it's like a treasure chest! The arrival of the trunk was better than any Christmas morning that I can remember. I hope I can keep my cat from trying to eat something.", "input": "", "output": "Ingesting mothballs could be bad for him."}, {"instruction": "You're right, of course. But it's selfish, too. I don't want any of this stuff getting destroyed, even though my mother would love it. She'd just consider it proof that grandma never should have sent this stuff to me instead of her and that I had no right to have it. I mean, come on. It was grandma's to do what she wanted to with it, and she said that she thought I'd love and cherish the things that were in the trunk and what it all meant more than anyone. Sarah agreed. But Mom had a fit, saying that by rights it was hers and I didn't have a clue about what this meant to anyone in our family--yeah, give. Like she's been a part of the family. She trotted off to England to marry Thaddeus. God, sometimes she just amazes me. She's completely immature and selfish. Totally Daisy.", "input": "", "output": "I remember the Great Gatsby comparison from a while ago..."}, {"instruction": "It's still more than apt.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you're enjoying the gift from your grandmother. You'll have to tell me more about it as you discover what's in the journals."}, {"instruction": "Oh, you can bet on it. I'll be too excited to keep it to myself. God, this trunk really made my week, along with meeting this guy on Saturday and the interdisciplinary unit going so well. I'm on the move again. Life's fun. Now if only Drew would stop giving me the morose look every time he walked past me in the building...", "input": "", "output": "Who...oh, yes, the man who's getting a divorce."}, {"instruction": "The divorce is still being drawn out. I'm tired of it. If I hear any more, I'm going to throw up. So I try to be cool to him, and he gets all maudlin and holes up in his room all day long.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Drew'll get over it all. Hey, it's only about another week or so, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Until what?"}, {"instruction": "You know, the cat.", "input": "", "output": "Oh...oh, yes. The cat."}, {"instruction": "Any thoughts?", "input": "", "output": "I'll let you know. I'm still kicking it around. No, I won't be kicking the kitten, don't give me that look of mock-horror."}, {"instruction": "Oh, speaking of which...", "input": "", "output": "Uh oh. What are you pulling out of there?"}, {"instruction": "Ta dah! Happy Halloween!", "input": "", "output": "Cupcakes? Thank you, they're cute."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and that plastic spider thing sitting on top is really a ring. You could maybe fit it on your little finger or something? Anyway, that's your problem now. I have to go; I must go shopping for a Halloween costume tonight. Anders is taking me to a party. But before that, I get to see his new cabaret for the first time! Thrill!", "input": "", "output": "Happy Halloween, Chris. Have fun."}, {"instruction": "Hey Doc...listen I may have to cut things short tonight. Jonny and Greg are interviewing a prospective parent for one of their kittens, and they want me there for some outrageous reason; they trust my judgment of character or something.", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead and sit, Chris, you know the drill. I'll be done clearing this up in just a second. I'm glad you mentioned the kittens, because I've been meaning to talk to you about that. I think that I would like that kitten after all, the one you brought with you that night. If she's not already spoken for."}, {"instruction": "No, no, she's available. I was sort of hoping you'd decide to take her, so I kept her reserved, more or less. I can bring her with me next week, or if you'd prefer I can bring her by earlier.", "input": "", "output": "Next week should be fine. It will give me time to pick up the requisite supplies and kitten-proof my apartment."}, {"instruction": "Sure. I can give you the phone number of my new veterinarian, as well. He's great. Looks like Santa Claus--big white beard, red suspenders, the whole nine yards. Lancelot adores him.", "input": "", "output": "Right. Now, I'm not going to be able to keep her in the office. Will she be okay in the apartment all day by herself?"}, {"instruction": "Should be. Give her toys, things to scratch on, make up for it with extra affection on evenings and weekends. You know what I used to do for Lancelot?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Turn on the TV. Specifically, the cartoon channel. Don't ask me why, but it worked. He was still relatively contented by the time I'd get home. The voices from the TV kept him company. I know it sounds like the worst sort of parent who uses TV as a babysitter, but I still had furniture by the time he was grown enough not to scratch on everything.", "input": "", "output": "I'll remember that. I'm going to have to start making a list. Is there any sort of toy that's better than others?"}, {"instruction": "Anything with catnip is usually a good bet. Things that roll and make noise are good too, little things like balls with bells in them, you know? Lancelot likes those huge furry looking quasi-rodent things. He uses them for attack practice. But the thing I absolutely swear by is actually a battery-powered children's toy. It's a green ball, about the size of a softball, with a long fluffy tail attached. Turn it on, and it flops and rolls around on its own. Really great stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Right, right. What about food?"}, {"instruction": "Food. Okay. I feed Lancelot this special food, recommended by vets and stuff. It's more healthy then regular dry cat food, less waste, more gets absorbed into kitty's system. Soft food is okay for a special treat, but I don't feed it to him regularly. I'll tell you something though. Pet stores sell these little tablets for cat treats, made from brewer's yeast. Cats go nuts over them, it's the most amazing thing I've ever seen. I don't think I've seen a cat yet that didn't love them. Those little dried fishy things stink, and Lance always just chewed the head off and left the rest. Am I getting too disgusting for you, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "No, not at all. Brewer's yeast, hmm. Clever. You can stop looking so self-satisfied, young lady."}, {"instruction": "Can't help it, old man.", "input": "", "output": "Hey, I'm not that old."}, {"instruction": "And I'm not all that young.", "input": "", "output": "Touch\u00e9. Will you be terribly offended if I change the cat's name?"}, {"instruction": "Not at all. What were you going to call her?", "input": "", "output": "I was thinking of calling her...you're going to laugh."}, {"instruction": "No, I won't. I promise. What?", "input": "", "output": "Portia. I was going to call her Portia."}, {"instruction": "I see...", "input": "", "output": "It fits with the trend. And I happen to like the Merchant of Venice very much."}, {"instruction": "Uh huh.  Hmm...it's cute.", "input": "", "output": "You want to laugh."}, {"instruction": "I do not!", "input": "", "output": "You do. You're dying to laugh in fact."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to laugh. I like it, actually. I wish I'd thought of it.", "input": "", "output": "You do?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I do. And even if I didn't, she's your cat. Capisce?", "input": "", "output": "You're right, of course. I spend enough time saying similar things to you, after all."}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "That it's what you think that's important and not what I think."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. I vaguely remember that from somewhere back in the mists of time.", "input": "", "output": "That irony suits your character. So, putting pet talk aside, how was your week?"}, {"instruction": "Not bad at all. Want to hear about my time at the museum?", "input": "", "output": "Ah, the baseball exhibit."}, {"instruction": "You remember. Good. Well, I had a fantastic time.", "input": "", "output": "I would have liked to have gone myself, actually. How was it?"}, {"instruction": "Amazing! You wouldn't believe some of the stuff they had there. And Decker, the guy I went with, is like a total baseball encyclopedia. He knew something, I think, about every item in this traveling collection. Statistics, trivia, history, you name it. I was really getting into it, strutting around in my little A's ball cap, practically dragging the poor man from exhibit to exhibit like a five year old. In retrospect I think I would have been embarrassed if he hadn't seemed to have been enjoying it as much as I was. He was sweet, too. We wound up holding hands through the last half of the exhibit. I don't know if it'll be a relationship--it's too early to tell--but I know I had a great time. We went for beers afterwards, still no double bock, but it wasn't too bad anyway, and talked some more. This time we actually traded numbers and such, and I'll probably make plans with him again this weekend. And no, he's not a skin head. The shaved head is just a look.", "input": "", "output": "It certainly sounds like you had a good time. Do you think he might be relationship material?"}, {"instruction": "Doc, I barely know the guy yet. I like what I see so far is all I know for sure, and I really would like to see him again. Beyond that, who can say? He's good looking, fun to be around, and sweet in a sort of shy way. Seems really normal, too. And after Kevin and Malcolm, normal is good. Very very good.", "input": "", "output": "I would just hate to see you rush into anything."}, {"instruction": "I'm not going to rush, Doc...don't worry about me. I'm tough, remember? Grrr...", "input": "", "output": "Stop flexing at me. I get your point. You don't do a terribly good bodybuilder imitation."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I'm prettier than just about any of them.", "input": "", "output": "I certainly can't argue the point. Anything else going on?"}, {"instruction": "Not too much. A couple of things. Some sad news. Jane Doe, my student who was pregnant, had a miscarriage Sunday night. I feel bad for her, she came back to school yesterday and just looked exhausted and miserable.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, dear...how awful."}, {"instruction": "Uh huh. What do you say, besides that you'll be there if she needs to talk, and that you're sympathetic?", "input": "", "output": "That's about all you can say."}, {"instruction": "I know. Still. Hey, I started reading the journals in the trunk. The things start in like 1938 and run all the way through '52. So I'm going to be busy for awhile. The really bad part is that they were all out of order. So I had to spend an evening reorganizing them. Thrill and a half. The trunk is magic, it's better than having a time machine. I walk around in those strappy red forties platform pumps and pick through the notebooks and all sorts of silly stuff. Great stress reliever, especially on the days when I can't cope with reality.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Are the journals interesting?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah, really interesting. it's just so touching, really. My great-aunt lived with her uncle after her parents died, and he was a University professor. Really just little day to day stuff for now, but it's still lovely. What the...damn, I hate pagers.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what that was? It sounded like some sort of weapon from a science fiction movie."}, {"instruction": "Yeah I know. Oh, look. Jonny's number. I guess it's my cue to go, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "All right, you take care, Chris. Don't forget my cat next week."}, {"instruction": "Wouldn't dream of it. Just get all her stuff and I'll bring her to you. Have fun.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks a lot."}, {"instruction": "That's okay. Tough session, was it?", "input": "", "output": "It's okay. Oh, is this my kitten?"}, {"instruction": "Yup, you can go ahead and borrow my cat carrier to get her home and stuff like that. I'll just pick it up next week. There you go, come on out, Miss Kitty.", "input": "", "output": "She's gotten bigger."}, {"instruction": "There's a cute little quote I read somewhere: \"The trouble with a kitten is that eventually it becomes a cat.\"", "input": "", "output": "Thank you for bringing her. Now, I don't want to spend the whole hour talking about cat care again; I picked up a couple of books on the subject and should be able to do well enough. I know you called and said that you wanted to skip this session, but I have to ask, is something troubling you, Chris?"}, {"instruction": "What makes you say that?", "input": "", "output": "You have that look to you. You usually have very expressive eyes, and right now they are rather--pardon the expression--dull. It's the \"Chris hasn't slept in days\" look."}, {"instruction": "Well, I slept...sort of. I closed my eyes for periods of time.", "input": "", "output": "You want to tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "I'd love to, but I can't. Not now. I'm afraid I have to roll out. I really just came to drop your new friend by and wish you good luck. There's a surprise retirement party for Dad being planned, and I've been recruited for the planning. Sarah's working her tail off on this thing; it promises to be quite the event. But she needs a break, and she trusts me to see that nothing goes south while she's getting a little work done.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure you want to skip a session?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I really can't stay, but thanks. I'll live till next week.", "input": "", "output": "Next week is Thanksgiving.  I'll be out of town.  So it will have to be two weeks."}, {"instruction": "That's okay. I promise that if I start having a nervous breakdown, I'll let you know. In the meantime, I really have to get rolling. Don't worry, okay? I'll be fine. It's really not too big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Thank you for loaning me the kitty carrier."}, {"instruction": "No problem. Goodbye, Portia. You take care of him, okay?", "input": "", "output": "I will. Take care of yourself, Chris. And thank you."}, {"instruction": "Have a good Thanksgiving, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks, you too."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, last time I checked, anyway. What's up, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Without big feet and rabbit ears, that voice just doesn't come across as it should."}, {"instruction": "Everyone's a critic. Miss me?", "input": "", "output": "Always. Is everything going well? You looked awfully tired the last time you were in here."}, {"instruction": "I was. Between helping plan Dad's retirement party--which got postponed--and preparing finals for my students, and the fact that I managed to get hooked into this volunteer program--we help people get their equivalency diplomas--my life is getting active again. It's nice, but I had gotten used to a more low-keyed pace. It's taking awhile to get back into the swing of things again.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you're enjoying it, but just remember not to take on too much. You've managed to control your panic disorder admirably in the time you've been coming here, and I would hate to see you start slipping back into that again because your life got to be too hectic."}, {"instruction": "\"Slipping back into?\" You make it sound as though I'm on drugs or something.", "input": "", "output": "Don't laugh, I'm serious."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry, I'm not going to start drowning my sorrows in the coffee house again. I'm a nice, sedate, little tea-drinking old maid schoolteacher now.", "input": "", "output": "I hardly think you're an old maid..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, a hundred years ago, I would have been up in some attic writing poetry that didn't rhyme and having a deeply emotional relationship with my cat. The only thing separating me from that right now is that I don't live in an attic.", "input": "", "output": "I thought you were dating a promising man."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. Well, I haven't heard from him in a few days. He called at the beginning of the week, and I was kind of frazzled. I had Sarah screaming in my ear that the party store was out of silver streamers and what in God's name were we going to do. And Jonny was wailing on my shoulder because he and Greg had their first real fight--happy Thanksgiving to all! About the only one really happy right now is Dad. He doesn't have to go in the office anymore, he thinks his successor at SII is worthy. He can sit and puff on his pipe and plan his wedding. Bear in mind that what Dad considers planning his wedding involves staring reflectively out the window and daydreaming about how wonderful it will be. He's acting like Prince Charming rather than Herald the Horrible. It's like something out of an episode of the Twilight Zone.", "input": "", "output": "He's happy."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.

How's the cat?", "input": "", "output": "Fine, fine. She's decided that she likes to sleep practically on my head, but she's fine. It's working out well. The veterinarian is great, by the way."}, {"instruction": "What did I tell you? He looks like Santa Claus.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you're right. He...you're getting me off the subject."}, {"instruction": "Sorry--stream of consciousness conversation. There really isn't a lot more to say. I'm up to my old tricks again, so to speak, and I'm getting stressed over stupid shit. I need to calm down and try and relax. I can handle it all.", "input": "", "output": "You're not back on caffeine, are you?"}, {"instruction": "No, Doc. I told you earlier I'm not. I promise. Thou shall not bullshit thy therapist, remember? It's one of the commandments, I think. I never paid attention in Sunday school. When Joanne went on her religious kick, I was too busy trying to kiss the minister's son. He went to jail when he was nineteen--possession of cocaine or something.

Gavin was an idiot and got his pretty little vegan coed from UCSC pregnant. She wants to name the kid Apricot Nectar or something weird like that. I think she's eaten a bit too much carob. Just being around her makes me want to go pick up a steak and grill it nice and rare before eating it with my bare hands. Rebellion has its advantages.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...well, I have to move. I'm picking up artichokes for some weird whore's ovary that Sarah has planned for the party. \"Hire a caterer\" is what I say.

It's just hard for a girl to change after so long, you know? I would wash my hands of the whole project, but Sarah needs me. I have Christmas break to relax. I'll be fine.
