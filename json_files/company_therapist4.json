Do you know who I am?", "input": "", "output": "I gather you work in accounting at SII."}, {"instruction": "I'm the Accounts Manager. Mostly I manage the pension fund, working directly under Frank Herald. Do you know him?", "input": "", "output": "No, I don't think so. Should I?"}, {"instruction": "He's the Chief Financial Officer. I believe you're treating his daughter, Christina.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you know that I can't discuss my patients."}, {"instruction": "Then she is a patient.", "input": "", "output": "I can't even tell you that. Is that what you came here to discuss?"}, {"instruction": "Would it make it easier if I said that Frank told me his daughter is seeing you?", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Lippard, as a psychiatrist, I am not at liberty to discuss any of my patients, even with their family. I just don't speak about my patients at all."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Good.", "input": "", "output": "That was a test?"}, {"instruction": "I hope you'll treat me the same way.", "input": "", "output": "Of course. All of our conversations will be held in the strictest confidence."}, {"instruction": "And there's nothing that will cause you to break that confidence?", "input": "", "output": "Well, absent a patient's consent, there are only a few times I can think of.  There are certain cases where my professional responsibilities would override the doctor-patient privilege. For instance, if the patient was likely to cause imminent harm to himself or others.  And sometimes a psychiatrist can be compelled to testify by court order."}, {"instruction": "Have you ever had to do that?", "input": "", "output": "Not yet.  I hope that situation never comes up. Are you concerned about this?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really. I'm no danger to anyone, particularly myself. It's just, for professional reasons, I don't want SII to know I was here.", "input": "", "output": "I do, of course, have to bill your medical insurance, but I believe the individual names and services of each employee are kept confidential by the HMO.  I assure you that SII won't hear about your treatment from me."}, {"instruction": "That will be satisfactory.  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Are you ready to tell me why you're here?"}, {"instruction": "It's a little embarrassing, really. A silly thing happened to me last week, and it's been on my mind.", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "Well, last Wednesday...I should start by saying that I usually have lunch in the same place every day. I go to a sushi bar next to the Embarcadero--Kansai. Do you know it?", "input": "", "output": "I've passed by."}, {"instruction": "Well, I sit at the same stool at the bar, near the end, and the chef knows my name.  The waitress always brings me green tea without asking, it's very nice--comfortable, you know? And I eat and brainstorm, and I run a tab. It's part of my routine. Is that strange?", "input": "", "output": "Having a routine? Not at all. Please go on."}, {"instruction": "I'm getting there. Last Wednesday, when I got to the restaurant, there was someone in my seat. So I asked him to move, and he wouldn't. So I explained that this was my regular seat, and he said, \"Look lady, I'm here now. What's the difference? Go find another place.\" And the chef, of course, he wouldn't intervene. He's a businessman. He tried to settle it diplomatically and said \"Please, Ms. Lippard, there's a very nice place over here, away from the rest.\"", "input": "", "output": "Did you take the seat?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I took it, clear at the other end of the bar. Logically, it was just as good a seat: isolated, good view of the door, quiet. But logic didn't enter into it. I was mad, damn it! I was mad at that man I never met for taking my seat, and I was mad at Kenny for not standing up for me.", "input": "", "output": "Kenny?"}, {"instruction": "The chef.", "input": "", "output": "But you just explained that he couldn't intervene because of business."}, {"instruction": "Yes, of course, but somehow that didn't stop me from being angry with him.", "input": "", "output": "So how was your lunch?"}, {"instruction": "Fine, I suppose. It's always good there. But I really don't remember. I couldn't get any work done, I couldn't enjoy the meal, I just ate and got out. But it bothered me the whole rest of the day--had me all off kilter. I couldn't even go there the next day, I was afraid that man would be back. I worked through lunch, ate nothing. But I got almost nothing done all day.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been back since?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I went back Friday. Everything was back to normal. Kenny had missed me, and made me something special. But this one little thing had me all out of whack for two whole days.", "input": "", "output": "That does seem excessive."}, {"instruction": "That's what I thought. So that's why I'm here. It seems like not getting the right stool at the bar wouldn't be such a big thing, to screw me up for two entire days. I figure something is really wrong with me to be affected that way, and I had heard from Frank about you, so I thought I'd see what you could make of it.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "You see what? What do you make of it? Am I losing my mind? I mean, I just have one drink a night, I don't act recklessly, I don't hear voices. This is the most I've lost my cool, the most I've raised my voice, in I don't know how long. So what's going on?", "input": "", "output": "I think we'll need a little more information before we can find that out. What do you think it was about this man that affected you so strongly? Was it his manner? Did he remind you of someone?"}, {"instruction": "He was in my seat!", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I understand, stay calm."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry. I don't know why this is so aggravating. I apologize.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right. So it wasn't about the man, it was about the seat."}, {"instruction": "No, it was about my routine. He blew my routine, and I couldn't recover for two days.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you have many of these routines?"}, {"instruction": "A few, I guess. I mean, I brush my teeth the same way every time, I take the same route to work, I watch the same newscast. Do those count?", "input": "", "output": "Well, most people get into routines like that. It helps to stabilize our lives, and lends some predictability. What if one of your routines is interrupted--say road construction forces you to take a detour on the way to work. Does that upset you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, sure, any delay is annoying. But I think I'd recover. What bothers me about this is that it affected me so strongly, for so long. That doesn't seem right.", "input": "", "output": "If it's a problem for you, then we can deal with it here. We're almost out of time, but this deserves more work. Can we meet again next week?"}, {"instruction": "Let me check my calendar. Yes, the same time next week works out.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I'll see you then."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Goodbye, Dr. Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Ms. Lippard."}, {"instruction": "Good afternoon, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good afternoon, Ms. Lippard. How are you today?"}, {"instruction": "Busy. Mondays are always rough. What do you have for me?", "input": "", "output": "I beg your pardon?"}, {"instruction": "You've had a week to consider my case. Do you have any insights? Do I have some mental disorder or did I just go overboard about nothing?", "input": "", "output": "Well, you certainly responded strongly to a stimulus that others might find trivial.  But that may or may not be part of something significant. If you're looking for a diagnosis, it's too early for me make one, or even to know if one applies. I'll need some more information first."}, {"instruction": "Okay, ask away.", "input": "", "output": "You spoke of having a number of routines.  Do they extend into your work? Do you have certain ways of getting things done, certain processes that you have to follow to complete a task?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure I'm following you. There are things at work that need to be done, and I do them. My criteria for picking investments doesn't change much; the things that make one stock sound make any stock sound. So I do the research the same way each time. I worked hard to get the accounting department functioning according to my systems, but now it works smoothly. Everyone knows their responsibilities, and they handle them. Oh, you should have seen that department when I started! Things got done, but organizationally, it was a wreck. Everyone had their own methods, their own filing systems. I worked my ass off for...oh, excuse me, I worked overtime for months to...", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, you can speak plainly here."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. I'm afraid I'm picking up some of Phil's habits. We've been spending a lot of time together.", "input": "", "output": "Phil?"}, {"instruction": "That's, uh...never mind. Philip's not important to this right now. I'm afraid I got a little carried away. Did I answer your question?", "input": "", "output": "Mostly. It sounds like you're more concerned that things get done efficiently than that they get done in a certain way."}, {"instruction": "Yes...but, not really. I mean, if there is an efficient way, I want it done that way. And if the whole staff does it the same way, there's minimal waste. But if someone can show me a better way, we'll all start doing it that way. I'm not a power hungry tyrant; it doesn't have to be the way I came up with, it just has to be the best way.", "input": "", "output": "And this applies to you too, not just your staff?"}, {"instruction": "Certainly.", "input": "", "output": "And what about accuracy? If it gets done correctly, is it very important exactly how it got done?"}, {"instruction": "I don't expect anything less than the right answer from my staff, every time. The standard is perfection. That may sound a bit harsh, but you have to realize that we're dealing with a billion dollar company here. Little errors can make a big mess in a big hurry. But if you do it by the systems that are in place every time, the answer will come up right, every time. Oh, wow, you just heard part of my interview. I give that little speech to potential accountants during their job interviews. It's weeded out more than one.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it sounds straightforward and honest to give fair warning about what standard you expect in your employees. Those are good qualities in a manager. What about your personal life? Same attitudes?"}, {"instruction": "Well...I'm not entirely the same person at home as at work. I like to loosen up a bit at home. As for the way things are done, I'm not as concerned with finding the best way; I just find a way I'm comfortable with and stick to it. As for perfection, I'm still pretty demanding...of myself, I mean. I can expect my employees to perform to my expectations, but not my friends.", "input": "", "output": "So you're not concerned with efficiency in your personal life?"}, {"instruction": "Um...not usually. Sometimes. But often I'll keep doing things a certain way even though I know there's a better way, just because that's the way I do it. It makes me feel good that way. For instance, when I plan the menu and the shopping list, I do it all on the computer. I know I could just jot it down on paper in half the time. But no, I have to have two documents open side by side, and move from one to the other as things occur to me, then get them formatted and printed nice and neat. I know the checkout girls think I'm nuts, with a computer printed shopping list with little check marks by each item. But it makes me feel better, somehow, to have everything in order.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Are there many things you're so...detail oriented with?"}, {"instruction": "A few. I'm a very neat and organized person. Is there such a thing as pathological organization?", "input": "", "output": "That depends on how much the organization interferes with what you're trying to accomplish. Are there times when you get so wrapped up in the process that the task itself never gets completed?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. It's funny you should mention that. That's something I've been working on. Or rather, something I've had to work on. I had that problem for a while in school--you know, I'd spend so much time getting ready to study, making sure the environment was just right, making sure I had all the materials and so forth, that I'd use up half of my study time. I tried to deduct that time from my social life but I spent so little time on having a social life that it didn't help much. So I had to break myself of that, of all the preparations and stuff, I mean. But I guess I did it all right. Can't waste much time and graduate Summa Cum Laude from Harvard.", "input": "", "output": "Summa Cum Laude, and from Harvard. That's very impressive."}, {"instruction": "That's why I went. And it worked; Frank Herald was all aglow about my MBA from Harvard when I interviewed. But truth be told, I cheated. I transferred to Harvard just for the last part of my MBA. Did most of my MBA at the University of South Carolina, where I'm from. God, if Frank knew that, he never would have hired me! He can be such a snob.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have any rituals that you have to do?  Anything that must be a certain number, like counting, or washing your hands a certain number of times, or something?  Any superstitions that are really quite strong?"}, {"instruction": "Not really.  I can't think of anything like that.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it sounds like you have a pretty good handle on things. Not everyone could have recognized that the need for everything to be just so when studying was actually interfering with the studying itself.  And then you seemed to have worked to solve it quite effectively."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. I like to think I have my life in order.", "input": "", "output": "It would seem that you do. In fact, given what you've told me, I don't know that I could be of much benefit to you."}, {"instruction": "I don't follow.", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Lippard, aside from being very organized, and that one incident in the sushi bar, you haven't told me anything that unusual. We could meet and talk, but I don't think I would be much help.  You haven't shared with me any areas in your life in which I could render any particular assistance.  And since you asked me whether the incident in the sushi bar was indicative of some mental disability, I can assure you that, without more, it is not.  There are always some things, trivial to others perhaps, that can throw someone for a loop.  Your need for organization and your concern about detail doesn't seem to have affected your ability to function at quite a high level.  You seem to be quite level-headed, you seem to know yourself well.  You don't seem to be exhibiting any particular anxiety or distress.  Your physical health, from what I can see, seems fine. You're a busy woman, and I don't want to waste your time. So, unless there is something else, I don't see any need to continue therapy."}, {"instruction": "[Silence]", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Lippard?"}, {"instruction": "So you're saying I'm fine?", "input": "", "output": "I'm saying at this point I don't see any particular benefit to long-term therapy."}, {"instruction": "Well...good! So I just overreacted that one time? You don't think I'm in danger of having my routines take over my life?", "input": "", "output": "What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I think I have things pretty well under control.", "input": "", "output": "Fine. Then we'll call it a day. Feel free to call me, of course, if you decide that there's something else you'd like to talk about."}, {"instruction": "I'll do that. Thank you, Doctor. It's good to have a clean bill of health.", "input": "", "output": "You're quite welcome. Have a good evening."}, {"instruction": "Hi. Um...I don't know where to begin. I'm kind of embarrassed.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that? Because you called me after hours? I assure you that's not a problem; that's why I have the service."}, {"instruction": "Well, thanks, but it's more than that. Like I've been holding back. I mean, I know you're a therapist, and anything I say stops here. And I know this won't work unless I open up and tell you what's really going on. But that's really hard to do. It's like...it goes against my nature. I've spent so much time being the consummate professional--calm, strong, organized. It's like that's all there is now. I'm a grown woman, damn it. I own a home. I manage a staff. I should be able to say what's on my mind! But no, I come in here, ready to talk, prepared to just spill my guts...and then I can't. I keep playing the cool professional--got it all together, wasting my time and yours. Hell, I played it so well, I even fooled you, who's trained to see through that crap! Even fooled myself. Almost.", "input": "", "output": "But not entirely."}, {"instruction": "No, not entirely. I was stunned when you cut me off last week. First I was happy to know I was basically okay, but then I was cursing myself because I'm not okay and I couldn't say it. And I had blown my chance with you.", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't..."}, {"instruction": "No, no, I know that. You said I could call if I needed to, I know that. I knew it then. But I wasn't dealing with facts and logic at that point. That's another thing that embarrasses me; reason didn't enter into it. Despite the truth, I got all worked up. I...oh, this isn't coming out right.", "input": "", "output": "Go on. I think you're doing fine."}, {"instruction": "Okay, let's see. So I'm embarrassed that I kept playing the professional in here where that's not necessary. I'm embarrassed that I couldn't do what I came here to do. And I'm embarrassed that I lost my cool, that I was drinking and smoking and feeling sorry for myself. And that I called your office drunk and pissed.", "input": "", "output": "That's..."}, {"instruction": "So I'm embarrassed that I kept my cool, and I'm ashamed that I lost it. Isn't that something? I can't win either way.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds..."}, {"instruction": "You know something? I was fully prepared to duck you forever. I was ready to keep making excuses, tell you I was okay, go back into my professional mode, and resign myself to misery and loneliness for the rest of my life. God, what a loser.", "input": "", "output": "So what changed your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Phil. It's always Phil. That boy loves me so much, it's just amazing. He was with me Thursday, egging me on to call you. And then he came to the office Monday, to make sure I called back like I promised. Came to my office! In the three years we've lived here, Philip's never come to my office. He...uh, how did he put it? He \"disdains the corporate culture.\" But he came Monday, not to force me to do something I didn't want to, but to make sure I did what I knew was right. I swear, that boy would walk through fire just to get me out of a parking ticket.", "input": "", "output": "That..."}, {"instruction": "I guess the tables have really turned, haven't they? Now he's taking care of me. You want to hear Phil's take on all of this?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "He says the organizing, the cleaning, the hoarding, the lists--all that...he says it's not about those things. \"Control,\" he says. I'm a control freak. And you know what? He may be right. I'm okay as long as things go as planned. My plan. It's when things change--something happens that I didn't predict--that I lose it. And then I get mad that I lost my cool! Because then I'm not in control of the situation, but more importantly, of myself. What do you think of that? Make sense?", "input": "", "output": "It would seem to fit with what you've told me so far."}, {"instruction": "So there it is. At last. After two weeks, two packs of cigarettes, two phone calls, two hours and...damn...thirty minutes of therapy?  Finally, I got something out that we can work with. Wow. I feel kind of...relieved. It's like, that's a success in itself.", "input": "", "output": "It is a success. The first few steps are usually the hardest. You should be proud."}, {"instruction": "Hey, cool. You mean this is progress?", "input": "", "output": "Absolutely."}, {"instruction": "So what now?", "input": "", "output": "Now the real work starts. You've established that control, particularly self-control, is a major issue for you. If we can find out why, how this developed such importance in your mind, we can work to relieve that. But you should be prepared to find out that control may not be the central issue."}, {"instruction": "You mean the way the orderliness is not the real problem, but control is? Are you saying control is not the real problem, either?", "input": "", "output": "Demanding control and insisting on self-control isn't necessarily a crippling problem by itself.  There are lots of people who use it as a positive tool in their lives.  The problem arises when issues of control cause unhappiness to a person and to the people around her."}, {"instruction": "I'm very unhappy, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Then we should work on these issues."}, {"instruction": "How deep does this go?", "input": "", "output": "That's something we'll have to find out in time. And it will take time. Just as it took time and effort for you to get to this point, the process of therapy happens in fits and starts. Is this important enough to you to make that effort?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Yes it is. I can do this. Hell, I made myself the successful woman I am today, and that wasn't easy; certainly I can do the same thing with my personal life.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good attitude.  There is an element to therapy that is almost like work.  You have a strong work ethic."}, {"instruction": "So, I know we've just gotten started, but what's my prognosis?", "input": "", "output": "I'd say pretty good. You're insightful and open, you're able to figure out what's on your mind and then express it, and you obviously have the intelligence to be able to assimilate the insights that you gain here into the rest of your life."}, {"instruction": "What about medication?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think medication would be appropriate in your case. If you are having difficulty sleeping or if you exhibit some other symptoms, that may change, but right now I think that we'll do better with some relaxation and refocusing techniques that I can show you."}, {"instruction": "Okay, no meds. What about a time frame? How long should this take?", "input": "", "output": "It's impossible to say.  It's only our third session.  You can always let me know if you feel that it isn't working for you. Ms. Lippard, may I point out that you're acting like the consummate professional again? You're turning therapy into a project with schedules and deadlines. Did you notice yourself change?"}, {"instruction": "Oh my, I guess I did. Sorry. I guess I need some practice.", "input": "", "output": "It will take some practice. You've been in that role for a long time. And there's a place where it's appropriate, of course. I just want you to know I'll call you on it if it seems necessary."}, {"instruction": "Of course. That's your job, right?", "input": "", "output": "Exactly. Well, I think you've made a wonderful first step today. Can I count on seeing you at this same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Frank's got me working on this cockeyed scheme for Major, and my responsibilities seem to be changing at work, and...what? What's that look for? Oh, man, that's not the way to do this, is it? Okay, yes! I'll see you next Wednesday at four. And you may as well block out the same time for me every week. I'll work something out at the office. Like Phil says, \"Fuck work, this is more fun!\"", "input": "", "output": "Very good. I'm proud of you. See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Good afternoon, Ms. Lippard. How have you been?"}, {"instruction": "God, busy. Frank has me...but I'm not here to talk about work, am I?", "input": "", "output": "You can talk about anything you want. If work is a concern, there's no reason we can't discuss it."}, {"instruction": "Well...there have been changes, and it's making me nervous.", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "I'm afraid my role is changing at work, and I'm not sure if it's for the better. Major, that's Lloyd Major the CEO, has decided to try for a takeover of Apple. I think I mentioned that. Now that's a much bigger company than this one.  Of course we don't have the capital to pay for it, so we're looking at a leveraged buy-out. Frank's job is to figure out the right combination of loans and bonds and so forth to both insure the takeover happens and that the resulting company can still function financially. That's the background. Ah...before I go on, I want to check something with you. Or rather, point something out. Am I doing the \"professional?\"", "input": "", "output": "A little.  But it was in context."}, {"instruction": "I spotted it! It's almost like I can feel the switch. Aren't you proud of me?", "input": "", "output": "Yes indeed. That shows great self-awareness."}, {"instruction": "Okay, cool. Here's where I come in, so I'll try to turn off the professional. Frank has delegated a lot of this work to me. I don't mean he's getting me to do the research, make the calculations, and brainstorm tax strategies--that would be my usual role as his assistant. What's happening is that he's...well, basically, he's made me his partner. We're working on this together.  He's treating me as an equal, letting me--no, encouraging me--to come up with my own ideas and flesh them out, make calls to the investment bankers and financial institutions--the whole thing. It makes me nervous.", "input": "", "output": "Why's that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's something I haven't done before, and I'm clumsy about it. But Frank is holding my hand and being real patient, helping me along. It's more like I'm an apprentice than a partner. At first, I wondered if the project wasn't impossible and he was looking for someone to share the blame when it all went to hell.  But the way he's helping me out, I don't think that's likely. But what's really bothering me is that I don't know what's going on. Things are changing and I'm not keeping up with them. And this isn't totally new.  Over the past few weeks, Frank's been showing me his filing system, introducing me to contacts. Last week, we even had lunch together and discussed the financial future of SII. Discussed--with Frank asking for my input and not just telling me his vision--so I would be prepared. It's got me all off balance.", "input": "", "output": "That's understandable. This sounds like a major change from your regular routine. How are you reacting to it?"}, {"instruction": "Not too badly, actually. Not like the sushi bar incident. God, that was really extreme! Now, I'm back down to my usual smoking routine, not puffing around the house like I sometimes do.", "input": "", "output": "Your usual smoking routine?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. One with the six o'clock news, one with the eleven.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Go on."}, {"instruction": "At work it's been so busy, so intense, that I haven't had time to really worry about it. You know...it seems like when there's a lot to do at work, I handle the little annoyances so much better, even at home. It's when work is boring, routine, that I get all worked-up about things. Isn't that odd? When things are really haywire, I can handle it.  But when they're not, I...I feel more like they are, more than when they really are. Did that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "Do you mean that the busier you are, the better you handle life's little stresses?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "And when your mind is relatively unoccupied, you tend to dwell on the little things, blowing them out of proportion."}, {"instruction": "Exactly! So that happens a lot?", "input": "", "output": "It's fairly common. I believe there are two things going on. First, the mind works better under stress, to some extent.  The higher the stress, the more efficient are the thought processes.  That's true up to a breaking point, where functionality drops rather precipitously. That's why projects don't get done until the deadline--the pressure heightens the abilities. The second thing, which I think is more significant in your case, is distraction. When you have a lot on your mind, you don't have time left to dwell on little things, so you just let them go. Have you noticed any particular event in the last week or so that would ordinarily cause you anxiety, but that you've managed to just brush off?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I think I was a little more tolerant of things not going my way--lines at the supermarket and such--but I thought that was just your influence.", "input": "", "output": "Not likely. We haven't been working together long enough. Although, the simple fact that you're pursuing therapy may relieve your anxiety somewhat. But let's get back to the office. What is it about your new role that's disturbing to you?"}, {"instruction": "That's it exactly--it's a new role. Frank's taken me out of what I'm used to and is making me do things I'm not prepared for. It's a big change and I don't know why he's doing it.", "input": "", "output": "But wasn't it a big change when you took this job? I assume you haven't been with SII for your whole career."}, {"instruction": "No, I haven't. You don't know much about my career, do you? I moved here from North Carolina to take this job. I was an investment banker. Yeah, it was a big change, but it was my doing. Do you see the difference? I knew what I was getting into. I made the calls. I decided to move. That was my idea, and I negotiated it. This is different.", "input": "", "output": "When you moved, you were in control of the situation.  But these changes are being thrust upon you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, there it is again, isn't it? Control. Shouldn't we be working on that, instead of wasting time with what's going on at work?", "input": "", "output": "Well, in one sense, we are working on the control issues.  Part of my job is to help you develop insight into the psychodynamics that influence you.  Part of the role of therapy is to help you function better in the present, while developing a core set of beliefs and attitudes that will allow you to function better in the long run. If the control issues are critical right now, we can work on that directly. But what we do here together is not wasted even if all we seem to be doing is discussing your problems at work."}, {"instruction": "Hum...I'm not sure I follow. Remember, I have a degree in business, not liberal arts.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I'll rephrase. The more comfortable and happy you are in your present circumstances, the easier it is for us to work on really difficult issues that cause you problems both in your private life and at work. So it's okay to talk about what's going on now, before we get into the deeper stuff."}, {"instruction": "Ah. Okay. So where were we?", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned that the changes you're experiencing now are more distressing to you than the ones you went through when you moved here, because then you held the reins and now you're being led."}, {"instruction": "I like the way you put that--very poetic. Yeah, I'd like to be more...or, rather, less anxious about this. I mean, it's not like I can't handle it. I've coped with bigger changes.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good attitude. You've worked yourself up the corporate ladder to the position you're in now, and you seem to be good at it.  It's obvious that you have the abilities and the business sense. You haven't been afraid to tackle new challenges before, and at the heart of it, this is just another new challenge."}, {"instruction": "Okay, yeah. It's just that I didn't take this on of my own accord.", "input": "", "output": "But it sounds like you're handling it pretty well so far. You've talked about your anxiety and insecurity, but I haven't heard about any problem behaviors. You've even settled down from last week."}, {"instruction": "I'm healed!", "input": "", "output": "Now..."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know, I was kidding. But it's still pretty uncomfortable, even if I'm dealing with it right now.", "input": "", "output": "That may not be such a bad thing. You can learn to use that. Properly channeled, that energy can be used to help you through this."}, {"instruction": "Like the stress that improves performance you were talking about.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, like that."}, {"instruction": "So I can use my stress to work harder.", "input": "", "output": "In a way. Just don't end up putting more pressure on yourself and making it worse."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Gee, we didn't get much done today, did we?", "input": "", "output": "On the contrary, I think you got a great deal accomplished. You identified a problem area, talked it through, and came up with a coping strategy. You recognized the corporate persona and consciously did not allow it to take over the session. And you stayed open and aware of yourself through the whole session. I think that's tremendous progress after only a few sessions."}, {"instruction": "Well, it was you who came up with the coping strategy. But I guess I'm doing okay. I just wanted to get serious about figuring out where my anxieties are coming from, and we didn't even get started.", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Lippard, I have to caution you about getting too eager. If you push too hard, you run the risk of becoming frustrated. You're doing great work here; just be patient and stick with it. The rest will come."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'll try to keep that in mind. Same time next week?", "input": "", "output": "I'll be here."}, {"instruction": "I'm looking forward to it. Until then, then.", "input": "", "output": "Good afternoon, Ms. Lippard."}, {"instruction": "Afternoon, Dr. Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Ms. Lippard. How are you today?"}, {"instruction": "Scared. Haggard. See this?", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I bought it Monday. I've never carried a briefcase before. Even at the bank, when I was making investment decisions minute by minute, I never took work home. I mean, not a bit. I don't even get Business Week and The Wall Street Journal at home; they're delivered to the office, and I leave them there. Now I'm taking home spreadsheets; I'm writing proposals late into the night. I'm losing sleep.", "input": "", "output": "What's changed?"}, {"instruction": "The Apple project has become a real bear. I can see it all going to hell and taking me with it. I'm spending all day meeting with bankers and investors, and all night crunching numbers and thinking up strategies, and I'm still not getting anywhere.", "input": "", "output": "What's the problem?"}, {"instruction": "It just won't fly. I can't get the capital together to make a successful bid. What should really happen is that Apple should buy us, not the other way around. If we buy them, the resulting company will be carrying so much liability that we won't see the light of day for the next decade. Unless we can sport the spectacular growth of a young Wal-Mart--and both companies are just too old and too big for that kind of expansion--nothing I can think of can both create a strong, profitable company and allow the bid to succeed. It's driving me nuts. Frank's at his wits end, too, but it doesn't seem to bother him. That's the real problem, I think. I'm tearing my hair out trying to make the crazy scheme work, and Frank, who's really ultimately responsible for it, is not stressing at all. I think my career is on the line here.", "input": "", "output": "Yours? I'd think if anyone's job was in danger it would be Frank's. But certainly no one's going to get fired if you decide the project simply can't be done."}, {"instruction": "I don't know if that's true. Major can be one of those \"if you can't do it, I'll find someone who can\" kind of managers. So I'm under a lot of pressure to make this work, but if we try and it doesn't work, then my head will be the first to roll.", "input": "", "output": "Why yours? You're not the Chief Financial Officer; you just work for him."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well...this has pretty much become my project. Oh, by the way, I wanted to mention this to you: sometimes I still get stressed out that this has all been pushed on me, you know? I agonize about not being in control--that the change is not my doing. But then I think of what you said, about using the stress to improve my performance, and about how I've handled bigger changes before. And I calm down! If I focus on meeting the challenge, instead of where the challenge is coming from, then I can do it.", "input": "", "output": "That's very good. You're learning to rechannel stressful energy and to avoid dwelling on issues you can't change."}, {"instruction": "Progress, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, excellent progress for the short time you've been in therapy. But I have to caution you again, there may be setbacks, too. Integrating these attitudes is a matter of practice, and you're not going to be able to get it right every time right away."}, {"instruction": "Damn it, Doctor! Every time I make some kind of progress you have to shoot me down by telling me not to be excited about it. It's like you're holding me back. I wonder if you're not trying to stretch this out as long as possible.", "input": "", "output": "Whoa! Settle down. I think the insights you've made are remarkable; I'm proud of the progress you've shown, and I've said so. I just don't want to you to become frustrated if one day you aren't able to put these insights into practice as well as you have before. Therapy is an irregular process. You won't progress at this rapid pace all the time; there may be periods of time when very little seems to be happening. Sometimes you may even feel like you're losing ground. I'm not belittling the progress you've made; far from it. I think it's wonderful. I'm just trying to keep your expectations reasonable."}, {"instruction": "Uh huh.", "input": "", "output": "As for lengthening the therapy process, that's clearly an unethical practice and I simply don't do that."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Well, okay. But can you accept that I understand all that now and not bring it up again? I want to feel good about the progress I make without wondering when it might slow down.", "input": "", "output": "Accepted. I apologize if it seemed like I was harping on the subject."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "You were talking about your job being on the line."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I said this has become my project. Frank has been very helpful, giving me ideas and helping me make contacts and stuff, but he's managed to really distance himself from this. He's been out of the office a lot since this came up; I don't think he's spent five full days at work in the past two weeks. So I'm taking calls on things he's had in the fire that I know nothing about. I can't even give the number crunching to the accountants, because I've already given them almost all of my regular stuff. That's why I'm taking work home now. And Major called me for an update this morning. Called me directly--didn't even want to talk to Frank. Which was good because Frank sauntered in just in time to go to lunch. Apparently, he's made it clear to Major that I'm in charge of this project. I think he wants a scapegoat. What if he knew from the beginning that this deal's impossible, and he's setting me up to take the fall, protecting himself. Damn! I thought he had more integrity than that.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you're making a lot of assumptions. Have you spoken to Frank about this?"}, {"instruction": "What am I going to do, accuse him of setting me up?", "input": "", "output": "Of course not. But you could express these concerns to him, tell him you feel left out to dry, and ask for some more support. You might find out that he has tremendous confidence in your abilities, and feels comfortable putting his career in your hands."}, {"instruction": "Or I might find out that I'm a sacrificial lamb. Of course...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "If that's the case, I could start looking for another job right away. Get the jump on him. Take control back.", "input": "", "output": "That is a possibility. But perhaps you should find out where you really stand before you start planning to quit."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess I should. Sometimes I look so far into the future, I can't see the present.", "input": "", "output": "Well put. Sounds like another new insight."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. With all the warnings about not being disappointed still in mind. Oh hell, I can't believe I didn't mention this!", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "The board meeting. Frank says that since I've done most of the work, I should present the financial plan to the board next Monday. Not this Monday, the next: June 2nd. So I'm going to present this financial fucking disaster to the fucking Board of Directors, including Lloyd Major who's so hot for this takeover, he's creaming his jeans--and the CFO won't even fucking be there! He's taking a long weekend, going to see...I don't remember.", "input": "", "output": "Wow."}, {"instruction": "Damn right, wow. Does it sound a little more like I'm on my own here?", "input": "", "output": "Yes it does. All the more reason to talk to Frank, let him know how alone you feel in this. And find out how alone you really are."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah, I'll have to do that. Tomorrow. Thanks. You know, this is really helping. I mean, the way I'm refocusing and keeping perspective on what's really important. And I never would have confronted Frank about my feelings if I hadn't talked to you. I'm glad I'm doing this. Thanks for helping.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to. That's why I chose this profession. It looks like we're about out of time. Until next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'll be here. I'm skipping workouts, but I'm not skipping this. You know what really gets me? Now the professional is coming home with me, too. It's not like I ever had an active social life, but at least home was separate from work. I'm not relaxing at home, and like I said, I'm missing workouts. But mostly, I miss my time with Phil and his world. I'd almost be okay losing my job. At least then I could have some of my life back.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like an excellent place to start next week."}, {"instruction": "Okay. See you.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Ms. Lippard."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Sorry I'm late. It took longer at the printers than I thought.", "input": "", "output": "Are you late?"}, {"instruction": "I am by my watch.", "input": "", "output": "It's not that important. I don't see your briefcase today. How's the project going?"}, {"instruction": "It's done. I dropped off the materials for the presentation at the printers, and they should be ready Friday, but the project is done.", "input": "", "output": "You seem more relaxed."}, {"instruction": "I am. I had another conversation with you Monday...or was it Friday? Whatever. I was getting really discouraged that I couldn't make the numbers work, so I imagined talking to you about it. I really admire your reason and perspective.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? What did I say?"}, {"instruction": "You reminded me that the numbers are what they are.  That I'd done everything I could with what I had to work with. You said that even though I'd done all the work, it wasn't really my responsibility. You pointed out the possibility that if the board wasn't happy with my work, they might actually blame Frank for putting an underling in charge of such an important project.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good point. If Frank really is trying to distance himself from this, it could backfire on him."}, {"instruction": "You also reminded me that I said I wouldn't really mind losing this job.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, we were going to talk more about that."}, {"instruction": "I'll get to that, but there was something else. I talked to Frank about leaving me alone with this.", "input": "", "output": "How did that go?"}, {"instruction": "Not too bad, actually. I told him how I felt left out in the cold with work I had never done before.  And he apologized for not giving me the support I needed. He said he would have, if I had asked. I have to admit, I pretty much suffered in silence. It's not like me to ask for help--I've got to do it all myself. Frank started to talk about how hectic the week had been for him.  Apparently, there was some kind of family trouble at his son's graduation. Or his daughter's. You know, by the picture on his desk, I thought he had two kids, but he mentioned three names. I didn't understand much of it.  It isn't like Frank to talk about his home life much.  As soon as he realized what he was doing, he clammed up. Something must really be bugging him.", "input": "", "output": "So that's why he's been absent so much?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so. But the upshot of the whole thing was that he thought I was ready to handle this. He said he was confident in me.  He knew it was a tough job, but he thought I was up to it. So we went over everything in depth, and he said he was impressed. Frank doesn't pass out a lot of compliments, but he seemed really sincere. So that made me feel good. I told him since he was the CFO that his ass was really the one on the line here, and he assured me that no asses were on the line.  He thinks if we present the financial picture as honestly as possible--not sugar coat it at all--then it'll all be on Major. And the board won't let us hang.  They've heard Major's shit before, and Frank thinks they're ready to hold him accountable. Just him. So I feel pretty good.  I'm covered and Frank's covered, as long as we present an honest account.", "input": "", "output": "So you don't think you were being set up as a scapegoat?"}, {"instruction": "No, not any more. I think Frank was just distracted, and he really thinks I did a good job. You know, I'm glad to find this out. I was going to lose a lot of respect for Frank, if he was setting me up--it's not his style. He takes responsibility. In fact, instead of my losing respect for him, I think he gained some for me. I feel even more secure in my position now.", "input": "", "output": "Good. So that stress is relieved."}, {"instruction": "Almost. There's still the board meeting, but we're going to rehearse Saturday.  And Frank's decided to be there, so we can present a united front.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you'll do fine."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I think so, too.", "input": "", "output": "So your job is safe."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. But I still might quit.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. You know, I don't get it. Here I am a successful business woman.  I've got an MBA.  I'm the right hand to the Chief Financial Officer of a Fortune 1000 company.  I have a great condo overlooking the Bay in one of the finest cities in the United States. I'm about to trade my fairly new Lexus for a brand new Jaguar. I could live pretty well on half my income, and I'm a hell of an investor--I could retire in ten years and not change my standard of living a bit. The only thing I don't have is a family, and I don't really want that--most of the men who are in my league I find boring. So I have all the things I'm supposed to have.  By all measures, I'm a success. But what good does it do me? I have everything I've ever strived for.  I've achieved all my goals. But I'm...empty. Is this all there is?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Every measure of success that you've used is career-related. You've talked about the job, and retiring, and the things you've bought. What about your personal life? I remember you saying something about relaxing at home and keeping your work out of your personal life."}, {"instruction": "Maybe I exaggerated. I really don't have much personal life. Except for Phil, of course.", "input": "", "output": "You've never really told me who Phil is."}, {"instruction": "Hmm, I guess not. Okay. Philip--that's with one\"l\"--Andrew Lippard is my brother. Daddy called him PAL until Phil got old enough to tell him he didn't like it. He's three years younger than me, a college dropout, and an artist. He moved here from Charleston three years ago, and I promptly followed. Phil can barely take care of himself. He wouldn't have made it here at all, if I hadn't helped him out. Sometimes I still pay his rent, though he hates that. But he knows I don't care about the money, and I've never held it against him. He loves me like mad. I feel the same way, I guess. There's nothing we wouldn't do for each other. I used to take care of him when we were kids--walk him home from the bus, help him with his homework--he always had trouble with school--watch him till Mom came home. Now he worries about me.  And I think that's cute. He listens when I'm feeling bad, tries to get me to go out sometimes. It was Phil who got me to come here in the first place, and then to call you back when you kicked me out. God, he acted like an asshole then! That may be the only time we've ever really screamed at each other. I think he was willing to let me hate him for the rest of my life, if that's what it took to get me into therapy.", "input": "", "output": "That's a big risk for him to take. He must love you very much."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah, wow. And you know what? It's just me. He doesn't even like the work I do, or the professional world I do it in. All that doesn't matter to him.  It's me he loves, not what I do. How did he get to be so wise? When did he become the smarter one?", "input": "", "output": "That would be an interesting thing to talk about."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it would. You know what else would be interesting? How is it that he's so damned happy? Here I am with everything I ever wanted, and I'm miserable.  Empty.  And here he is living on his art, starving half the time, plugging the holes in his walls with newspaper--you know, on bad days it actually gets foggy inside his loft?--and yet he's living it up! I've seen him actually lose weight when he can't sell a painting.  But even then, he's still smiling and carefree. As long as we're talking about things, let's talk about that.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like a good idea. But I don't think we have enough time left to get into it right now. Shall we call it a day?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, that makes sense. So we'll start next week with rich and miserable versus poor and ecstatic.", "input": "", "output": "Good. And good luck with the presentation."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. And thanks for being there for me, even when you're just in my head. This has become very important to me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad I can help. But you're really doing all the work."}, {"instruction": "You're a special man, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Ms. Lippard. Good night."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Are you feeling better?", "input": "", "output": "Good afternoon, Ms. Lippard. Much better, thank you. You certainly look radiant today."}, {"instruction": "You like it? I don't know what got into me. Suddenly, I felt like being nice to myself, so I went shopping. I'm not one of those women who shop for sport.  Normally, I know what I want, go find it, and get out. But yesterday, I just felt whimsical, so I went to Saks Fifth Avenue and there this was, right up front! Total impulse.  It's not like me to just up and buy the first thing that catches my eye.  And this really is colorful for me. The sales girl said it brings out the green in my eyes. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "Now that you mention it, yes. I do see more green in your eyes."}, {"instruction": "I'm so glad. I've always thought there was green there, but most people just see a kind of grayish-brown. I'm made up of \"just-barelys\"--I just barely have an acceptable figure; there's just barely some red in my hair and just barely some green in my eyes. I can just barely relate to other women.  And I can just barely carry on a relationship with a man...for a little while.", "input": "", "output": "But there are things you excel at."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, I'm a pretty good business woman. I can balance the books and make a little money into a lot just by thinking and planning. But that's not enough anymore. We talked about this last time.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you expressed a lack of satisfaction with the tangible results of your career."}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure satisfaction is exactly right. I think fulfillment would be more what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "You feel that achieving your position of wealth and status should have made you fulfilled?"}, {"instruction": "Exactly. Well, not this position; the next one: CFO. Which now looks like mine for the taking.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I guess I should fill you in. The board meeting went well, better than I expected, actually. Frank and I rehearsed on Saturday before.  We spent all day on it and I felt pretty good about it. So as soon as I got through the initial nervousness, I made a great presentation. Of course Major didn't like it--it painted a pretty grim picture. I know that as a stockholder, I'd have to vote against it. So he attacked on several fronts, just like Frank said he would. Frank is pretty savvy.  He anticipated many things that Major would say, right down to the wording. So we had answers ready for him, but he's very convincing, very...charismatic. You know, I wonder...", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Major was so incredibly animated. He couldn't sit still. He talked really fast. And he was sniffling the whole time. I've never seen anyone on cocaine, except on TV. What does it look like?", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure that's relevant right now, Ms. Lippard? Why don't we concentrate on what's going on with you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, okay. So I held my own against Major, with Frank stepping in only once or twice. I think I looked pretty good to the board. In fact, I know I looked good to at least one of them--Walter Montgomery asked me out afterward.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds interesting. Are you going?"}, {"instruction": "No...jeez! He's not even divorced yet, just separated a few months. Besides, he's just another money and power chasing businessman. I've been out with his type before. He'll take me to a swank restaurant where the waiters have phony accents, make a big deal out of selecting the wine, then try to impress me with who he knows and how much he makes. Then, I'm supposed to swoon.  And pretty soon, we'll have a weekend in the Wine Country and I'll be his latest prize. Only the truth will be that I'll be bored with him, because money and status is all he is.  There's no substance.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "That didn't sound good. What do you mean, uh huh?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I was just thinking how well that goes with what you just finished saying about how your own money and status don't satisfy you any more."}, {"instruction": "It does, doesn't it? Oh status! I haven't told you the best part. Last Tuesday, Frank took me out to lunch, and I finally found out the real reason he made me responsible for this whole project.", "input": "", "output": "And that is?"}, {"instruction": "He's grooming me for his position. He plans to retire soon, probably by Thanksgiving or Christmas, and he wants me to take over as CFO. He said this project and presentation were the perfect way to prove I could do it. Plus, it gave him more time to spend with his family, which he says he's been neglecting basically all his life in favor of his career.", "input": "", "output": "And how do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I kind of resent being fooled like that. I wish he had told me this when he gave me the assignment.  That would have made things easier for me. But I guess if it didn't work out, he never would have told me so I wouldn't have been disappointed. Or maybe he would have decided not to retire after all.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell him about your resentment?"}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't think it would do any good. Besides, the end justified the means. If I couldn't handle the job, I'd rather not have known that I blew my chance to take over.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. How do you feel about your impending promotion?"}, {"instruction": "Pretty good, I guess. I mean, it's what I've been working for my whole life. Top of the heap, right? Board meetings, setting my own hours, lots of money, my name on the letterhead. I've never wanted to own a company, or even run one. I like being the one who can make things work. And business is about finance--the Chief Financial Officer is the one who makes it work.", "input": "", "output": "So come Thanksgiving, you'll have hit the top and achieved all you set out to do."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and at only 32 years of age. Pretty impressive, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Very impressive. And what comes after that?"}, {"instruction": "God, you're so perceptive! You can always get right to the heart of the matter. You have substance, Doctor Balis. I need to meet a man like you. You're intelligent and educated--those are prerequisites--but you're also thoughtful, caring, and perceptive. You can talk about more than just spreadsheets and next quarter's earnings.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Ms. Lippard. I'm not sure that I could talk at all about spreadsheets and next quarter's earnings, though.  It does sound to me like you're interested in meeting people outside of your own professional circle. San Francisco is an excellent place to meet a wide variety of people. I get the feeling you've...Ms. Lippard?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm?", "input": "", "output": "Are you still here?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm sorry. Daydreaming. What was the question?", "input": "", "output": "I was just saying that San Francisco is a good city in which to meet a variety of people. I find it to be an eclectic and exciting culture."}, {"instruction": "Really? I haven't seen much of that.", "input": "", "output": "What have you seen? What do you do with your free time?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I work out a lot. And I keep pretty busy around the house.", "input": "", "output": "Is that all? Housework, exercise, and the office? Do you go out at all?"}, {"instruction": "I'm a patron of the symphony.  I see a play once in a while. Plus, I go to all of Philip's shows. I've even bought some of his stuff.", "input": "", "output": "You're describing a very limited social life, Ms. Lippard. Do you have any friends outside of work and your brother?"}, {"instruction": "Huh! I don't have any friends inside of work! I don't think it's appropriate to fraternize with subordinates. And my peers, as I've said, are boring to me.", "input": "", "output": "Let's think about this. You won't or don't want to associate with people at work.  You don't associate with people outside of work. You have very little extracurricular activities, and those that you do have are fairly solitary. What does this say to you?"}, {"instruction": "That I need to get a life?", "input": "", "output": "Not exactly how I'd have put it, but essentially correct. I suspect that a large part of the emptiness you feel is because you're only experiencing half of life. You're very successful in business--\"top of the heap,\" as you put it. But you're not satisfied with that alone. It's not enough for you anymore."}, {"instruction": "True.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe you can find some satisfaction in your personal life. This, in fact, is where most people find it. The majority of the working world just works to bring home a paycheck. Then they raise a family, go to parties, take vacations. They socialize, they have hobbies, and that brings them fulfillment. You're missing out on all of that."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. That could be. What should I do?", "input": "", "output": "Get out more. Meet people."}, {"instruction": "Who?", "input": "", "output": "People who share common interests. Clubs are very good for bringing like-minded people together. Do you go to parties and receptions for patrons of the symphony?"}, {"instruction": "No. I thought it'd just be a bunch of stuffed shirts.", "input": "", "output": "You might be surprised. But if you don't like it, you can always leave, find something else to do."}, {"instruction": "That's true. You know, Phil's always trying to get me to go to gallery openings and poetry slams and stuff with him. Maybe I should.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds good. But try to mingle, don't just stay with Phil. Experience the culture. The art world has some pretty interesting people."}, {"instruction": "It has some real flakes, too.", "input": "", "output": "Certainly. But that's part of the adventure."}, {"instruction": "Adventure, yeah. I'll have an adventure. You know, I'm going to call Phil tonight. I'm going to have a life, Doctor Balis!", "input": "", "output": "Good for you. I'll be eager to hear about it next week. Just be careful."}, {"instruction": "Careful is my middle name.  You should be urging me to take chances, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Well...okay. See you next week, Ms. Katherine Careful Lippard."}, {"instruction": "Hi!", "input": "", "output": "Hello. That's a new look for you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's my new corporate image: Streetnick. Like it?", "input": "", "output": "You went to work like that?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really. Truth is I took the day off. I was out late last night so I just told the office I wouldn't be in today.", "input": "", "output": "Is that okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I've been out all day on business before, and so has Frank. It's not that unusual. Besides, I've got that office running like a well-tuned Jaguar. If there's no meetings scheduled or anything like that, they can pretty well do it without me for a day or two. And I can log on from home for the news and quotes and such. It's good to be the boss...or, for the time being, the vice-boss. Must be nice running your own business like you do, too.", "input": "", "output": "It can be, but it has it's headaches. You were out late last night?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, went to a poetry slam! With a name like \"slam,\" I expected some kind of party or at least something with energy--shouting or something. But this was just a coffee house with a microphone.  People would just get up and read their stuff. I was most impressed with the ones who could recite from memory. Like Jake.", "input": "", "output": "Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Jake. Oh man, Doctor Balis, this is incredible. I didn't think a man could be like this. Well, at least not a man I could date.  Phil's like this, of course.   And you're kind of neat, too.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean, \"like this?\" Maybe you should start at the beginning."}, {"instruction": "Okay, yeah. I called Phil last Wednesday, like I said I would.  He happened to have several pieces in a show that opened Saturday at...oh, I forget which gallery. He invited me to come along and I gladly accepted. I was being careful to move around, trying to get into the culture like you said. Phil got me into a few conversations, but nothing much was happening. Then, while I was admiring this huge abstract acrylic that took Phil over two months to finish, I hear a soft, strong voice speak to me. I looked and here was this well-built man with a goatee and an earring. He was staring at the painting but talking to me. He wasn't hitting on me or condescending to me like I'm some business flunky who can't understand art. And he wasn't all high-brow about it either--just matter-of-fact, like this was perfectly natural.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like it was for him. Maybe he's as comfortable in an art gallery as you are in a business meeting."}, {"instruction": "Right on the money again! He works there.  He's the assistant manager. But he never tried to sell me the piece. We just talked. I couldn't believe what I was hearing! He didn't talk about materials, or price, or even color and composition. It was about feelings, the passion conveyed in the piece. That was a very emotional painting, and he caught it all. Phil and I talked about the piece several times while he was working on it. So I knew both what I saw and what he was trying to say. Jake read it like a book. I was amazed. We parted after about ten minutes, but I couldn't keep my eyes off him the whole afternoon. He caught me looking at him a few times and just smiled back like we were old friends. Finally, Jake came over to congratulate Phil on the great response his work was getting and found out I was Phil's sister.", "input": "", "output": "How did he react to that?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he should have known. Phil and I don't look much alike, and we're about as far apart on the cultural spectrum as you can get.  But Jake said he could feel the similarity in the way we thought. Interesting. I've never had anyone feel my thoughts before.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like an interesting afternoon."}, {"instruction": "It gets better. He invited us to this poetry slam Tuesday. We went and got there just in time for Jake's first poem. He got up three times, one poem each time, but I only remember a little of it. The first one started with something like \"Darkness envelops me; We embrace as old friends; familiar lovers.\" It was something like that. After that, I just got caught up in listening to his voice--such a deep voice from such a small man. Well, he's not small, but his voice is much deeper than you'd think by looking at him. And so smooth, so melodic. And, well, sexy.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Do you really? I didn't mean that I wanted to sleep with him just because of his voice. Just that it was...the way he spoke was so...oh, I don't know. Alluring? Attractive?", "input": "", "output": "I understand. What happened then?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he saw us and came over for a while. But he was with a group and couldn't stay the whole time. I felt like an idiot. All I could do was stare at his eyes through the haze and complement him. I was fawning. Halfway through his second poem, I noticed Phil staring at me, this big grin on his face. I asked him why, and he said he was glad I was enjoying myself. But I think he was amused by my reaction to Jake.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe. Maybe he was pleased, too. Did anything else happen with Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Well, just that he asked me out.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "And we're going out Saturday morning.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that."}, {"instruction": "So you approve?", "input": "", "output": "Certainly. This sounds like just the sort of adventure you were looking for. I'm very pleased at how well you handled your first trip out of the corporate culture. You mingled, you enjoyed yourself, you took some chances. And it's nice that you met a man who doesn't bore you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm excited. I'm all giddy. That's really why I didn't go to work today--I was just too thrilled to concentrate. I couldn't get into the corporate persona. Do you think this might interfere with my work?", "input": "", "output": "I don't..."}, {"instruction": "No, I guess not. I'm pretty much settled down now. It's just that it's so new, so unexpected.", "input": "", "output": "You described to me before how you seem to feel unnerved by the unexpected sometimes."}, {"instruction": "Not this time. It's...well, I'm doing this, see? It's not being done to me.", "input": "", "output": "You feel like you're in control of the situation?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, of course. Hey, I'm giddy and all, but that doesn't mean I've lost my mind. I'm not going to let my work be affected by my personal life. I could afford the day off today, but I don't plan on making it a habit. And I'm not the kind of woman to be led around by a man. I thought you'd know that by now.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, yes I do. But I also know how easy it is to get carried away by a new and exciting experience."}, {"instruction": "Oh, you tricky devil. You managed to get in one of those warnings about getting too excited!", "input": "", "output": "That's part of my job here, Ms. Lippard."}, {"instruction": "And that's another thing. I'm not Ms. Lippard anymore, at least not when I'm in here. That's the corporate maven. I'm working on my personal life here, so can you call me Katherine?", "input": "", "output": "Okay, that's fair. Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Can I call you Charles? Or is it Charlie?", "input": "", "output": "I think we'd better stick with Doctor Balis. You're not at work here, but I am."}, {"instruction": "Huh. All right. So we have some time left. What else should we talk about?", "input": "", "output": "What's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Well, let's see. Work is okay, life is getting to be fun. Oh, my brother is separated again.", "input": "", "output": "Phil? I didn't think he was married."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm sorry, he's not. My older brother, Joey. He's a lawyer back in Columbia. He works long hours trying to make partner. He drinks. And he cheats on his wife. Every once in a while, she gets fed up and leaves him, but she always comes back. She was born to be married--she can't stay away from the mansion, the country club, the martinis on the yacht with all the society wonks and their phony Harvard accents. And Joey can't make partner without the trophy wife and 2.5 adorable children in private school. So he cleans up his act for a while and begs her back.", "input": "", "output": "Is this a pattern?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. This is at least the third time she's left. And I'll bet the farm, it turns out the same way. \"Bet the farm.\" I don't think I've ever said that before.", "input": "", "output": "You've never talked about any of your family other than Phil. Are you close to Joey?"}, {"instruction": "No. We can talk about finance, a little. But he's such a fake--pursuing the American dream, shaping his personal life and that of his wife and kids to get what he wants. Besides, he's always been distant. I get the feeling he always resented me for being born.", "input": "", "output": "He was the oldest and an only child until you came along?"}, {"instruction": "Exactly. Then when Dad left, he decided to be the man of the house. He got all authoritative and bossy. So I just took care of Phil and tried to ignore Joey.", "input": "", "output": "What about your mother?"}, {"instruction": "She worked all the time. We kind of had to work out the hierarchy for ourselves. Okay. Well, I guess I should go.", "input": "", "output": "We can take the time if you want to get into this."}, {"instruction": "No, that's enough for one day. See you next time.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Ms. Lipp...excuse me, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "So how was your date?"}, {"instruction": "Wonderful! I couldn't believe it, Jake is like no one I've ever met before. He's charming, and sweet, and...well, natural. You know, I'm so used to the stuffy business types, all educated and formal--with a tie, a candlelight dinner, and a Lincoln Town Car. This is a real change. And damnit, Doctor, I like it!", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you had a good time. Want to tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. He called early to tell me to dress warm. I didn't understand that--it being June and all. But he was mysterious about it, and I decided to play along. Well, he showed up on a motorcycle! Oh, wow, what a blast! And at sixty miles an hour, even in eighty degree weather, it was cold. But it was wonderful! The road just right there a few feet away. Leaning into the turns. The roar of the engine...exhilarating.", "input": "", "output": "You've never been on a motorcycle before?"}, {"instruction": "No, I haven't. I want to go again, soon.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Something wrong with that?", "input": "", "output": "Well, motorcycles can be dangerous, particularly with no experience. He might have asked you first, to be sure you were comfortable with that."}, {"instruction": "Oh, Jake's an excellent driver. And he insisted I wear a helmet, although he didn't. He said it dulls his senses.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And he has a stereo on it. On the highway, he was singing along. Some group...birds? Crows? Yeah, something about crows. Many Crows? I caught parts of it--heavy, deep thinking stuff, just what I'd expect from him.", "input": "", "output": "Where did you go?"}, {"instruction": "He said he was taking me to the mud flats. I was thinking great, a swamp or something. But it was nice--trees, open spaces, breezes. We had a picnic. It's a big bike--he just kept taking stuff out of the saddlebags, wine, fruit, French bread, cheese, pat\u00e9. It was really romantic.", "input": "", "output": "Gold Wing?"}, {"instruction": "Excuse me?", "input": "", "output": "The motorcycle, was it a Honda Gold Wing?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no. I've seen those--real luxury. This was more serious than that. Loud and...um, authoritative. More like a real motorcycle--more...um, pure. No windshield, exposed engine--that sort of thing. It's a Yamaha, 1300 something. Something 1300. Whatever. Counting Crows!", "input": "", "output": "Sorry?"}, {"instruction": "The tape he was listening to. The group was called Counting Crows.", "input": "", "output": "Oh. So you enjoyed the picnic?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. Jake is...well, we talked about everything. Child-rearing, although neither of us has kids, politics, science, philosophy. The weather. Everything but finance. He wouldn't recite any poetry for me, though. He says poetry is nighttime stuff. We were there for hours, talking, walking around; we even played frisbee for a while. But...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he never laughed. I was having a great time and several things struck me funny, particularly when we were chasing that frisbee around on the wind. I laughed a lot, it felt great. But Jake didn't laugh. He smiled sometimes, but it's like he's so serious. No, that's not right. He takes things seriously. I think he was having fun, but it was as if...I don't know. Like there's too much on his mind for the laughter to get through. Am I making sense?", "input": "", "output": "I get the idea."}, {"instruction": "I mean he's real smart, and he knows a lot, and he thinks a lot. Maybe that's it.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe he was just reserved, nervous about making a good impression."}, {"instruction": "I get the feeling Jake is never nervous. He has this incredible poise about him--great inner strength, and confidence. I think it's something else.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Um hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Something more?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'm through with Jake. Shall we move on?", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Well, I though you might have some ideas.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I do. You talked a little about your family background last week. Would you like to expand on that?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Some basic history first?", "input": "", "output": "That would be fine."}, {"instruction": "Okay. There's Joey, named for my dad, Joseph...um, Richard Lippard. Joey's 35. He's a senior associate at Cheatum, Craven & Swine in Columbia...", "input": "", "output": "Cheatum, Craven & Swine? Is that really the name of the firm?"}, {"instruction": "No, that's just what I call them. It's really...uh, Cheatham, Calvin, something-or-other. I've just always called them that. I don't even remember the real names.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Sorry I interrupted you, that just sounded odd. Please go on."}, {"instruction": "I think I already told you about his marriage and kids. He has a boy, Jeffrey, 8, and a girl, Lynn, 6. They're in the best private school in the midlands, and they go to camp in the summer. I'll have to say, though, Joey does seem to really love the kids. Then there's my mom, also in Columbia. That's her home town. All her family is there. We moved there when Daddy left. And we all went to USC--that's South Carolina, not Southern Cal. Joey majored in Political Science and then law school. I majored in Accounting, then a CPA, then the MBA from Harvard. I told you how I did that, didn't I?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you did."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Then Phil never managed to declare a major, just took what he wanted for a while, did poorly, and dropped out to become a starving artist. We all worked through school, but Mom somehow came up with a lot of the money. We found out later that she had thousands in mutual funds and treasury notes. All the time after Daddy left, while she was working two and three jobs, she kept us living at the poverty line, while she socked away money for college.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "How do you keep doing that? You always know just when to ask the tricky questions.", "input": "", "output": "It's part of my training to recognize these opportunities."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess it would be. Well, I feel two ways. I appreciate that she saved all that money, looking out for us so we could go to college and all. But I kind of resent it, too.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "We were so poor. We had subsidized lunches at school. Phil and I wore Joey's clothes years after they went out of style. We ate beans and macaroni & cheese two nights a week. Kids shunned us, and teachers felt sorry for us. And all that time, it turns out Mom was making decent money. We could have had decent things. Doctor Balis, is it wrong of me to resent my mother for doing what she thought was best at the time?", "input": "", "output": "Feelings are not right or wrong, or even good or bad. They just are. Your emotions exist, they're part of you. You can't judge your worth by how you feel."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I'm not sure I agree with that. But let's table that for the moment, shall we? More history.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "So we were poor. Then we all went to school, and two of us got post-graduate degrees. Phil was never very interested in school and dropped out. Now, he's poor and aimless, but feels good about it. Joey and I both took the corporate track and are rich and successful, but we're all screwed up.", "input": "", "output": "Interesting difference."}, {"instruction": "Isn't it, though? I keep wondering how that happened. We all grew up the same, had the same opportunities, no one was abused. Then I think, maybe it was Daddy.", "input": "", "output": "What about your father?"}, {"instruction": "Well...huh. Yeah, what about my father?", "input": "", "output": "You've said he left. Was there a divorce?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess you could say that. He abandoned us, that's all. Went off to Alaska to pursue his dream. What do you think of that? Wife and three kids depending on him. Has a good job and good pay. And then one day, he just says nope, don't want a family no more, going to go live in the wilderness and be a bush pilot now. How's that for respectable? How's that for family responsibility?", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you harbor some resentment there."}, {"instruction": "Oh, fuck you, Doctor Balis! Why do we always have to get into that? Fuck how I feel. It doesn't matter. Oh, damnit.", "input": "", "output": "Here..."}, {"instruction": "I don't need no damn tissues! Oh! Oh shit, I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry. Here, I'll get it.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. Are you okay now?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Yes, I'm sorry. Um...time's about up, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, it's okay to..."}, {"instruction": "No, no, no, no, it's not okay. I'm thirty-two years old, and that happened a long time ago, and I should be over it by now. I am not going to get angry, and I am not going to cry. It's over.", "input": "", "output": "Obviously, there's still some strong feelings there."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...well, I'm tired of it. I'm getting on with my life. I have a good job. And I met a nice man. And...well, that's that. Time's up.", "input": "", "output": "Are you okay to drive?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I'm fine. See? Rock solid.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. See you next week then?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Thank you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "I'm here if you need me, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.  Good night.", "input": "", "output": "Good night."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Come in, come in. Sit down. Is everything okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah...um...I mean, I think so. Look, I'm sorry about how I acted last week.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, there's no need to apologize. It's all right to get emotional in here, that's part of the therapeutic process. In fact, I think I should commend you for it."}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "I don't believe that the Katherine Lippard I met two months ago--the corporate maven as you've called her--could have delved that deeply into her feelings. You were closed and controlled then, completely wrapped up in the corporate persona. It's great progress to be able to talk about issues that might be painful and that have a lot of emotions attached to them."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. It may not be as much progress as you think, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Two months ago, I was hanging on by a thread. You saw me...well, remember why I originally came in here?", "input": "", "output": "You lost control when a particular seat at a sushi bar was not available to you. That broke your lunch routine."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I got all uncorked about it. But it wasn't an isolated incident. I mean, it was, but...oh, hell. Let me start again. That may have been the only time I really lost my cool about some little thing. But something like that was bound to happen. I was just barely hanging on to my composure most of the time. I've been so close to losing it so many times. I'm...well, it's scary.", "input": "", "output": "And how long had this been going on?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's been building ever since I moved here. I thought it was just being nervous about a new place and a new job, but it got worse instead of better. That's the real reason I came to see you, Doctor. It wasn't the incident at Kansai. I felt like I was losing my mind. Well, at least my composure.", "input": "", "output": "I see. How have you been feeling recently?"}, {"instruction": "Better. Yeah, I'm calmer now. I'm still edgy, but I'm calmer. I think the Apple project, with the board meeting and all, really boosted my confidence. And working with you has helped. It gives me some breathing room--like it's not so urgent any more. I feel like at least I'm doing something about it now. So when my feelings get overwhelming and I feel panicky, I can think: \"I'll talk to Balis about this.\" Or I can have an actual conversation with you, right then, in my head.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you feel like therapy is helping. And I do think that you've shown a lot of progress in a short time."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. That's good to hear. So, um...what should we talk about?", "input": "", "output": "What's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Somehow, I knew you were going to say that. You're the doctor here. You have a better idea of where feelings come from. I'm just a CPA.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. We left off last week talking about your father. Would you like to continue with that?"}, {"instruction": "And again, I knew you would say that. Okay, but I don't want a repeat of last time. I mean, I know it's okay to get emotional with you, but still it's not comfortable for me.", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "So I'll ease into it, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Certainly."}, {"instruction": "My father was a pilot. He was in the Air Force when I was born, in Charleston. But he quit soon after. My memories start in Charlotte...well, at the end of when we were in Charlotte--about the time we were going to move. I guess I was six or seven. We moved to Atlanta. Daddy got a job flying bigger jets. He worked for Delta. Mom tried to make it sound like a great thing--Daddy'll fly the big planes, we'll have a nice new house, and all that jazz. But I hated the idea. I had just started school. I had my friends in the neighborhood, and I didn't want to move. That makes sense, doesn't it? What six-year-old wants to move away from all her friends?", "input": "", "output": "That's a common reaction, yes."}, {"instruction": "So we moved to Atlanta, and Daddy was gone for days at a time. He used to fly commuters, so he was able to come home every night. Now, he was flying cross-country and spent many nights away from home. Toward the end, he even got some international flights, and we wouldn't see him for almost a week sometimes. So Mom got a job. All the kids were in school and Daddy was away most of the time--she got a job. No big deal, right? Philip and I went to the same school. I walked him to and from school and looked after him from the time school got out until Mom got home. We got close. My friends didn't like my little brother tagging along--they teased him and stuff--but I stood up for him. I wouldn't let them tease him.", "input": "", "output": "So you've always been close to Philip?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, always. I don't remember any time when we had the normal sibling rivalry thing.", "input": "", "output": "What about your older brother? Joey?"}, {"instruction": "Joey. No, Joey was Mama's little angel--doted on and above it all. That's something I never understood. He was the first born. He was named after my father. But Daddy had little to do with him. They were never really close. Unless...you know, Mom really loved Daddy. I mean,she really adored him. I wonder if Daddy named Joey after himself or if it was Mom's doing?", "input": "", "output": "You could ask your mother."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I could. Do you think it's significant?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know.  But it sounds like you're interested. Tell me more about your family. Were you close to your father?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. As much as Joey was Mama's boy, I was Daddy's little girl. He always hugged me first when he came home. I was always on his lap. When I skinned my knee or had a bad dream, I always went to Daddy. I hated it when he wasn't there. Somehow Mom's kisses never made it better, but Daddy's always did. I mean, not just the idea, but really. The pain actually went away when Daddy fixed it. I know it was all in my head, but it was real, you know? I can even remember a time when I had skinned my knee and Mom put that stuff on it she used to use--Witch Hazel or something, stings like mad--and then she kissed it to make it better, but it didn't get better. I remember crying to her: \"it didn't work, your kisses never work, I want Daddy.\" But, of course, he was off in Timbuktu or something, and the knee was scabbed over by the time he got home. But I made him kiss it anyway.", "input": "", "output": "What about Philip? Did he favor a particular parent?"}, {"instruction": "No, not that I can recall. Phil was an accident--they hadn't planned on more kids. I guess there was one for each of them, and that was enough. They kind of shared him, as best as I can recall. And of course, I took care of him a lot.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Okay. So, we're in Atlanta, Joey's in middle school, Phil and I in elementary school, Daddy's gone a lot of the time, although he gets to spend days in a row at home not flying at all. And Mom's a bank teller--that bugged Daddy to no end. I remember them arguing about it. She said she couldn't take a vacation every time he happened to be home. He wanted her there more, she wanted him home more. I think Mama might have missed Daddy as much as I did when he was gone.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. But he was my Daddy, and I was his little girl. Somehow that was more important to me.", "input": "", "output": "That's understandable. Children have very little understanding or consideration for other people's feelings and relationships. They're only familiar with their own, and those are the ones they focus on."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Okay. And then one day, Mom announces that Daddy's leaving. Except he's not coming back this time.", "input": "", "output": "How old were you then?"}, {"instruction": "I would have been ten? Eleven? Something like that.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I was upset. I cried. I held on to him. I told him he couldn't leave forever--he had to stay. It was a scene. He took me aside and tried to explain, but I was having none of it.", "input": "", "output": "What did he tell you?"}, {"instruction": "He said he'd been thinking about this a long time, and that it was the right thing to do. Sometimes grown-ups had to make hard decisions, and one day I'd understand. That and all those placating, condescending things adults tell children when they're doing the wrong thing. But I think he really believed it all, I really do. And I know it was hard for him, too.", "input": "", "output": "How do you know?"}, {"instruction": "Because he cried. That's the only time I ever saw my Daddy cry. You know, I just can't understand it...where are the damn tissues?", "input": "", "output": "Here."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I don't get it, Doctor Balis. If it was so hard for him to leave me, why did he do it? If it hurt him so badly, certainly he must have felt it wasn't right? How could he do it? What was he thinking?", "input": "", "output": "That's hard to know. Do you have any contact with him now?"}, {"instruction": "No. I haven't heard from him in years. I remember thinking every time I accomplished something, how proud he'd be, and how much I wanted him there. Graduation, CPA, the time I was in the school play. I even wanted to tell him about my first kiss, and about how much my first love was like him. But, by then, I wasn't even sure if he was dead or alive.", "input": "", "output": "Wouldn't you have heard something if he died?"}, {"instruction": "I doubt it. Mom said he just abdicated everything--went off to Alaska penniless and free. No pension, no income, no insurance.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Some people said that it must have taken some real courage to leave every thing like that. Courage, yeah. What kind of courage does it take to abandon your ten-year-old daughter for some crazy dream?", "input": "", "output": "That would be a good place to start next week. Right now, our time is about up."}, {"instruction": "God, already? Okay. Boy, this is hard. Does it get worse?", "input": "", "output": "It's hard work. But you're doing very well. I'm very impressed by the work you've done so far."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. I'm okay now. I'll go home, clean my house, and get on with my life. Oh, man. I never even got to tell you about Jake.", "input": "", "output": "Something significant?"}, {"instruction": "No, I just wanted to tell you about our last date. But I guess it can wait.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Good night, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hi.", "input": "", "output": "Are you okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Just a little scared, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "What are you afraid of?"}, {"instruction": "Feelings. Losing it. Last week was really hard. I know you warned me there would be hard times, but I don't think I was ready for that. I've been dreading this all day--going through that again.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. You're feeling very powerful emotions, probably ones you're not used to."}, {"instruction": "Not used to? I guess fucking not. Sorry--that was uncalled for. But no, the only thing I've felt for my father since...oh, since high school graduation I guess, is a kind of weak resentment. Maybe a little longing.", "input": "", "output": "What happened at your graduation?"}, {"instruction": "He didn't show up. And no, he didn't say he would--I hadn't heard from him in years already. I just had this magical notion that he would be there. I mean, it was the biggest day of my life to that point, surely he would know that and show up. Show up because he loved me and because he was proud of me. But he didn't. And that's when I knew...oh, here I go again.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, great. I'm here for five minutes and crying already. See? This is what I was afraid of. I don't want to spend all my time crying over things I can't change. That's getting nowhere.", "input": "", "output": "On the contrary, it's a very important step. How much crying over your father did you do before you started therapy?"}, {"instruction": "A lot when he left. A couple of months or so.", "input": "", "output": "Then what?"}, {"instruction": "Then I quit. I thought I'd see him again, and he did send a couple of postcards. He even called two or three times, but I just ended up bawling the whole conversation and so did my mom. I guess he couldn't take that, because he finally stopped. Or else he died.", "input": "", "output": "Do you believe your father's dead?"}, {"instruction": "No. I can't. I want my Daddy to be alive.", "input": "", "output": "So you..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis? I'm sorry--this is empty.", "input": "", "output": "Here, there's more."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Oh, man, I'm going to be sitting in a drift of soggy tissues before this is all over. At least you have a good supply, or I'd be dripping all over the furniture.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay. Everything is ScotchGuarded."}, {"instruction": "ScotchGuarded! Oh, that's great! That's a good one. Oh, man. Thanks, I needed that.", "input": "", "output": "Are you ready to go on?"}, {"instruction": "Almost. Do you have any water or anything?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it's here. I'll get it."}, {"instruction": "I did it! I did it! I got you out from behind the desk! Glory be, the doctor has legs! But you're wearing pants.", "input": "", "output": "What did you expect?"}, {"instruction": "Well, you know, I've heard newscasters don't bother wearing pants, because you never see their legs. You know, you're a nice looking man, Doctor Balis. No flab, good posture. Handsome, boyish face. Nice.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. Here's your water."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, would you like to return to your father some other time?"}, {"instruction": "Would that be okay? I mean, I know I have to do this. And I will, I promise. It's just that...not now, okay? I'm not ready right now.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine. This is new to you--it's okay to take it slow. Is there something else you'd like to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, there is. I went out with Jake again. A few times, actually.", "input": "", "output": "And how was that?"}, {"instruction": "Um...fun. We went to the new sculpture exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art. We talked a lot. He's very calm. Thoughtful...no, that's not the word. I mean he thinks a lot. Intellectual, I guess. But it turns out he's into excitement, too.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he says he's an adrenaline junkie. He says the motorcycle's only part of that. He goes backwoods hiking, downhill skiing, rock climbing. He wants to take me hang gliding or on an ultralight, whichever I choose. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "I think those both sound like very dangerous activities, particularly with no training. I'd be concerned about your safety."}, {"instruction": "Oh, Jake has a very high rating--just short of instructor. He's certified to have passengers.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't know there was a certification system for those activities."}, {"instruction": "Well, there's none, really. Not by law, anyway. But there's a sort of self-governing body that sets rules and standards.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I'm leaning toward hang gliding. Have you ever been up to Fort Funston, where they launch off the cliffs over the ocean?", "input": "", "output": "No, I haven't seen that."}, {"instruction": "It's sort of near the zoo, on the Great Highway.  I've watched them hang glide there.  It's quiet, just you and the wind. Close to nature, part of the sky. In fact, Jake recited part of a poem about that. Something about being one with the sky, that sort of thing. See? Jake's not all dark and brooding; he has a lighter side.", "input": "", "output": "I don't recall saying he was dark and brooding. Is that a concern of yours?"}, {"instruction": "You didn't say that? I guess that was Phil. Well, the no laughing thing. And the poems about night to be recited only at night, you know? But he has fun, too. And he wants me to have fun with him!", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about Jake?"}, {"instruction": "I like him. He's smart. He's...um, adventurous. He's good-looking. He can talk about anything. I could really fall for this man.", "input": "", "output": "What about other activities away from Jake? Have you been out on your own any? Or with Phil?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I...well, no come to think of it, I haven't. I've pretty much been going out with Jake.", "input": "", "output": "Is that enough for you? I remember how excited you were about \"getting a life,\" as you put it."}, {"instruction": "Well, like you said, it's okay to take it slow. I have more life now that I did a few weeks ago. Don't push it, Doctor Balis. I'm enjoying my time with Jake. Isn't that enough for now?", "input": "", "output": "You have to answer that."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Yes, it is.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So are things getting physical with Jake? We haven't discussed how you feel about that."}, {"instruction": "We've made out a little, yeah. But Jake's a nice guy, he's not pushing anything. It's like he's not dating me for my body. He's actually said that he's more interested in my mind. But there's a healthy attraction there, too. What do you mean how I feel about that?", "input": "", "output": "I just don't know what your attitudes are about sex, that's all."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm not a virgin. I don't have anything against sex--I think it's nice. But I think there should be more to a relationship.", "input": "", "output": "That's a healthy attitude."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I keep coming back to the hang gliding. It really is a dangerous sport, and I'm concerned for your safety. It's not a bad idea to know what you're getting into in any situation. You might consider learning more about it--maybe taking a lesson or two before you go up, even as a passenger."}, {"instruction": "Your concern is duly noted, Doctor, but I am an adult. I've lived on my own for years and excelled in a world dominated by men. I think I know how to take care of myself.", "input": "", "output": "Of course you do, Katherine. I didn't mean my concern to be taken as an insult."}, {"instruction": "I know--it's part of your job. But you'll see. I'll come in next week all in one piece. And maybe, I'll be able to talk about my father then.", "input": "", "output": "That would be fine."}, {"instruction": "Okay, then I'll see you next time.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Are you feeling better?", "input": "", "output": "What?  Oh, no.  I wasn't ill.  I had a family emergency.  I'm sorry about canceling last week."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm sorry.  Is everything okay?", "input": "", "output": "It was my dad.  He's much better now and is home from the hospital, thanks. But we're not here to talk about me."}, {"instruction": "No, I guess not.  Well, here I am, all in one piece as promised.", "input": "", "output": "So you are.  Did I see you limping?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, a little. It didn't happen during hang gliding, though. We didn't get to go last weekend, the weather wasn't right.  So we went last Sunday.  Oh, it was incredible! Better than I had imagined. Such freedom! We soared, and swooped, and dived--it was awesome. I don't think I've ever felt so alive. And Jake was so wonderful, smiling more than I've ever seen before. Gone was the dark, somber, deep thinker, and in his place, a free spirit, excited and enjoying life. A girl could almost fall in love, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Almost?"}, {"instruction": "Well...so after we landed, I was dancing around, literally jumping for joy, making a fool of myself at the top of this cliff, when I came down wrong on a loose rock and fell. I have the most incredible bruise on my butt. But when we got home, Jake...well, he kissed it and made it better.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it was so sweet and romantic. We got in, I was limping pretty badly, and he said, \"That really hurts, doesn't it?\" I said it did, and he said, \"Here, maybe I can help.\" He came around behind me, slipped off my shorts, then he got down on one knee and kissed my...um, bruise. And it got better! It really felt better, I didn't just imagine it. I could move more and everything.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So then--and this is the really wonderful part--he slid my pants back on, kissed me sweetly on the lips, and went to make me some tea. It wasn't an excuse to get my pants off, it wasn't about seduction. He just wanted to make me feel better. And it worked.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you had a good time."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. Oh my, yes. I've never felt so alive. The sky and the man...the wonderful man who cares so much about me. And the exhilaration...it was magical.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. And that you came back relatively unscathed."}, {"instruction": "We made love that night.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, first time. That's another wonderful thing about Jake--he never pushed for sex. We've been going out...what, a month now? And he seemed content to wait another month, if that's what it took for me to be comfortable. But Sunday I was. And it was amazing. Stupendous. Words do not begin to describe it. It was the best sex I've ever had, not for being the most exciting or the number and strength of my orgasms--although, I think I set records there, too. We were at it for hours. And it was great because of the feeling behind it. I mean, sex is not always a chore. Sometimes, it can be a lot of fun. But it's always been just something you do--like another recreational activity during a date. But this was different. This was about us, about our wanting to be together. Wow, I didn't know it could be like this.", "input": "", "output": "So you've never experienced sex as a sharing, as an expression of emotion between two people in love?"}, {"instruction": "How could I? I've never been in love.", "input": "", "output": "Are you in love with Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Well that's another question entirely, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Is it?"}, {"instruction": "How am I suppose to tell? What are the signs? Define it for me.", "input": "", "output": "Love is an emotion, Katherine. And like any emotion it's very hard to define in concrete terms..."}, {"instruction": "Come on, Balis, you're a psychiatrist. Emotions are your job. You can do better than that.", "input": "", "output": "What does it mean to you?"}, {"instruction": "I knew you'd say that. Okay, love. Hmm. Love is caring. Closeness. Like his life means more to me than my own. Like I always want to be with him--there's this longing all the time that we're apart. I get this tingly, butterfly sensation when the phone rings and I think it's him. I can tell him anything, he'll keep any secret. I can forgive any little annoyance--the way he flosses twice a day, and how he lets the dishes stack up two sinks full before he washes them. I can't look at him without smiling. I feel so good to be with him. I just want to do everything for him. I want to make him happy any way I can.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel this way about Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Well, who did you think I was talking about?", "input": "", "output": "So..."}, {"instruction": "So what? Oh. So, am I in love with him? Well, it sounds that way, doesn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it does."}, {"instruction": "Is that good?", "input": "", "output": "How does it feel to you?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. It feels pretty good, actually. Okay, I'm in love with Jake Winter. For the first time in my life, I'm in love. And that's okay.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I'm glad you're comfortable with that. I'm happy for you."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I want to make sure I heard something right. Did you say, \"his life means more to me than my own?\""}, {"instruction": "Yes. So?", "input": "", "output": "Is that how you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I mean, if it came down to one of us having to die, I'd rather it be me. I'd want him to go on living. What's wrong with that?", "input": "", "output": "When you put it that way, nothing. I can appreciate these feelings. I was concerned that you might have meant that you couldn't live without him."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. You mean like if we broke up, I'd kill myself?", "input": "", "output": "You understand, I have to be alert to these things."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know that. Don't worry, Doctor Balis. If Jake dumps me, I promise to call you before I slit my throat. But I don't see that happening.", "input": "", "output": "I certainly hope not."}, {"instruction": "Me too.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I hate to bring up a touchy subject, but are you practicing safe sex?"}, {"instruction": "Um...well, not this time. But I have an appointment Friday morning to get a shot. Depo-Provera--very convenient, no side effects. Well, at least less than the pill.", "input": "", "output": "That's very good, but pregnancy is not the only danger."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, Jake and I have discussed this. It's not as if this was a total surprise. Neither of us has ever had anything, and it's not like he's been sleeping around indiscriminately.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you trust him, but you can't be sure about what his former partners have been doing. AIDS can be carried for years before disease develops, and there are other sexually transmitted diseases that can hibernate symptom-free for some time. Syphilis, for instance. I'd to encourage you both to get tested."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I'll think about that.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe you could discuss it with Jake."}, {"instruction": "Maybe I could.", "input": "", "output": "When are you planning to see him again?"}, {"instruction": "Tonight. We're going to the symphony. I'll get to see him in a tie. But we can't make love again like that--I'll never be able to get to work tomorrow. Besides, I want to get the shot first.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. But please, think about getting tested. And remember, it's only good if you both go."}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay, I said I'd consider it, and I will. What you say makes sense.", "input": "", "output": "Good. We have some time left, is there anything else you'd like to discuss?"}, {"instruction": "You mean like my father? I know we have to get into that again, and I actually planned on doing it today. But we got a little sidetracked, didn't we? I don't think that there's enough time left to really go there right now. I feel like this is a pretty deep issue.", "input": "", "output": "It is. Would you like to call it a day then?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I can use the extra time. And we'll get back to my father, I promise.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "Next time. Plan on it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Good. Good night, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Well, this is about Jake, and I came to talk about my father.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, we can talk about anything you want to."}, {"instruction": "Okay, this is small anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "We went to the symphony--me and Jake and Phil and...um, I don't remember her name, some knockout Phil brought. He has this way, I don't know what it is. He's a perfectly ordinary looking guy--a little skinny, poor most of the time, but he attracts these absolutely gorgeous women. Rich, attractive, smart, educated...", "input": "", "output": "Sounds a little like you."}, {"instruction": "Hmm, I guess so. Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "You talk about your brother in glowing terms--you can see how appealing he is. These other women can, too."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I guess so. So anyway, afterwards, when we were alone, I told Jake I loved him.", "input": "", "output": "How did that go over?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing.", "input": "", "output": "He had no response at all?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he looked at me seriously and said, \"Are you sure?\" I said yes, and he smiled kind of sweet and then kissed me. We made out some, and then he went home. We didn't make love--I had to go to work the next day. He's not all about sex.", "input": "", "output": "So you've said. How do you feel about that response?"}, {"instruction": "I kind of thought he'd say it back. That would have been great, you know? Then we'd both be in love, and comfortable, and...live happily ever after, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you want?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know. I mean, I've never really seen myself married, and I'm not good with kids.", "input": "", "output": "Does being in love mean having a husband and family?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so. Doesn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Does it?"}, {"instruction": "What else is it for?", "input": "", "output": "Maybe it's not for anything. Maybe feelings can just be feelings, for their own sake."}, {"instruction": "Well, I know I don't want to end up like my mother.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Mama was in love with Daddy. I mean really, seriously in love. She couldn't get enough of him. Remember I told you about the argument when she said she couldn't stand for him to be away so much? I guess that's something we have in common--neither of us could get enough of Daddy. I even resented the time she got to spend alone with him. Hmm...I wonder if she felt the same way about me? If she was jealous of the attention Daddy paid me?", "input": "", "output": "That could be."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. So anyway, when Daddy left, my mother was just crushed. She was in love with him, and life was perfect. And then, he disappeared. I don't want that.", "input": "", "output": "That's understandable. Are you afraid that will happen with Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's not like we're married.", "input": "", "output": "No."}, {"instruction": "Did you just say that it's okay to be in love and not do anything with it, not take it any farther? That I can just be in love and that's it?", "input": "", "output": "Basically. What do you mean, \"take it farther?\""}, {"instruction": "Well, promises. Commitment. I guess it's too soon to be talking about marriage, but maybe living together.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, it may be too soon for any of that. You've only known him what? Six weeks? Love can be a fleeting thing; you should give it some time to solidify, to get to know each other better. Plus, you don't really know how Jake feels about this."}, {"instruction": "That's true. He never did respond.", "input": "", "output": "Right. Give it some time. I know you're excited about the recent changes in your life, but it can't happen all at once."}, {"instruction": "I guess not. But damn it, I've been alone for twenty years. I want it to happen now! Oh, well...", "input": "", "output": "Jake is the first man you've dated seriously, right?"}, {"instruction": "Well, no. There was Andrew in Charlotte. He was a pilot.", "input": "", "output": "Were you in love?"}, {"instruction": "No. That didn't last too long, a couple of months.", "input": "", "output": "So you dated Andrew for a few months, years ago, and now Jake for even less time. You really don't have much experience, Katherine. I think you should take it slow, see how things develop. You may find you're not compatible."}, {"instruction": "I guess so. So you're saying I should just date Jake for awhile, not push anything, and see what turns up?", "input": "", "output": "That sounds reasonable."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Do you still want to talk about your father?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I promised, didn't I?", "input": "", "output": "You did, and I think it's important. You mentioned how your mother felt when your father left. What about you?"}, {"instruction": "I think I covered that already. It destroyed my world. I didn't think I could ever be happy or feel safe, again. And Mama wasn't much help, although she was much stronger about it than I was. Once she pulled herself back together and went back to work, she pretty much gave all her attention to Joey. He became the man of the house, but he was 13? 14? He just got bossy and smart-mouthed, but my mother let him get away with everything and always came to his defense. I heard someone in school call him a mama's boy, and I thought, \"Yeah, that's about right.\"", "input": "", "output": "So your relationship with your mother changed after your father left?"}, {"instruction": "A little, I guess. I mean, Joey was always her child anyway, just like I was Daddy's. He just became more hers, and I was no one's. She pretty much left Phil and me alone, unless we got in trouble. That's when I started getting so close to Phil; I had no one else and no one was really taking care of him, paying him any attention. I guess Joey was Mama's child and Phil was mine. We had our own little world--our own little code so my mother and Joey wouldn't know what we were talking about. Phil's the only one that calls me Kate, or sometimes Katie, and I was the only one who called him Phil. I don't even know if they knew that. To this day, they still call us Katherine and Philip.", "input": "", "output": "How is your relationship with your mother now?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess. We speak. I visit sometimes. She has her life, and I have mine. I don't think you could call us close.", "input": "", "output": "Is there any tension?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah, I guess. I mean, she could have taken care of me. Oh, I guess she did. I mean, she did pay for college and all--that's got to count for something. And Phil...I know he was an accident and all, Mama already had a boy, and Daddy had a girl. But Jeez, if I hadn't fed him, I don't think Phil would have eaten after Daddy left. And now he's the best adjusted of all of us, Mama included. Go figure.", "input": "", "output": "I think you can take some credit for that."}, {"instruction": "Huh? What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you were primarily responsible for his emotional upbringing, and you were only a child yourself in the bargain. And it was more than just the emotional support.  You were feeding him, getting him to school, helping him with his homework.  You must have done a remarkable job."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I guess so. I never looked at it like that.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like your mother was content to leave you and Phil to your own devices.  You took on the role of a mother for Phil and took that responsibility very seriously.  In fact, with what sounds like very little help from your mother, you raised Phil and yourself at the same time."}, {"instruction": "Well, what choice did she have? She had to work two and three jobs to support her family; there wasn't much time left over.", "input": "", "output": "She could have chosen to treat all of her children equally, rather than spoiling one and leaving the other two..."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Spoiling. I wonder if that's why Joey's the way he is today? But you know what? There was one thing she didn't spoil him about. He wanted to become a pilot, like Daddy. Oh, she was having none of that! She absolutely put her foot down. There wasn't even any argument. I've never seen her treat anyone that way, least of all Joey. To this day she won't even let him take flying lessons.", "input": "", "output": "How can she stop him? He's an adult now."}, {"instruction": "But she's Mama, and he's Mama's Boy. He won't go against her; he won't risk losing her.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "We didn't get in much about Daddy, did we?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I think we covered a lot of ground. How your family relationships changed after your father left is very significant. Unfortunately, we're about out of time for today. Shall we pick up here next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Strangely, it feels good to talk about this. I don't feel like I'm really working through anything, though.", "input": "", "output": "Well, we're doing the groundwork. We have to find out what the issues are before we can work on resolving them."}, {"instruction": "And what are the issues?", "input": "", "output": "We can talk about that next week. Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. How are you today?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess. Major came in twice this week, wanting to look over some spreadsheets and forecasts. I think he may be up to something, but I don't know what. I hope he doesn't have some new scheme to take over IBM or General Motors or something.", "input": "", "output": "He seems quite ambitious."}, {"instruction": "You've met him?", "input": "", "output": "You  talked about him and the Apple merger deal quite a bit some weeks ago. And remember, I am the company's therapist--I have other patients from SII."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Very evasive.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to talk more about your work?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'm just a little antsy is all. Frank is doing less and less, and I'm taking more responsibility for the company. It's a slow but smooth transition.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So, I suppose I should get started. Well, Jake still hasn't answered me. Not that I've pressed him on it. He did mention that his parents are divorced, his father twice. And his stepsister--his father's wife's daughter from her first marriage--is also divorced. So among the four people he can call his family, there are five divorces.", "input": "", "output": "Jake is an only child?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think of his family's history?"}, {"instruction": "It could explain his reluctance to commit. And I read some more of his poetry. Sad. It's all about darkness and tragedy, and how love always comes due in blood.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did you talk to him about that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he doesn't actually know I've seen it. I read it while he was asleep Saturday night.", "input": "", "output": "Oh. If you were curious, couldn't you ask him for it?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't know I was curious. I couldn't sleep, so I was just poking around and found this notebook. I read one--I knew I shouldn't--but I just kept going. It was fascinating. I knew he was deep and dark sometimes, but this was just amazing. It's so different from the way he acts usually. I mean he has such a zest for life--always on the go, doing things, nothing half way. And he chases excitement--the motorcycle, the bungee jumping, all that stuff. He's not depressed, not like the poems sounded.", "input": "", "output": "Some people can express different aspects of their personalities in different ways. His poetry could just be a release for his darker feelings. And any artwork, poetry included, involves embellishment. While there are probably real feelings behind them, the poems may represent a substantial amplification of those feelings."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Has this changed the way you feel about Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I think I actually have more compassion for him, knowing the pain he's had in his life. I'm looking at him a little differently, though.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "Well, maybe it's just my perception, but I think he's treating me a little different lately. Since I told him, I mean.", "input": "", "output": "Since you told him you love him?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. He's...I don't know...cockier. Like he's not trying so hard to please me, like he's sure now that I'm attached to him. Maybe I'm just paranoid--I've been used so much as a trophy, like an accessory by men who need a pretty woman on their arm to go with their silk tie and their Rolex. I guess I'm overly sensitive to that.", "input": "", "output": "That's understandable. Still, don't discount your perceptions. It's good to keep an open mind, and see if this behavior continues."}, {"instruction": "Maybe he's just settling into the relationship. The real courting is over, and now comes the comfortable part. So he can't admit he loves me, so what? He treats me well, he obviously cares for me a lot. Can't that be enough?", "input": "", "output": "Can it?"}, {"instruction": "What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "I wonder if you're rationalizing just a bit."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.  So let's talk more about my father.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure we're through with Jake yet."}, {"instruction": "I am. I'm going to keep an open mind, see how he treats me, and try to get him to talk more about his family and how he feels about love. Now let's move on.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Enough Jake for today."}, {"instruction": "So my father sent a couple of postcards from Alaska: \"Isn't this pretty? I'm discovering myself,\" that sort of thing. There was also one picture of himself with this old plane he bought. I can still see it--he was letting his hair grow and was beaming at the camera, like he owned the world. He looked so proud of that plane and of himself. God how I wished I could be there. I asked him when he called sometimes--well, twice, actually--if I could come live with him. He said there were no schools, no kids to play with. I didn't care, I wanted my Daddy. But he wouldn't let me come. I thought about running away, but I knew I couldn't make it all the way there. By the time I could, I didn't know where he was any more.", "input": "", "output": "Here's the tissues."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Then after high school, I thought maybe he'd think I was old enough, but he didn't show up. So I got on with my life. I became a successful businesswoman. Soon I'll have my name on the banner of the up-and-coming computer company of the decade. We've had feature stories this year in Business Week and the Journal, did you know that? But the men who say they love me are jerks, and the men I love all run off to pursue their dreams. Dreams that don't include me.", "input": "", "output": "All the men you love?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. Daddy went to Alaska, Andrew to the Coast Guard to do drug interdiction, and Phil to California for his art. Hell, I even subsidized Phil's trip.", "input": "", "output": "But you're here with Phil."}, {"instruction": "Well, someone had to take care of him. Poor starving artist. Besides, I got this great opportunity at SII.", "input": "", "output": "Those are the reasons you left your job, friends, and family and moved across the country?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, you asshole. No, not really. I followed Philip to California because I was tired of losing people. Okay?", "input": "", "output": "Okay. It's good that you recognize that and admit it."}, {"instruction": "It's pathetic, is what it is.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Because I'm no good without a man, be it my father or brother or lover. I can't make it on my own; I have to have a man in my life. Some feminist.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, everyone likes to feel connected, to love, and to be loved. It's not a weakness to want to hold onto your relationships, to want to stay close to people who mean something to you."}, {"instruction": "But it's a strength to be able to function on your own, to be independent.", "input": "", "output": "It is a strength, yes. But is it desirable?"}, {"instruction": "What? Of course it's desirable. Are you saying I shouldn't be able to function on my own?", "input": "", "output": "Excuse me, that didn't come out just right. I agree that you should be able to be alone. Needing to have someone all the time fosters dependence; being able to function independently fosters self-reliance. But I also believe that you can be self-reliant in the context of a loving relationship. You don't have to be alone to be independent."}, {"instruction": "Um, so just because I want to have...to be close to someone, doesn't mean I can't take care of myself?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. It's not a weakness to want other people in your life. It may be unhealthy to be unable to function without another person in your life.  Clearly you can function well on your own, and that's good. You make a living, you feed yourself, stay healthy. But what about your emotional well-being? Do you feel incomplete without a relationship?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah, I guess. There's an emptiness, a loneliness. I can be content on my own, but I sure do get bored.", "input": "", "output": "So you're content when you're not in a relationship?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, mostly.", "input": "", "output": "Are you happy?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. I'm lonely. Like there's a piece missing--a hole in my heart or something. I'm okay by myself, but I'd sure rather be with someone else.", "input": "", "output": "It's important to be comfortable with yourself so that you don't jump into a relationship just to fill a void."}, {"instruction": "Well, if I was comfortable with myself, I wouldn't have come to you in the first place, would I?", "input": "", "output": "I suppose not. So you're doing the work you need in order to find that peace."}, {"instruction": "Lately, I don't feel like I'm making any headway. I remember the feelings I had the first few weeks--everything was coming together. I don't have those any more. I feel like I keep talking about the same things over and over and not getting anywhere. I'm just spinning my wheels.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I hate to bring this up again, but I did mention that there might come a time when you feel this way. In therapy there are ebbs and flows, and sometimes, it even feels like things are regressing instead of making progress. But we're always learning more about you and your issues. Stick with it; I'm confident you'll notice that there'll be progress again soon."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I do remember you warning me about this. I didn't want to hear it, as I recall. Thanks. I guess I needed that.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Good night, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Sorry to change my appointment on such short notice--Major was snooping around again.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I can't figure what he wants. He's been in several times in the past few weeks, riling up the staff, going through files, projections, forecasts, balance sheets...", "input": "", "output": "Has he given you any explanation?"}, {"instruction": "No, and I asked. I told him that if he tells me what he's after, I could help him find it. He just mutters something about an audit. When I pressed him on it, he said he was the goddamn CEO and he would look at any file he wanted to in his own company. Lloyd may be my boss, but I don't appreciate him going behind my back. Not to mention that he's not qualified to audit my books--he's an administrator and idea man, not a number-cruncher. I'm telling you, I'm thinking of auditing him.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I wonder what he's after. I think I already mentioned that I think he may be looking for money for some new takeover scheme or something. I'm beginning to wonder if he's not already skimming.", "input": "", "output": "Wouldn't you know about that?"}, {"instruction": "He does have some discretionary funds, and there are some aspects of the company's books I'm not familiar with. I was planning to start a complete audit after Frank announced his retirement anyway--I wanted to get familiar with everything and make a smooth transition. Maybe I'll start early--like Monday.", "input": "", "output": "What does Frank think of all this?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't seen much of him lately. He's out all this week, which may be why Major picked right now to really get in my shit. But Frank's spending less and less time around, letting me do more of his work. I can tell you, though, we're going to talk about Major just as soon as he gets back. The staff is going nuts, too. I don't know what they think. I suppose we should talk about that.", "input": "", "output": "About what your staff might think?"}, {"instruction": "No, no, not me and you talk. I meant I should talk with the staff.", "input": "", "output": "Oh. That sounds like a good idea."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...", "input": "", "output": "Katherine? You still here?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah...um, sorry. Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "What if I found him?", "input": "", "output": "Found who?"}, {"instruction": "My father.", "input": "", "output": "What if you found your father?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. What then?", "input": "", "output": "What would you say?"}, {"instruction": "Exactly. Say I hired a detective agency--there's several around town--and gave them all I the information I have about my father, and they found him.", "input": "", "output": "Then what?"}, {"instruction": "That's what I'm asking you. Say I flew up to Alaska--or down to Caracas, or wherever the hell he is--and walked up to him and said, \"Hi, I'm your daughter.\" What would I do then? Hug him? Tell him how I missed him? Ask him why? Tissues?", "input": "", "output": "Here."}, {"instruction": "Why don't you keep these where someone can reach them? Surely people cry in here all the time.", "input": "", "output": "You're right, I should do that."}, {"instruction": "Goddamn it, Doctor Balis, why can't I get over this? I miss my father. Yeah, yeah, we've been through that. I keep running back into this like I'm stuck in a software loop.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe we should shift perspective on this just a little bit--what do you think this says about you?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? I don't follow you.", "input": "", "output": "I'm talking about the issue you have with your father leaving you, and the great amount of feeling that inspires in you. What do you think about yourself as a result of this?"}, {"instruction": "Think? Let's see. What does that say about me?  I couldn't get him to stay. He said he loved me, and he knew how much I loved him, but he left anyway. Well, that says a couple of things, doesn't it? It says I didn't love him enough. It says I wasn't good enough, that he thought something else would be better than staying with me. I didn't live up to his expectations somehow.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, let's take these one at a time..."}, {"instruction": "The same thing for Andrew, I guess. He went off to find adventure; clearly, I wasn't adventure enough for him...for either of them. If I was good enough, exciting enough, loving enough, they wouldn't have left me. Did I tell you Jake's taking me parasailing Friday?", "input": "", "output": "No, you didn't. Why did you mention that just now?"}, {"instruction": "It just popped into my head, I guess. So what?", "input": "", "output": "I just noticed that you talked about a lack of adventure and excitement in your previous relationship, and then immediately you mentioned another exciting adventure you're about to have with Jake."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, Jake's an exciting man, and we've been having a good time together. I'm loosening up, Doctor Balis, getting a life. Isn't that what you said I should do?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it is. And you've made a great deal of progress on that. But I want to point out a trend and see what you think about it."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "You've said that your father left to pursue his dream in far-off and exciting Alaska. Then Andrew left to find adventure. You said that you believe you lost them both because you weren't adventurous enough for them. Right so far?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Now you fall in love with Jake, and Jake likes adventure and excitement, too. So you're engaging in all these exciting and potentially dangerous activities with him. Is that really because you're enjoying life more and want to do these things? Or might it be that you're afraid of being too boring for Jake? That if you fail to be adventurous, another man will leave you."}, {"instruction": "Oh. Oh, wow. You know, I've never considered that. I have felt pretty apprehensive about some of this. Do you really think I'm...what's the term? Overcompensating? That this new life isn't about me, but about my fear of abandonment?", "input": "", "output": "What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "Boy, if that's true, then it's all just a fake. I'm just a fake. I'm trying to be someone I'm not, just to keep a man. What does that say about me? No, that's your line. I have to answer that, don't I? Okay, it says I'm a pathetic, man-hungry loser who can't stand to be alone. That I'm too weak to deal with rejection and will go to any lengths to hold onto a boyfriend--a boyfriend who may not even love me. Damn.", "input": "", "output": "I think you're being hard on yourself, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "You think? I wonder. I'll tell you what, though. That's not who I want to be. Strong, self-confident, self-sufficient--that's who I want to be. I want to be a woman who doesn't need a man around--a woman who just keeps one while it's convenient, because it's more fun with a man than without one.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I think you're taking this to the extreme in the other direction.  You've always struck me as a very strong, self-confidant, and self-sufficient woman.  That's not your problem.  You want to have a healthy relationship in your life. And in such a relationship, you can't take the other person for granted or keep him around as a matter of convenience.  That's not how you would like to be treated, is it?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Right. So...now I just have to...", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, do you really enjoy all these activities with Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Well, some of them. The hang gliding scared me shitless. Remember I told you how elated I was after we landed? Most of that was just happy to still be alive. I laughed myself silly after I busted my butt--the irony of it. I was just celebrating staying alive and in one piece, and I went and got hurt. But I really do want to parasail. It doesn't seem too dangerous. I don't have to do anything--the boat does all the work. And if anything goes wrong, I'm on a parachute already. I'll just glide down into the water. They don't even make you wear a helmet or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Just remember, you have the right to say no. If Jake invites you to do something that you're not comfortable with, just say no. Suggest something else. Or let him go alone. Maintain your sense of self, Katherine, you don't need to change for any one. If Jake is going to love you, it's better that he loves who you really are, rather than who you think he wants you to be."}, {"instruction": "You're right, of course. How long could I keep up the act, anyway?", "input": "", "output": "Exactly."}, {"instruction": "Hey, we did something today, didn't we? I think I made some headway.", "input": "", "output": "I think so. And that's our time for today. Can you make Wednesday again next week?"}, {"instruction": "I hope so, unless something comes up again. I'll do my best, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine. See you then."}, {"instruction": "Good night, Doctor Balis. Thank you...well, for what you do.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome, Katherine. I'm glad to do it. Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Sorry I couldn't make it last week.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. That's okay, though I'd appreciate as much notice as possible when you have to cancel."}, {"instruction": "That was as much notice as possible. But I'll keep that in mind. I talked to Frank about Lloyd Major.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "He appreciates my concerns but says not to worry. He told me that when Major gets to feeling antsy--like when he has nothing to do or like things aren't working for him--sometimes he picks a department, or two, or three, and tries to exert some control. Frank thinks he's just trying to feel like he has his hands on the reins. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "That's a theory. Has this changed the way you feel about him, and what he's been doing?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes, it has. I see him as less of an ogre and more...pathetic. He has to go around grasping at straws to feel like he's an effective CEO? That makes me think he's not an effective CEO. Though I have to admit we've done very well with him at the helm, and he did drop the Apple deal as soon as it became apparent we couldn't do it properly. I respect that; he could have really pushed things and made it hard on himself and the company, plus he would have lost a lot of points with the board.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "And Frank's giving me tips on how to deal with him. There's little tricks you can use to disarm him without him realizing, to let him believe he's in control. Most of it boils down to just kissing his ass, but if that's what it takes to keep him out of my hair and things running smoothly, that's fine with me. Lloyd, Frank, and I are to have lunch on Friday. I can practice some of these things then. I'm looking forward to it.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you'll be regaining a little control yourself."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I will. Feels good.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, are you setting yourself up in an adversarial position with Lloyd Major?"}, {"instruction": "Adversarial? No, quite the contrary. I'm letting him know I'm not his adversary, that I'm on his side, while keeping him off my back. If you have to hang a label on it, I guess my position would be a little defensive--I'm keeping control--autonomous control--of my department and keeping him at a distance. But no! God, Major is the last person I need in this company as an enemy.", "input": "", "output": "That's good to hear. How is the retirement going?"}, {"instruction": "So far, I'm still the only one who knows. I think Frank may bring that up at lunch this Friday.", "input": "", "output": "Good luck with that."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "No, that's it. See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "You're in a good mood today."}, {"instruction": "Why not? I'm getting it together, Doctor Balis. I'm getting control of my department, learning to properly play the politics so I can be an effective executive officer. I'm gaining control of my little neuroses--we haven't talked about that in a while, have we? I quit smoking--two a day wasn't an addiction, just a habit. In fact, I don't even watch both news shows any more. My routines have become so loose as to be almost normal now. I still make detailed lists--shopping lists, to-do lists--but I don't have to do the shopping only on Saturday morning. The bathroom gets cleaned when I get around to it, not Wednesdays at seven. I've even made a point of sitting in every seat at the sushi bar. Though...uh, I did notice that I had to try them sequentially.", "input": "", "output": "Well that sounds like quite a change, Katherine. Why the big difference?"}, {"instruction": "I think it's control. We identified control as my big issue, and I think I just feel more in control now. The job is coming together, I have a good boyfriend, things are smooth with Phil, and I'm getting my head together. You know, I think that's the big difference. All those things don't seem so important now that I realize that what I'm doing here is what's important. Did that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "Well, let me think.  The routines were to try to anchor you in a chaotic world--to give you a sense of control.  But now you can see that you're making progress in therapy--that you can gain more control through the understandings that you're coming to about yourself in here.  So you don't need the routines as much.  Does that sound about right?"}, {"instruction": "Exactly! So that's better. You know, you said something about not losing my sense of self in my relationship--not becoming someone else to keep Jake around. I thought about that and I noticed that I've been neglecting Phil in favor of Jake. I miss Phil. He didn't mind, of course. He was just happy that I was happy with Jake. But I missed him. So I'm trying to spend more time with him. I don't want to neglect Phil, you know? He's the one that's always there, no matter what's going on in my head. He always loves me, no matter what I'm doing or who I'm trying to be.", "input": "", "output": "That kind of unconditional love and support is important to have."}, {"instruction": "Yes, it is. So I want to stay close to him. And he needs it from me, too, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Certainly."}, {"instruction": "But Jake...hmm. He said he loved me, but not really.", "input": "", "output": "What did he mean by that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's not exactly what he said. He explained that the way I love him and the way he loves me are not the same. I love him with stars in my eyes, fireworks in my head, fairy tale happily-ever-after kind of love. He loves me with compassionate, caring, because-I-deserve-it kind of love. Like the way you love your brother, or your friend, or a cat. My love is possessive, he says, and his is free.", "input": "", "output": "That's an interesting perspective. What do you think of that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I've been giving it some thought, and it doesn't feel exactly true. Oh, what he said about my love is right on the money--I am in a fairy tale. But his part doesn't ring quite right. He is possessive; he's said himself that he doesn't want to share me. He calls me every day. We see each other several times a week. I know I'm more than a friend to him. I know I mean more to him than his family--although, from what I hear, his family is bunch of kooks and losers. But he does feel a little distant. It's like he does feel a lot for me--compassion and...um, caring, and tenderness. But he's not \"in love\" with me, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And of course, there's the sex. You don't sleep with your family and friends. At least, not usually.", "input": "", "output": "So do you believe he's deceiving you about being in love?"}, {"instruction": "Like lying? No, not exactly. I think he may be evading. Maybe he really is in love with me but for some reason can't admit it. Maybe it's too vulnerable a position for him. Maybe he's been hurt too much in the past.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe. But maybe he's not really in love. Maybe he's trying to spare your feelings."}, {"instruction": "Maybe. But I like it better my way.", "input": "", "output": "What evidence do you see to support your view?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, no man has ever treated me this well. He's kind, compassionate, patient. He listens to what I say. He shows me things I've never seen before, does things for me I've never done. He respects my feelings. When I feel like just holding, we just hold. When I'm feeling passionate, we're passionate. Although...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Just lately, the sex has gotten a little rough. He wants me to kneel in front of him to give him blow jobs. He spanks me. We do it doggy style. He hasn't asked to tie me up yet, but he's hinted at it. And he...well, he doesn't last as long. He reaches climax quicker now.", "input": "", "output": "Are you comfortable with this kind of sex play?"}, {"instruction": "Well...not really.", "input": "", "output": "Have you expressed this to him?"}, {"instruction": "Um...sort of. Not right out in so many words.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, do you remember what we said about maintaining your sense of self, not becoming someone else for the sake of the relationship?"}, {"instruction": "You're telling me to stand up for myself and not engage in activities I don't enjoy. Just like the thrill-seeking stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "You're right, of course. I should say no.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe it would be easier to bring this up sometime when you're not already engaged in sexual activity. Discuss it in a calmer setting, when you're less likely to be caught in the heat of the moment."}, {"instruction": "Like over dinner, in the middle of La Petite Chateau?", "input": "", "output": "You know what I mean."}, {"instruction": "Yes, of course I do. Oh, man, time's almost up and I didn't tell you the one thing I planned on.", "input": "", "output": "What was that?"}, {"instruction": "Jake wanted to go hang gliding again, and I told him no. He remembered my celebration when we landed, he thought that meant I was thrilled with the ride.  I had to explain what it was really about. He was very understanding. See, that's another reason I think he loves me--he wasn't insulted at all that I don't want to go again, he didn't mind. Whatever I want is fine with him. So we compromised--I'm going to watch, he's going to fly, and we'll have a picnic afterwards at the base of the cliffs with gliders painting the skies above us.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds very nice. Congratulations on standing up for yourself. And I'm glad he took it so well."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Me too.", "input": "", "output": "I think you can mark that down as more progress, Katherine. See you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And I'll make a deal with you--I'll make progress before then, too. I'll talk to him about the sex thing.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds good. Goodbye, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Here we are again.", "input": "", "output": "So we are. How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "Not too bad. Had lunch with Frank and Lloyd. Remember when I told you I wondered if Lloyd was on cocaine at the board meeting? I found out what that was about. He has a sinus condition; they're talking about surgery. Apparently Lloyd's not too wild about someone rooting around inside his face.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you discussed more than just business."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it was more of a get acquainted kind of thing. We spent all afternoon at Le Central, Lloyd and Frank getting lightly lit as the afternoon wore on. Frank more so than Lloyd; he's really loosening up, calming down in the past few months. Even the staff have commented on how much easier he is to get along with now. Unfortunately, I'm having to get tougher and more distant as I take on the role of a boss...well, of a bigger boss. I've always thought of the department as a sort of a family--organized that way, I mean. The CFO is a father: powerful, not to be crossed, kind of remote. The Assistant is a mother: passing along decisions, dealing with the day-to-day functions, more accessible. Of course, parents can't be playmates to their children, or there's no discipline. Now I'm moving into the father role, and I find myself just naturally distancing from the staff and putting Jeff into my old role. Um, where was I? Oh yeah, lunch. Lloyd mentioned he was impressed by how well I handled myself at the board meeting and during his recent audit. He really seems to respect me. Once they both got a few drinks in them, they admitted to hesitating hiring a woman but were now sure they had made the right decision after all. But when I tried to press them on this, they realized what they had said and clammed up. That's when Frank brought up his impending retirement.", "input": "", "output": "How did that go over?"}, {"instruction": "Not too bad. He said to Lloyd, \"Since we're on the topic, how would you like her to be CFO?\" And Lloyd looked suspicious and wary and said, \"What do you mean?\" So Frank explained that he intended to retire come the holidays and thought I'd be a great candidate to take his place--I already knew the company, the board, and had Lloyd's respect and all. So Lloyd looked at me and looked at Frank and said, \"Well, that's a possibility.\" And then I disappeared. It felt weird.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it was like I didn't need to be there any more--like I was watching from the sidelines. Fascinating, really. Lloyd tried to make the conversation about Frank's leaving, and Frank tried to make it about my taking over. Frank kept bringing up things I had done: reorganizing the department; revamping the retirement system; all the extra hours I'd put in handling the Apple proposal, sad though that turned out. Actually, I don't think he should have brought that up--you should have seen the anger in Lloyd's face when Frank said that. Anyway, Lloyd acknowledged all the good I'd done. But Lloyd kept trying to steer the conversation back to how much we'd all miss Frank, and would he change his mind about leaving, and did he have another offer on the table, and all that nonsense. It was like Lloyd was avoiding the issue.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what he was doing?"}, {"instruction": "Well, as I've said, he's pretty savvy. It could be that he's dead set against me taking the lead as the CFO and was trying to come up with a way to block it and preserve my feelings at the same time--so I'd stay and keep doing the bang-up job I'm doing now. It could be he really was more concerned with keeping Frank than with replacing him. Or it could be that he just didn't feel like thinking about it just then.  Who knows?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So what happens now?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I talked to Frank about it last week. He said he's going to have to start campaigning for me. Of course there'll be a formal search for a new CFO--all the usual stuff--and the board will make the final decision. Frank will campaign to Lloyd and to the board. But it turns out that my CFO deal isn't the sure thing I thought it was.", "input": "", "output": "You might not get the job?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I am the leading contender, though.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you'll stay on if they hire someone else?"}, {"instruction": "We'll see. I'll work for Lloyd if I agree with how he handles things. I can still retire at fifty, if I stay in this position until then. And I've been starting to wonder--why do I even want the top job? Sure, I don't mind the politics, and the meetings, and all the other time-wasting crap I'd have to put up with. And the money is good. If we manage to keep growing, avoid falling into the sinkhole of acquisitions Lloyd seems to want to make, I'll be downright rich. But what for? What good is money and prestige if my life's empty?", "input": "", "output": "Is your life empty?"}, {"instruction": "It's not full and satisfying, that's for sure. There is Phil and Jake, I suppose. But I've been chasing that corner office so long, it's like I forgot to do anything else on the way. Now that I have it--or almost have it--I realize that it's not what I want at all. Well, I mean it is but...shit, I don't know. I'm confused.", "input": "", "output": "Are you saying that you are not getting the satisfaction that you'd expected from your material success?"}, {"instruction": "Yes! That's it, exactly. Here I thought I'd be at the top of the world, but it's empty, you know? I try to congratulate myself on my success, and all I get back from inside is: \"Yeah, so what? Who are you? What are you in your heart and your soul?\" And the answer is, \"Nothing, really.\"", "input": "", "output": "Do you really believe that's true, Katherine?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. What do I have to show for thirty-one years of life? A fat wallet and a shiny car. A ne'er-do-well boyfriend to spend my money on. Did I mention that I pay for almost everything now? I can't remember how that started happening. One day, he was a little short. Another day, he bought dinner and I bought the tickets. Another time, I decided to take him out. Now that the nights are getting cooler, we're taking my car usually. Besides, I'm over the motorcycle--the thrill is gone, you know? So now he tells me where and when, and I pick him up and take him out. But god, he's so charming, you know? And there's definitely chemistry there. I can be mad at him and disgusted with myself over it all as long as he's not there. But as soon as I hear his voice or see his face, I just melt. I'll do everything he wants and feel good about it at the time--everything is just right as rain. Then later, I realize he's leading me around by--well, by my hormones, I guess--and lose all respect for myself.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, you deserve a lot of respect. You've achieved this level of career success because you're very intelligent, organized, and self-motivated. You've stood by your brother through thick and thin, supporting him all the way, and he obviously thinks a great deal of you. You've been trying to develop a lifestyle based on a strong set of morals and beliefs. Why, the very fact that you're seeking therapy is a proof that you have the insight to realize your own dissatisfaction and the will to do something about it."}, {"instruction": "Huh. Well...hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, you have a tendency to be very hard on yourself. You haven't made many mistakes in your career, have you?"}, {"instruction": "No, I haven't. Damn few. Work hard and think things through and you can avoid most mistakes.", "input": "", "output": "That may be true in the business world, but you're doing something much harder now. You're working to develop a whole new Katherine Lippard. And you're starting pretty much from scratch. Mistakes will be made; plans might not work out. You're dealing with people now and not numbers in the office. And people are much harder to predict than stocks and annuities."}, {"instruction": "Boy, you're right on that. Hmm...you know, you have to look past the corporate image, dig into a company's books--even it's managers--before you can make a good stock pick. This can take weeks of research: sometimes getting at the information that some people don't want you to see and finding out what the board really wants in spite of what the mission statement says. I guess people can be like that, too.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "You know what I mean, Doctor Balis. You brought it up.", "input": "", "output": "I'm interested in hearing how you work it out."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Sometimes a person is not who they seem to be. The image they project is just what they want people to see so they'll make an investment--like when I pretended to like danger and adventure so Jake will keep seeing me. But if you dig in deeper, get to know the person, you may find that it's a bad investment; they have no new products lines, no plans for expansion, no real vision. No matter now good they look to the public, the stock is going nowhere.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And this applies to Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Well, sort of, I guess. But I was thinking more of me. I have a great image--successful, in control, strong, and aggressive. But there's no sound plan, no reason to think that I haven't reached the top of the cycle, and my stock has nowhere to go.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I don't know about that. What are you doing here? Aren't you creating new product lines, planning for expansion, gaining vision? Wouldn't you be a great investment as a turn-around candidate?"}, {"instruction": "Damn, Doctor Balis. I didn't think you were following all that. Hmm, I guess I am. Hell, if Chrysler can turn around, I guess I can. Hey, that's another good analogy--you're my \"government bailout!\"", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I appreciate that, but I understand what you mean."}, {"instruction": "Oh, don't be insulted. The government bought Chrysler the time to make the necessary changes. So, I guess I need a new vision. You know, I'm more of a start-up than a turn-around. I'm not changing who I am, I'm building from scratch.", "input": "", "output": "Not entirely from scratch; you have a wealth of experience to draw on. How about a spin-off? You have one life--a business life--now you're making another."}, {"instruction": "Like Saturn from G.M. Different philosophies, but both very successful.", "input": "", "output": "Yes. I'm afraid our time is about up, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Huh. Damn, what a change. I have a new hope, Doctor Balis! But...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't get to talk about Jake like I wanted to. Can we take a few more minutes?", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid not. I have another patient waiting. But we can make another appointment if you want to come back before next Wednesday."}, {"instruction": "Um, I'll have to check my calendar. I'll call you.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Goodbye, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. How are you this week?"}, {"instruction": "Not too bad, really. Frank's been in an amazing mood. I caught him with his desk full of travel brochures, planning a honeymoon of all things! He has children by two women, his divorce's not even final yet, and now he's engaged already. You'd think he'd learn.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And he surprised me again--turns out Herald the Horrible is quite the romantic. He's talking about sailing the Mediterranean: Greece, Italy, France--all the real romance spots. Then maybe even Russia! And I saw Hong Kong written on his note pad, but that may have been an investment idea. And the rings! He showed me a catalog. Specifically, these ornate creations of filigreed white gold with inlaid diamonds. Of course he's a savvy investor, too; he can afford it. But I had the idea that he's rather tight.", "input": "", "output": "Clearly this is important to him."}, {"instruction": "Clearly. And you know, he really does seem happy? I don't just mean giddy and excited, but genuinely pleased and contented with life. Like everything is great, and he's getting all that he wanted.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like he is."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And I'm happy for him. I really am. It's just...I guess I'm jealous, too.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, here he is with all I want--top of his field, rich, ready to retire, free to do whatever he wants, and courageous enough to go ahead and do it with the woman he believes to be the love of his life beside him. I want that.", "input": "", "output": "It does sound ideal. It sounds like he's been working towards this a long time. Frank's a good bit older than you are, isn't he?"}, {"instruction": "Of course. He's about the age I want to retire at.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you can achieve all that by that age?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Probably. I'm almost at the top of my field. And as soon as I am, I'll be rich enough, too. In fact, if I play my cards right, I can move retirement up by as much as ten years. That is if I retire conservatively and not sail around the world with my third wife. Well, you know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "But free? I don't know. That's one thing that really appeals to me about Jake--he goes right off and does anything he wants, no regard for the consequences. Of course any money he has, he blows immediately. He's talking kayak lessons now--going to shoot the white water in a week or two. I'll watch from the sidelines, as usual.", "input": "", "output": "How are things going with Jake?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not through with the freedom thing yet. I admire Phil, too. He's rich when he sells a painting, destitute when he doesn't. But he's just as happy either way. He says things will work out however they're supposed to and there's no need to get uptight about it. Sometimes, I wonder if we grew up in the same family.", "input": "", "output": "You do seem very different."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I could learn a lot from Phil. You know, I did something healthy last week.", "input": "", "output": "What was that?"}, {"instruction": "Jake wanted me to watch him take his kayak lesson, but that bored me to tears. So I told him I had something else to do and spent the day with Phil. I just sat in his loft listening to folk music and watching him paint. It was very relaxing, very refreshing.", "input": "", "output": "Good for you. You took control of your life and did what made you feel good."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It was liberating. Like I was me--Katherine Lippard, an independent woman in my own right, not just Jake's girlfriend.", "input": "", "output": "Have you felt like that lately?"}, {"instruction": "Like Jake's girlfriend? Yeah, I have. I'm so torn, Doctor Balis. On one hand, he's amazingly charming and intelligent and attractive--a real catch. And he's good to me, for the most part. He gets a little macho and possessive sometimes, but that's just because he's so proud to be with me he wants to show me off. And he's great in bed. I mean, I've never felt so vibrant and alive and womanly. He can do things to me I've never even imagined. I've climaxed so much and so often that I've literally become dizzy. And that was just with his hands. When he...I'm sorry, I'm getting too graphic.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, Katherine, we're both adults. But I think I get the picture."}, {"instruction": "Oh, the picture! That's the latest thing. After I told him I didn't enjoy the S&M stuff, he started talking about taking pictures. And I'm a little intrigued. I've seen some very tasteful, artistic work done with nudes, and I know Jake knows the difference between art and pornography. And I have a nice body. But I don't want naked pictures of me displayed in the gallery or getting around. Some of Jake's friends are Phil's friends, and I'm not unknown in the art community around here.", "input": "", "output": "Then that's something to discuss before you pose for these pictures."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Boy, there sure is a lot of discussion in this relationship stuff, isn't there?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, there is."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "So are you getting what you want out of your relationship?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "You've said that Jake treats you well and the sex is good. What other satisfaction do you get from your relationship?"}, {"instruction": "What else should there be? He obviously cares for me, even if he can't say the \"L\" word. We have good conversations. We're comfortable together. He doesn't crowd me, and I try not to crowd him. It's just...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "The magic is gone. I'm not giddy for him any more. I'm not excited to see him. It's become commonplace. And he used to treat me like a queen, like it was an incredible honor to be out with me. Now it's like we take each other for granted. Hmm...", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Jake's switched music. He used to just listen to Counting Crows--over and over again, until I'd get sick of it. Now he's discovered Matchbox 20. This one album. Constantly. For a man who always has to be doing something different, trying something new, he sure fixates on his music. Anyway, I reminded myself of this one song that goes: \"I wanna push you around; I wanna push you down; I wanna take you for granted.\" I didn't like that. I thought it sounded controlling. But using another interpretation, he's saying that he wants the security of knowing that she'll always be around--of being able to take her for granted. And I guess that's okay.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel that sense of comfort and security with Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Um, mostly. I know he feels it with me. I still think there should be something else. I mean...I guess it's okay that the initial excitement has worn off. We're comfortable now. And he's good to me. And he's stimulating--in more ways than one.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "But nothing, I guess. Never mind.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I don't think you should ignore this. It's obvious you're feeling some dissatisfaction with Jake. You should find out what that's about before it poisons the relationship. If you can identify the problem, you can work on it."}, {"instruction": "Well, that's just it. I can't identify it. Maybe it's nothing.", "input": "", "output": "I doubt it. Let's take a break from it right now, but keep it in mind, okay? During the week and while you're out with Jake, keep this in mind and see if you can put into words what you feel is missing. We'll talk about it again next week."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Can't hurt to consider it, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Certainly not. Is anything else on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. My brother's birthday is coming up. And my mother's.", "input": "", "output": "Which brother?"}, {"instruction": "Joey. Phil was born February 29th, can you believe that? He says that's part of why he's so charmed. He also claims to be a very old soul--almost through the Earthly lessons and possibly on his last incarnation before moving on to another astral plane. And I have to admit, he does seem to have it all together.", "input": "", "output": "Yet you sound skeptical."}, {"instruction": "Well, you know, I've never put much stock in that kind of thing, but lately it seems to be making more sense. I can't deny that everything I've read about Aquarius is right on the mark for me, including the way I interact with Jake...ah...uh, Scorpio. But it still seems far fetched to believe that your personality is dependent on the position of the stars when you were born.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not a believer in astrology myself, but my understanding is that even the astrologers think that the personality traits described by the astrological signs don't apply.  I've heard it called \"newspaper astrology.\"  Astrologers think that you need to have a detailed chart of the position of the stars and planets when you were born--a natal chart--and that has to be interpreted.  So I wouldn't put too much stock in the generalizations about your astrological sign.  Hmm. I wasn't expecting to give a lecture about astrology today. What about the birthdays?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Joey and Mama want me and Phil to come back for their birthdays. I'm thinking I might go. Oh, no--I wonder if that conflicts with that corporate retreat in the Bahamas? I'm sending my number two man, but one of us should stay and run the show. Well, I can check on that.", "input": "", "output": "So you think you might go back to North Carolina to see your family?"}, {"instruction": "South Carolina. Yeah, I was thinking that might be a good time to talk to my mother about some of those things we discussed. You know? About Daddy, and how she felt about my relationship with him, and why she kept the college money secret, stuff like that.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like a good idea. Can you get enough time alone with her?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I'll take her out one night, just the two of us. Phil can go out with Joey and Rachel. He loves getting Rachel's goat, going to those upscale places she likes and acting all bohemian, watching her try to keep her composure while he mispronounces food and eats with his fingers and leans back in the chair waving his wine glass around. She's such an affected Southern lady that he swears he'll make her literally swoon one day.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like he has great fun. I guess everyone needs a hobby.  When will you be going?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, second week in October, I guess, then we can catch them both--10th and 13th. If I can get away from the office at all, that is. Yeah, it should be fun, despite it being with my family. I really like my little niece and nephew, you know? And they love Phil to death. I hope they grow up just like him.", "input": "", "output": "They could do a lot worse. Well, let me know if you're going to miss an appointment. And think about your dissatisfaction, okay? There may be something to that."}, {"instruction": "I will. Good night, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. Have you had a good week?"}, {"instruction": "Good enough, I guess. Frank says most of the board is on my side--on his side, really--backing the choice he made. So that looks good.", "input": "", "output": "That's good news. Must be a load off your mind."}, {"instruction": "Yes. It is.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? Then why are you frowning?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm still wondering if this is really what I want. But we'll cover that some other time.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What about your trip? Are you going to see your family?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I am. We're leaving the morning of the ninth, coming back on the fourteenth. I'll want to catch up at the office, so I'll miss the fifteenth.", "input": "", "output": "I'll make a note of it."}, {"instruction": "And I'm making a list of things to talk to my mother about.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a good idea. What do you have so far?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I haven't actually started yet. I know I want to ask about the money--why she kept the college funds secret. I mean I'm not mad, but I want to know her reasoning.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "And Daddy, of course. I'm not sure yet just how I want to approach that.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you'll come up with something. It sounds like you're giving this a lot of thought. Will you share your list with me when it's done?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I could use your input.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Speaking of thinking things through, have you come up with anything more concrete about what's missing in your relationship with Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, nice transition. You know, damnit, I can't really get anything concrete. I've thought about it a few times and I've watched my feelings while we were together. I still feel pretty good about him. I still enjoy spending time with him. He's nice to be with, and we have fun. And I'd rather spend time with Jake than not. The only thing I can come up with is that the magic is gone. God, that sounds so clich\u00e9. What I mean is the spark, the excitement when the phone rings, the tingly feeling when he looks at me. Could it just be that the newness has worn off?", "input": "", "output": "That's possible. I remember you saying that you felt the novelty had faded and you were settling into the long-term, comfortable part of the relationship. You seemed okay with it then. Has something changed?"}, {"instruction": "Did I say that? I thought you did. Well, either way...I'm not saying I'm uncomfortable. Quite the contrary, in fact. I kind of like it. I know he'll be there if I need him. I always have a date for the weekend. I don't have to go to functions unescorted. Jake fills a gap in my life that I've had for a long time. There's security in having a boyfriend--like knowing there's soup in the cupboard...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I've told you the good stuff--we have fun; he's supportive and comfortable. Sure, he can be pushy at times, and we don't share all the same interests. But he can't be perfect, can he?", "input": "", "output": "Yet you still feel something missing. The magic, the spark..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I wish I could put my finger on it.", "input": "", "output": "You may already have. What you're describing, is this a new feeling? Like there was something there before and now it's gone? Or has there always been something missing in your feelings for Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I'm not sure. I know I was so blinded at first by the excitement, the newness, that I couldn't see anything wrong at all. I couldn't even see the incompatibilities; I thought he was totally perfect. It could have been missing all the time, and I can just now see it. Or...are you saying that it's the newness, the initial excitement that I feel missing?", "input": "", "output": "It could be. Have you ever gotten past this point before in a relationship? Past the initial excitement and into the quiet, comfortable part?"}, {"instruction": "Ah, well, I don't think I've ever wanted to. I was headed that way with Andrew, but that was just a college thing--I wasn't looking for that to last years or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want your relationship with Jake to last a long time?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I would like to know that I could have a good, long-term relationship.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Katherine, are you still in love with Jake?"}, {"instruction": "That's a tough question. My first reaction is to say: \"Yes, of course I am.\" But as I think about it, I wonder.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, let's see. I trust him. I still don't have a problem telling him anything. His little habits don't really get on my nerves. I can forgive him all kinds of petty offenses, just because of how I feel about him. I do care about him--how he feels, whether he's happy. Although I won't sacrifice my happiness for his, I'd give my life for him. But then again, I'd do that for a lot of people--that's just how I am. I mean wouldn't you risk your life to save a drowning child? Even if it's a total stranger?", "input": "", "output": "I think many people would."}, {"instruction": "Of course. I'd throw myself in front of a bullet for Jake, but I'd probably do that for anyone I cared about. Does that mean I'm in love with everyone I feel anything for at all?", "input": "", "output": "We'll get to that in a minute. What else?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Okay. I don't get that giddy, schoolgirl anticipation when I think it's him on the phone or when I'm getting ready for our date. I'm much more matter-of-fact about it. I can look at him now without my heart filling up with affection. I can think about him without being overcome with desire. But he still doesn't get on my nerves, and I still look forward to seeing him. So what am I? Half in love?", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, let's talk about love for a while. Not Jake, just the feeling. It has been medically shown that a person who is \"in love\"--someone showing all the schoolgirl giddiness you've described--has a neurotransmitter profile very much like someone experiencing a psychotic episode. That is the brain chemicals produced by classic romantic love--the head-over-heels out of control and blinded by passion kind of feeling that you'd experienced at the beginning of this relationship--are the same chemicals and in the same proportions as those that cause psychosis. Are you following me so far?"}, {"instruction": "So you mean that a woman in love is clinically insane?", "input": "", "output": "No. There's a cause-and-effect difference. Psychosis is a purely physical problem caused by a chemical imbalance. In the case of love, the chemicals seem to be produced by the feeling. But the result is similar. You don't feel you have control of your thoughts and feelings, you view the world differently. This is why you are willing to ignore many negative impressions of your new lover, and why people get into relationships that are clearly bad for them. They are simply not processing the available evidence as they would under other circumstances."}, {"instruction": "Is this relationship bad for me?", "input": "", "output": "I didn't mean that at all. I'm merely trying to explain the difference in what you felt for Jake at the beginning and what you feel for him right now. You see, the psychosis-like love doesn't last. After a while, your brain simply can't support it for long--the neurotransmitter profile goes back to baseline, and reason takes over again."}, {"instruction": "As seems to be happening with me. So if that's all there is to love, and it fades that fast, how do people stay married and in love for a lifetime? Are they faking it?", "input": "", "output": "But that's not all there is to love. That's just the whirlwind, romantic love you see on TV and that you had with Jake in the beginning. Let's move to another love. Do you love Philip?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? Certainly.", "input": "", "output": "Describe that. How is it different from what you feel for Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I wouldn't sleep with my brother.", "input": "", "output": "Aside from that."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's comfortable. Caring. Compassionate. I'd give him anything I could, make him happy any way I could, just because that makes me feel good and just because he deserves it. It makes me happy to see him happy. Phil's one of those I'd take a bullet for, because I want to keep him safe. I'd rather see me hurt than him.", "input": "", "output": "How is that different from what you feel for Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's not, really. I care for Jake. I get pleasure from seeing him happy. I'd rather not see him hurt--that would hurt me. But I'm not sure how far I would go with that. I mean I want to take care of myself, too.", "input": "", "output": "And that's good. I sense you're doing a good job maintaining your sense of self, your individual identity with Jake."}, {"instruction": "I am. I'm proud of that. I'm glad you noticed.", "input": "", "output": "Good for you. So do you love Jake?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I do. Like I love Phil, but not as strong. Like I love children. But not like that psychosis thing, not like being in love. Oh no!", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Oh shit, Doctor Balis! I just realized this. I love Jake, but I'm not \"in love\" with him.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that alarming?"}, {"instruction": "That's just what he said to me. That was what I was so upset about a few weeks ago. Damn. So he was right. All this time I've been off my rocker, and he's been in this much more sober, mature mind set.", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't say you've been off your rocker. You've kept a remarkably cool head on your shoulders for the level of experience you've had so far. You've taken your time, watched what you were doing, and didn't get in over your head. And you watched what you were feeling--a skill many people never develop."}, {"instruction": "So I didn't do too bad?", "input": "", "output": "Not at all. You did well. You're still doing well."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. So what do I do about Jake?", "input": "", "output": "What do you want to do?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, I want that psychosis back. I kind of liked that.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you really want?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really. I want a mature, long-term, loving relationship with a man I can live with.", "input": "", "output": "Do you see that potential here?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe. I guess I don't know yet. There's still more to learn about him.", "input": "", "output": "Good. It can take months, even years to really get to know someone. But the payoff can be wonderful."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis? Have you ever been married?", "input": "", "output": "No, I haven't. Why do you ask?"}, {"instruction": "Then how do you know about the payoff?", "input": "", "output": "I've seen it a few times. I hope to get it myself some day. And that's all the time we have for today, Katherine. See you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. Day off?"}, {"instruction": "No. Frank and I spent the day going through old files trying to sort things out and figuring out what I would still need after he left and what we could toss. We tossed a lot. It's amazing what you save because you think you might need it later and then never do. Why, doesn't this look professional?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, yes, you look fine. I just don't think I've ever known you to wear pants to the office."}, {"instruction": "You're right, I don't usually. But we knew this would be a dusty job. Frank actually wore Chinos! With topsiders. I thought the most casual thing he owned was maybe double-knit and loafers.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I've been thinking I might go through some stuff at home the same way. So, let's get started.", "input": "", "output": "And that is?"}, {"instruction": "The list.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, things to talk to your mother about."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I thought I'd try to keep it to one page.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Let's hear it."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I thought I'd start light: chat about what's new with me and my job, find out what she's been up to, mention that I'd been trying new things--she always likes that. She doesn't want me to stagnate. I don't think I'll tell her about Jake.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? Why not?"}, {"instruction": "I might mention that I've been going out, but I don't want to get all into my feelings, and how serious this might be, and the possibility of grandchildren. Not until I know the answers.", "input": "", "output": "Still, Jake is a pretty big development in your life. Don't you think she'd like to hear about him?"}, {"instruction": "Of course she would. But you're a pretty big development in my life, and I don't want to talk about that, either. I just don't want to spend the whole night trying to defend my feelings, while she tells me I'm worrying over nothing and should just grow up and settle down.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you think would happen?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Now, on with the list. I'll say how lucky we all were to have the opportunity to go to college and how grateful I am the money was there. Then, I'll segue into: \"I've been wondering why you didn't tell us the money was there?\" Then, I can move from there into: \"I've had some other things on my mind...\" And then into the Daddy stuff. You look confused.", "input": "", "output": "More surprised. I just wasn't expecting such a detailed plan."}, {"instruction": "Well, there's plenty of room for improvisation.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that. So what is the \"Daddy stuff?\""}, {"instruction": "I'll say something like, \"You know, I really was devastated when Daddy left. But I was so wrapped in my own grief, that I never noticed what you were feeling.\" Then I'll get her to open up about that and describe just how she felt about him and why he really left.", "input": "", "output": "Didn't he explain to you why he left? To pursue his dream?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but that may not be all there was to it, you know? Maybe he never even wanted a family in the first place. Maybe he wasn't in love with Mama any more. Maybe he had cancer and didn't want us to watch him die. It could be a lot of things.", "input": "", "output": "Certainly. This might be a surprising question from your therapist, but if it did have something to do with your mother personally, do you really want to dredge that up?"}, {"instruction": "I think it's been long enough that she should be able to talk about it. Besides, I want to know. I don't think I'm ever going to be at peace with this until I have the whole story.", "input": "", "output": "But you have to be ready to find out that you already have the whole story. It could be that what he told you was the whole truth of the matter."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that might be. But right now, I don't know, do I?", "input": "", "output": "No. You don't. Is that the end of the list?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the list is more of a reminder of things I want to bring up, not an action plan. That's in my head. Where we get into talking about Daddy, it gets pretty loose. I want maximum flexibility there, because it might go anywhere.", "input": "", "output": "Good idea."}, {"instruction": "And I don't plan to have the list with me at dinner. Well, I might bring it along and maybe go to the bathroom once in a while to check it and make sure I'm not missing anything. But I don't want her to think I'm interrogating her from a script.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "So the items on the list are: \"Thanks for the college money. Why did you keep it secret? I sure felt bad when Daddy left, but I bet you felt worse. How did you feel, and did it have anything to do with me? While we're on the subject, did you ever feel jealous of my relationship with Daddy? Because sometimes I did, of yours. Did he tell you any more about why he left? Do you know why he stopped calling? Have you heard from him since then? Do you know if he's alive or dead?\"", "input": "", "output": "Here..."}, {"instruction": "No, I'll be okay. I have to be able to talk to her about this without crying, so I may as well practice now. I'll work into it more slowly, of course--give myself time to get ready for the questions and the answers. There, better?", "input": "", "output": "I'm always amazed at how you can do that."}, {"instruction": "Well, one day I'll be able to maintain this composure and not lose it even a little like I just did and then have to get it back.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe one day you'll allow yourself to lose it completely and actually experience your feelings."}, {"instruction": "I experience my feelings.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, every time you start to tear-up about your father, you throw some switch inside that turns it off and then you change the subject. You won't ever come to peace with this until you can work through the emotions connected with it."}, {"instruction": "Hey, I bawled my eyes out when I first told you about it and again the next time. Give it a little rest, huh? I don't want to lose it in front of my mother, or it'll turn into her just comforting me. She has to know I can handle the whole truth, or she won't tell me the whole truth. And I have to have the whole truth, or I'll spend the rest of my life wondering. Once I have that, I'll come in here and spill my guts, and you can watch me go through a week's worth of Kleenex. Is that's what you want? Okay?", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Oh, don't look so surprised. You knew I have this stubborn streak. Now let's talk about something else.", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "I let Jake take some portraits of me--with clothes on. Flattering stuff: tight jeans, a little ribbed sweater. I haven't seen them yet, but I liked the poses--not at all suggestive, just different views of the whole me. I'm thinking if I like them, I might try to duplicate them, but nude. Then we can see how different I look with and without clothes. Might even make a good exhibit--display them side by side.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And Philip's excited about the trip. He's just dying to see little Jeffrey and Lynn. And he's thinking up ways to get under Rachael's skin without being obvious about it. I swear, Phil gets along with everyone so well, it's strange to see all the venom he has for Rachael. But I don't think he hates her; it's just a game.", "input": "", "output": "And how do you feel about your brother's wife?"}, {"instruction": "She's okay, I guess. I mean she's a snob, but she was brought up that way. I feel a little sorry for her trapped in that image-is-everything mind set. And it's kind of sad that she can't leave Joey no matter how poorly he treats her. She just can't exist on her own.", "input": "", "output": "What about Joey?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, he knows a good thing when he sees it. But he's used to pushing limits. He takes advantage of her, does what he pleases knowing she won't leave him. But he's not really mean to her, he just gets away with what he can. He's not mean to her, but he's not nice to her either. I don't like that, but part of it's her fault. She lets him get away with it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But the kids are great. I haven't seen them in a while. I hope they're still as sweet and wonderful as they were. Somehow, they seem to be growing up okay despite their parents. Maybe private schools and summer camps do more for them than I thought.", "input": "", "output": "Children can be very resilient."}, {"instruction": "I hope so.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really. I guess it'd be okay to end a little early, wouldn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Sure. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hi! Sorry about the time--I was tying up some loose ends. I wanted to make sure no decisions would have to be made while we were all gone.", "input": "", "output": "While who's all gone?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm going to Columbia tomorrow, and Frank and Jeff are both leaving for the retreat in the Bahamas on Sunday. That leaves the department rudderless for Monday and Tuesday of next week. But they should be fine. I'm actually thinking of not replacing Jeff after I promote him to my assistant. We don't need so many accountants. We've been effectively running short for weeks--while Frank's been handing over the reigns--and everything's been getting done.", "input": "", "output": "So you've been confirmed as the new CFO?"}, {"instruction": "The board meets in early November, but Frank thinks I'm a shoo-in.", "input": "", "output": "Good. So are you excited about your trip?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. I'm surprised at how excited I am. I've been thinking--I actually get along with my family fairly well. We don't agree on a lot of things, but I like my mother all right. I can't think of why I hold all this resentment towards her--she didn't treat me that bad. Maybe it's just left over from our competition for Daddy's love. I've realized that I blame her for his leaving, at least some.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that is?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't figured that out yet. But I expect all that to come together starting Friday night.", "input": "", "output": "That's when you plan to question your mother?"}, {"instruction": "You make it sound like an interrogation. It's more of a fact-finding mission. I'm not looking to lay any blame, I just want to get all the information so I can come to grips with this thing. That's the other thing that's got me so excited--I can see the end of my turmoil about my father.", "input": "", "output": "How is that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, once I get all the answers, I figure everything will click into place. I can decide how I feel about everything that happened, probably stop blaming myself. I'll come in here, tell you the whole story, and have a good cry like you keep wanting me to--I'll start letting it go. I realized that I've been holding onto my father all these years, never really coming to grips with the idea that he was gone forever. I think as soon as I have all the facts and can think about it from that basis--not having to fill in the gaps or wonder about things--I can really accept it, deal with it, and then get over it. I've been a hurt little girl long enough, Doctor Balis. I'm ready to grow up now and get on with my life.", "input": "", "output": "Very good, Katherine. I'm glad to hear that. As you know, I'm not a big believer in suppressing feelings, and I'm very encouraged that you realize you have to work through your feelings to get past them."}, {"instruction": "I am too.", "input": "", "output": "But I have to caution you again--your mother may not have all the answers you're looking for, and the answers she does have may not provide all the clarity you want. You may still have mixed feelings, and they won't just dry up and fade away as soon as you start to confront them--there'll be a period of grief. Getting these answers is the beginning of the process, not the cure."}, {"instruction": "Oh, Doctor Balis. It's like we've changed roles. No, we've changed polarity. I used to be all cautious, afraid to confront anything, and you encouraged me to go out, get a life, and face my feelings. Now, I'm doing that with a vengeance, and you're pulling me back.", "input": "", "output": "I'm merely encouraging moderation and trying..."}, {"instruction": "Yes, yes--trying not to get my hopes up for a fast cure so I won't be disappointed when it takes a long time. I do remember our first few sessions, you know. Wow, what was that? Six months ago? But yes, I know we'll still have work to do when I get back.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "But that's not the only reason I'm excited about this trip. Do you know I haven't had a real vacation since I started at SII in 94? I've taken some days off--long weekends and stuff--and I've seen my family, but I don't think I've taken a solid week off since I moved here. I have weeks of vacation time accrued. I'm thinking of taking off again before Frank leaves. That's officially December 31, by the way, right in the middle of the fiscal year. But he'll be gone by Thanksgiving for all practical purposes. Hell, he's almost gone now! But what was I talking about?", "input": "", "output": "Taking a vacation."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. It's too cold to go to Alaska now, but I could take a Caribbean cruise, or visit Hawaii, or maybe dance the Tango in Cancun...or the Cucaracha, or whatever it is they dance there. But it feels good just to get out of the office for a while, to know that they'll get by without me for a few days. It's like I'm not tied down, you know? Like I have freedom to balance my responsibilities.", "input": "", "output": "That's important."}, {"instruction": "And I feel like I have it all together. My house is in order: nothing in the refrigerator that'll go bad while I'm gone, everything's clean, plants are watered, shopping's done, laundry's done. And the office is in order: no projects are in the works, bills are paid, payroll is in early, calls are returned. I won't have to think about anything this weekend but enjoying my family and getting my head on straight.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "This must be what it feels like to be Philip--no responsibilities, no deadlines, just doing what makes you feel good and enjoying life. I'll have to talk to him about that on the plane.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm glad to see you're so ready, Katherine. I hope you enjoy your visit."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. So I'll see you..um, the 22nd? Two weeks from today, anyway. Enjoy your day off from me next week!", "input": "", "output": "Have a good trip, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I wish I could say it was good to be back.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? What's wrong?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I misspoke. It's not bad. Just the same stuff again. Sometimes a vacation gives you a new attitude so life doesn't seem so drab when you get back, but sometimes the vacation just somehow fails to do that.", "input": "", "output": "Your life seems drab?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, no more than usual. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate my life. Sometimes, I have a real good time. But I think I did mention a general feeling of dissatisfaction. I was hoping it would just go away.", "input": "", "output": "I think you're going to have to make that happen yourself."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I don't know what I expected.  Magic, maybe. That things would somehow look different after a week away. Oh, well. You know, it wasn't a real vacation anyway; I was with my family, after all.", "input": "", "output": "And how did that go?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, pretty well. Phil and I had a great conversation on the plane, we caught up on all kinds of things. He's going to be rich again soon.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he got a contract with UCSF for a mural in the athletic building. He was sketching it out on the plane. It's a huge enterprise--ten feet high and forty long--depicting all the sports the college is involved in. He's got until after the Christmas break to finish it, and it pays almost as much as he made all this year. He says it's a compromise to his \"real art,\" but he has to pay the bills. And he asked me for investment advice! I think little brother may be coming to earth and realizing that he has to plan for the future.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? And how do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "Um, it's nice to know he has some financial sense. I don't want to see him die poor. And I'd rather he didn't freeze to death when the winds come off the bay and through his walls this winter. But that's not what you meant, is it?", "input": "", "output": "No, I was..."}, {"instruction": "Wait, I think I can get this. You remember me saying how I admire Phil for living by the seat of his pants, not knowing where his next meal is coming from, and yet being happy all the time, rich or poor. He's not worried about money or getting ahead. And now he's moving away from that mentality and towards mine. You think I may be disappointed?", "input": "", "output": "Something like that."}, {"instruction": "Ha! Someday, I won't need you anymore, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "That's the plan. So what about it?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't the lifestyle I admired, it was the attitude. Phil could enjoy everything, no matter what happened. But I don't think he's changing his mentality, just his behavior. I still think I can learn from him. In fact, I did a little during this trip. The trip--it's the real topic of the day, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "As always, the topic is whatever you feel you need to discuss."}, {"instruction": "I guess I'll tell you more of what happened. Rachael threw Joey a big party at their house and invited all the local glitterati. I didn't know Joey was such a big shot. The mayor came by, and two or three state senators, and some judges, and someone from the attorney general's office, and of course lawyers and socialites from four counties. And Rachael spent the evening dropping names of all the people who couldn't make it, right up to the governor himself, though Joey admitted to me that they'd never met. I got so caught up in all the ego tripping going on that by the end of the party, I was introducing myself as, \"the CFO of a major computer company in San Francisco.\" I have three cards from name partners who want to expand their work to the West Coast. As if the company doesn't have a legal department.", "input": "", "output": "Did you enjoy yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I did. I've been in the corporate culture long enough that I can fit in pretty well with that kind of crowd. But you know what? I can fit in with the artsy crowd too, and I like them better--more real, more colorful, much less concerned with how others view them. Which brings me to Philip.", "input": "", "output": "What about him?"}, {"instruction": "He loved the party. He found an empty serving tray and walked around with it like it was a paper plate, putting canapes and drinks and big Dagwood sandwiches on it. Once, he picked up a whole bunch of grapes and bit them right off the bunch, one by one. Poor Rachael went pale at that one. But the hotshots loved him! He was so colorful--a real bohemian, just like they've seen on TV. He always had a bunch of them in stitches. I think they felt like they were connected to the common man somehow, talking to a real living artist from San Francisco. And he can be a real charmer when he wants to. I think he could have had half the women there, married or not.", "input": "", "output": "He does seem to know how to enjoy whatever situation he's in."}, {"instruction": "You said it. I want to be Phil Lippard when I grow up.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Was your mother there?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. And Rachael even made a couple of toasts to her. Everyone paid their respects to Joey's mother in truest Southern manner. Then she and her boyfriend left early.", "input": "", "output": "Boyfriend?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she's been seeing this man Gary for years. He owns an upscale clothing store, does pretty well. But they're both comfortable just dating perpetually.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So the party finally broke up, and we three kids stayed up until dawn, just talking and catching up on everything. I don't spend enough time with my family. You know, Joey may be rich and important and all, but I still love him. I mean, of course I love him--he's my brother. But I like him, too, you know? He's an okay guy. He knows his wife is stuck up and hard to get along with, but he listed several things that make her okay. And he loves her in his own way. Not that it stops him from sleeping around sometimes and staying away occasionally, because she can be hard to live with. And he doesn't respect me just for what I've accomplished, but he does for what I am. Of course, he's proud of my position, but he's more glad that I'm strong and self-sufficient and straightforward and...well, all the things you talk about that make me a good person.", "input": "", "output": "He likes you for you, not for your position."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And I like him for him, in spite of his position. And Phil...well, Phil loves everyone, and everyone loves Phil. That's just part of being Phil.", "input": "", "output": "So you had a good visit."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It was good to see Joey again, and more so to have the three of us together.", "input": "", "output": "Doesn't Joey have children?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, Jeff and Lynn. We took them out Sunday--just them and Uncle Phil and Aunt Kathy. They've built a nice park, since we moved away, with a stream and a pond and wide open spaces--great for kite-flying. Jeff is wild and free, like Phil, but with a success-driven streak like Joey. But Lynn is kind of a snot. I'm afraid she's growing up like her mother. But she can't always pull it off. We got her to smile in spite of herself a few times, and her brother's a good influence on her. She might be okay.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "And Mama had a barbecue Sunday night--excuse me, a cookout. Barbecue is shredded pig in a sauce. We just cooked a meal outside on the grill--that's a cookout. I'm getting too citified. So it was the whole extended family including Rachael but without Gary. And Rachael loosened up. Take her out of the hoity-toity and she's almost a regular person. She even ate barbecue chicken with her fingers and was just a little mad when Jeff and Joey had a--excuse me, Jeff and Phil--had a belching contest.", "input": "", "output": "So your sister-in-law isn't the snob you thought she was?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, she is, but only to impress people. Which makes her a fake, which I still can't respect.", "input": "", "output": "A fake? But don't you change your behavior to fit the company you're in? Does that make you a fake?"}, {"instruction": "No, because I'm not trying to impress anyone. I'm just using diplomacy to get along.", "input": "", "output": "I suspect she would say the same thing."}, {"instruction": "Maybe. But seeing this side of her, I don't hate her as much. And I have more hope that the kids will turn out all right.", "input": "", "output": "You can help by setting a good example."}, {"instruction": "Like making a success of my life rather than just my career? Like being true to myself rather than being what will get me ahead? Like hanging out with the people I like better, rather than the people it's politic to be seen with?", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "See? I've been listening to you.", "input": "", "output": "I knew you had."}, {"instruction": "Speaking of people I like better, Jake was glad to see me come back. He said he missed me.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And I think he meant it. He was much more loving, paying attention to me, stroking my hair. He didn't talk about himself at all, seemed actually interested in my trip and my family. And the sex was more tender than it's been in weeks--more like making love than the exciting passion we've been having. All that stuff is fun, in and of itself, but it doesn't make a bond, you know? Our lovemaking has been more bonding, more enjoying each other's company and each other's selves, than the sex we've been having recently. I think he's realizing what a good thing he has in me, and is beginning to appreciate me for who I am.", "input": "", "output": "That's good."}, {"instruction": "I hope so.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm not sure yet. But our time's about up, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "You mean our time?  Yes, I guess it is. See you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Um, never mind. Next time. Good night.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor Balis. How have you been?", "input": "", "output": "Fine, thank you. What about you?"}, {"instruction": "Not too bad. The board meets tomorrow to confirm me as CFO. Unless someone decides to raise a big stink, it's just a formality. Frank gets to give his input. Lloyd does, too. I don't expect Lloyd to be too overjoyed, but then again, he's not likely to be satisfied with anyone. Besides, they don't have another qualified candidate. The search was perfunctory--just for form's sake.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "So how do you feel about this?"}, {"instruction": "Good. I feel good. It's the culmination of my career, I've hit the top--stock options, corner office, executive perks, thinking more than doing, being creative. Yeah, I think the creative thing is what's going to be the best about it.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So what about your personal life? How are things at home?"}, {"instruction": "At home? Um, organized. You know, things weren't as bad as I expected when I got back to the office. I had left it in pretty good shape, and Jeff knows his job. So even though he wasn't there for part of the time, things got done. I just had a little mail to answer, a few loose ends to tie down, and the office was running like a clock again. So that wasn't as bad as I expected. And I've been getting things at the house back in shape--fall cleaning, really sprucing up the place.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "I've been shopping, restocking, and giving everything a real thorough cleaning. I even rented a steam cleaner for the carpets. It's amazing how much grime can still be in there even after vacuuming every week. And I'm thinking about painting.", "input": "", "output": "Why is there this frenzy of activity?"}, {"instruction": "Um...well, I think I'm bored, really. Work hasn't been too engaging, and I can't see Jake every night. So I've been slipping back into my routines a little.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, is there anything else on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "I know I seem a little scatter-brained today. Sorry.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine?"}, {"instruction": "Yes?", "input": "", "output": "Am I going to have to drag it out of you?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. No. I just have to get up the nerve.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "She told him to stop calling.", "input": "", "output": "Your mother? Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I've been trying to understand it, trying not to be mad about it. And I can, really--I really can understand her logic. She said she was disturbed at how upset I'd get every time daddy would call or send a letter. It took me days to recover--I'd just mope around, cry sometimes, feel sorry for myself for a while, until I got over it. Then in a week, or two, or a month, he'd call again, and I'd go through the whole thing again. She said she thought I'd never get over him as long as he kept calling and stirring it all up over and over again. So she asked him to stop calling. So I could heal, she said.", "input": "", "output": "I understand her logic even if I don't agree with her conclusion."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It is logical. But I can't help but be mad about it. I mean he was my father, for Christ's sake. She knew how much I loved him. She knew how I cared about him and how important it was for me to hear from him. And she fucking told him to leave me alone, to drop out of his daughter's life altogether...well, of all the kids. He was the most important thing in my life, and I had a chance to keep him there--a little at least--and she took even that.", "input": "", "output": "So you're angry."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Except I don't think I should be. Mama's never been mean to me--never to any of us. I know she did what she thought was the best thing for me, and I kind of agree with it, you know? If I had been in her shoes, I may have made the same decision.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, don't invalidate your own emotions. Feelings aren't right or wrong and don't always have to be justified. Give yourself permission to simply feel what you feel, honestly. No one can say what you should feel in this situation. You feel the way you do. Period."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't just feel one way or the other. I feel them both. On the one hand, I think she took away my last link to my father--the most important person in my life--and I'm mad as hell about it. And on the other hand, I can understand why she did and forgive her for it. But the forgiveness doesn't stop the anger.", "input": "", "output": "You shouldn't expect it to. The anger is something you're going to have to experience on it's own terms and to work through in due course. You have an excellent head start--recognizing your mixed feelings. This is much more than you were capable of when you started therapy just a few months ago."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Thanks. So are you saying it's okay to be mad at my mother even though it doesn't feel justified in light of the circumstances?", "input": "", "output": "Do you need my permission?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently so! I asked, didn't I?", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I can tell you all day that it's okay to experience your emotions, but it doesn't really mean anything unless you tell it to yourself."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, all right. So I'm mad. We'll table the question of whether that's okay or not for the time being. So what do I do with it?", "input": "", "output": "For now, just allow it. Don't tell yourself it's not proper, just let it come of its own accord and see where it leads you."}, {"instruction": "It wants to lead me into a confrontation with my mother.", "input": "", "output": "Does she know how you feel about this?"}, {"instruction": "No. I tried to keep it real factual, to keep my emotions out of it. I thought I'd get more reliable information that way.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I remember you explaining that plan to me."}, {"instruction": "So I didn't say anything then, and afterward I just couldn't decide exactly what my feelings were on the matter. Do you think I should tell her?", "input": "", "output": "Do you think it would help you resolve your feelings?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I think it would make her feel bad, and I don't want that. Is it really fair to blame her for decisions made a lifetime ago? She felt bad about it at the time, I don't want to stir all that up again now when it can't possibly do any good. All it's likely to do is make her feel bad, and we've all had enough of that already.", "input": "", "output": "I appreciate your compassion for your mother, but you have to consider what being unable to resolve this is doing to you, too."}, {"instruction": "I am, I am. It's a cost-benefit analysis, right? Will my venting at her make me feel enough better to justify her feeling worse? I don't think so. I think I can get over this without doing that. I can vent at you, if that's what I need.", "input": "", "output": "Fair enough. Did I understand you to say that your mother felt bad about it at the time?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I used your trick and said, \"And how did that make you feel?\" She opened right up. She agonized over this decision, considered how it would feel to me to think my father had just abandoned me, and decided it wouldn't be as bad in the long run as what it was doing to me at the time. I guess she got that one wrong, hmm?", "input": "", "output": "Well, the long-term effects of abandonment can be much more significant than the short-term traumas you were experiencing. She didn't allow you any closure with your father, no chance to come to terms with the reality of the separation."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, she wasn't a psychiatrist, was she?", "input": "", "output": "No, of course not. Did she get you any counseling at the time?"}, {"instruction": "No. Mama was raising us to be strong and independent, remember? Besides, it was twenty years ago. Seeing a shrink in the 70s wasn't widely accepted. There was a stigma attached, which I'm sure Mama didn't want us kids to have.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, yes."}, {"instruction": "Still...", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "You know, I find myself defending her decisions even though I don't agree with them. She just made mistakes, that's all. But they were mistakes that fucked me up all the way here--all the way to what should be the pinnacle of my life. I would have liked to have known that my Daddy still loved me, you know? That he cared, and he wanted to see me. I would have liked to visit him and to have him at my graduation and to be able to call him next week and tell him I've made it--I'm the CFO. And I would have liked to know that he was proud of me. Here I go again, goddamn it, feeling sorry for myself over something I can't possibly change.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, it's perfectly normal to feel grief at such a significant loss. You weren't able to come to terms with it when it happened, you've been suppressing it for almost twenty years. And even now--when you are starting to feel it--you're invalidating your emotions and trying to shut them off. You're not going to get over feeling sorry for yourself until you allow yourself to feel sorry for yourself. Just as you're not going to get over your anger at your mother for the mistakes she made until you actually feel that anger as it comes--unadulterated. Katherine, stop judging your feelings and just accept them, experience them. I've seen you do it a little already. You can recognize what you're feeling, express it, even explain it. You can come in here and talk about it. But I don't think you're allowing yourself to really experience it. You've never gone all the way though the grief process naturally associated with the loss of your father. You're stuck in it, and that's why it keeps coming up so strong and feeling so uncomfortable."}, {"instruction": "I'm stuck in the grief.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "Because I won't get into the grief.", "input": "", "output": "Because you cut it short and don't let yourself go through it."}, {"instruction": "So next time when I get to feel this way, I should just go with it.", "input": "", "output": "If you're in a safe place, yes."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, it wouldn't do to get into that at work, would it?", "input": "", "output": "No, but it would be fine here or with Phil or Jake."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know about Jake. But I understand what you're saying. I don't like it. I can't promise to do it. But I understand.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good start. We're about out of time. Are you okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah, I'll be fine. Look...uh, if I do get all into these feelings and it gets to be a bit much, can I call you?", "input": "", "output": "Certainly. Just call the office number, the service can always find me."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thanks. Good night, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hi. Do you like jazz?", "input": "", "output": "A little. I'm guess I'm more into classical music."}, {"instruction": "I haven't heard any good jazz in a long time. Jake listens to that one album all the time--it's tonic now--and Phil's into acoustic. So I was hanging around the house last night--nothing to do--and I decided to put on some jazz. Old favorites: Desmond, Coltrane, Brubeck. I lit some candles and sat back. Then it occurred to me that I'd like a nice, relaxing bath. So I took some burgundy to the bath, put in some oils, and lit more candles, and just soaked in the dark to jazz piano and saxophone.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds nice."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it was amazingly relaxing. I'd forgotten how nice it is to just enjoy the simple things in life and let the rest of it go. I came to work today feeling better than I have in weeks. And I still feel it. I'll have to do this more often.", "input": "", "output": "There's a good jazz club in the East Bay--a place called Yoshi's.  They've got live music several nights a week.  And there's probably some good clubs in the city. I can't think of any right now, but I'll try them for you if you like."}, {"instruction": "That'd be great! Go to some cramped little room, smoke cigarettes, drink gin, sit back and just let the music soak into me...yeah, I want to do that. Will you go with me?", "input": "", "output": "Well, you know I..."}, {"instruction": "Relax, I wasn't serious. It wouldn't do to mix your work and social life, would it? Still, if you weren't treating me, I think we could be friends.", "input": "", "output": "I think so too."}, {"instruction": "So while I was in the tub, approaching Blue Note Nirvana, I got to thinking about some things we said last week.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Like how I never really got to come to terms with Daddy leaving, and how I don't allow myself to experience my grief.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "I think I'm starting to understand why Daddy had to go. When we talked and in the letters he wrote, he told me how great it was where he was, how wonderful he felt pursuing his dream. I began to understand that he wanted us to come with him and that Mama wouldn't do it. I suspect that part of the reason why she told him to stop calling is that he was talking about me maybe coming to live with him. Well, I brought it up. But I was definitely going to visit. So what I think is that you were right--if we had continued to communicate, I would have realized that he hadn't deserted me and that it wasn't about me at all. He just had to pursue his dream, and he was trying to have it both ways--keep in touch with the family and go after what made him complete. But when he stopped calling, that solidified it in my mind that he had deserted us. And I began to think that everything he had said--about me coming up there and him not wanting to lose contact with us--was just a lie. It's the old \"actions speak louder than words\" syndrome, you know? He said he wanted to stay in touch, but then he didn't.", "input": "", "output": "So you no longer believe he deserted you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure. I don't want to believe that, that's for sure. But again, I'm torn. I have evidence both ways. On the one hand, he said these things, and I want to believe them. On the other hand, he let himself be bullied into losing all contact with me. And--here's the big one--if he really wanted to keep in touch, he could have gotten in touch with me later, when Mama couldn't stop him any more. He could have sent me a damn card for graduation or just a note after I turned eighteen or something. But he never did.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did your family move?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "After he stopped calling, did your mother move the family to another address?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. We got the apartment...no, we were in the apartment the last time I heard from him. We got the house--I don't know--a few years later, before high school, anyway. And Mama moved again after all the kids left. Why?", "input": "", "output": "It could be as simple as he didn't have your new address."}, {"instruction": "We were in the book. And I've been listed ever since I've been on my own.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Of course, now that you mention it, once I left Columbia...no, he still could have called my mother and found out where I was. Oh, well. I still think I may try to track him down.", "input": "", "output": "How would you do that?"}, {"instruction": "Private detective. I have the money.", "input": "", "output": "Oh yes, I remember."}, {"instruction": "I haven't decided for sure yet. So I was in the tub, thinking all these things, and I asked myself, \"How do I feel about Mama now?\" And the answer is I'm still mad. Only now, I have another reason, too. She purposefully kept me from visiting my father and maybe moving to Alaska with him. I didn't get to choose between them, she decided for me. Oh, I can hear the arguments: moving a child too much would be bad for her; the schools wouldn't be as good; the conditions are too hard; he'd be gone too much; a child should be with her mother. And that's all legitimate. But I didn't even get the option. And I'm mad that she made me think he deserted me. And I'm mad that she chose divorce over moving--she decided to split the family up and make us poor.", "input": "", "output": "You said yourself that he didn't have any money after he moved. And it sounds like your father wanted to be in the wilderness in Alaska, where it would have been very hard to raise a family."}, {"instruction": "Hey, who's side are you on, anyway?", "input": "", "output": "I'm your advocate as always, Katherine. But I'm asking you to see all sides of the picture. In this case, your mother might have been right. Divorce may have seemed like the better option. Look at the education you got, the success all the children made of themselves. Are you sure you could have done that well in the wilds of Alaska?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, okay. You're right on this one. I can see how that may have been the better choice. But I can still be mad about it, can't I?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, certainly. Your mother made some poor decisions, but maybe she made some sound ones, too. But you were hurt. It's reasonable to be angry about those things. Let me ask you, did your mother ever discuss these things with you as they were happening?"}, {"instruction": "No. Absolutely not.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ask?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't allowed. Mama was sort of a despot. No one ever crossed Mama, or there was hell to pay. Not even Daddy. Maybe that's part of why he left.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of hell?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, she never beat us. I mean there were spankings sometimes when we really deserved it, but she wasn't abusive. No, it was more the yelling, the sulking, the...uh, putting herself down. She would say things like, \"You should know better than that, I'm such a bad parent--I didn't teach you that.\" Which of course made me feel like such a bad child because I hadn't learned it, because I knew she was the best parent you could ask for. Or she'd yell and yell and yell, making you feel just awful and worthless. No, Mama didn't have to hit us--she had words.", "input": "", "output": "Words can hurt just as badly as beatings, and the wounds can last longer."}, {"instruction": "Tell me about it. What brought that up? Oh, yeah, we never talked about Daddy leaving after he left or about him not calling. I couldn't ask, I knew she didn't want to talk about it. And she made him out to be the bad guy--he left, he stopped calling, and that's all there was to it. Of course she wouldn't tell me that she sent him away and told him to stop calling. I guess it was easier to let me believe my father had deserted me than to admit that she had something to do with it. She could do no wrong. I guess I can add that to my list of things to be mad at her about.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Huh. Look...uh, I'm through with this topic for now, okay? I don't want to get all hot and raving about it.", "input": "", "output": "This is the perfect place to do just that, if you need to."}, {"instruction": "I know. But I don't want to, okay? I don't like it when I do that. It feels...it feels out of control. That's scary. I think I just want to be mad a little at a time, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Fair enough. Do you have anything else that you'd specifically like to talk about today?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah...um, I did. Just a minute, I'll come up with it. You hate to see me shut my emotions down, don't you? Well, I'm not doing that this time. I'm going to stay angry just as long as I am angry, okay? I'm just not letting it get out of control.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Good."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, I remember. It was about dealing with the grief--the grief at the loss of my father is something different from all this other stuff about desertion or Mama's splitting us up. It's just the normal grief process following a loss, right?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it can be like that--just the loss, not the circumstances."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, it's been a long time since freshman Psychology. I remember there being steps: denial, desperation, acceptance...uh, blame.--something like that. Do you remember them?", "input": "", "output": "I think it's denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. This process is most often associated with death. The survivor denies the death, refusing to believe it, sometimes gets angry at the loved one for dying, bargains--usually with God--for a return,\texperiences depression as the realization sets in that the death really has occurred and is irrevocable, and finally accepts the death. Not everyone experiences each stage. And sometimes, two or more stages can occur simultaneously. The first three stages often occur very quickly, but the depression can last for some time."}, {"instruction": "Did you ever teach?", "input": "", "output": "Why do you ask?"}, {"instruction": "You just gave me a college lecture on the subject. You even changed--you got all clinical, in some kind of professor mode. I think you'd be a good teacher.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you.  I taught a bit as a psychiatric resident, but it wasn't my avocation."}, {"instruction": "So, stages. Well, I never could deny it--he was gone, simple as that. Although I did used to pray that he'd come back or that I could go there to be with him. That's your bargaining. Anger? I guess I'm in that now, although I'm not mad at Daddy.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "We're almost out of time, but I want to talk about that next time. Think about whether you have any anger toward your father for leaving."}, {"instruction": "Homework, eh, professor? Okay. Maybe I'll do it in the bath. But I want to finish with this grief thing before I go. We covered denial, bargaining, anger. What's next--depression? I guess you could say I've been depressed about it for twenty years. Is that normal?", "input": "", "output": "That's longer than usual, but it strikes me that this is the first opportunity you've had to really explore this loss. You certainly didn't get any support from your mother."}, {"instruction": "No. And I knew I was supposed to be strong and bear everything silently. That's what Mama taught us. You don't get ahead being all emotional.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. But you stay behind by suppressing your emotions. We can work through your depression here, Katherine. The way you approach your therapy, it shouldn't take too long."}, {"instruction": "Good. Good. I'd like to be through with this.", "input": "", "output": "Well, our time is up for today. See you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. Uh, do you know if Alex is coming today?", "input": "", "output": "No, not today. Is something wrong?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, not really. I just wanted to apologize for slighting him last time I passed by. And I like him, he seems like a nice kid. Has he changed his time?", "input": "", "output": "You know I can't discuss my other patients...well, maybe that's a bit too strict an application of my rule.  He just cancelled today, but he'll be back next week, I think."}, {"instruction": "Oh, okay. Thanks, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hi. Okay, let's hit it. One: the board met yesterday and confirmed my appointment as the Chief Financial Officer of Silicon Impressions, Inc, a Fortune 1000 company. They also reaffirmed our intention to become a Fortune 500 company and charged me with much responsibility in that regard. My appointment becomes effective January one, the start of the next fiscal quarter.", "input": "", "output": "Congratulations!"}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Frank will be on the payroll until December thirty-one, but basically he'll be persona absentia after Thanksgiving. He's pretty much cleaned out his office, introduced me to all his contacts, briefed me on how to treat every board member--I have a notebook on each individual's quirks and pet peeves. I have Jeff set to move into the assistant's job, and I'm leaving one accountant's position open for now. There's only one little snag.", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "Some of the staff think Jeff is gay. So he may have a problem exerting his authority.", "input": "", "output": "More so than you did being a woman?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Good point. And there's always a rough period when a new boss takes over, particularly when he's promoted from the ranks and then has to supervise the people he used to work beside. There can be resentment.", "input": "", "output": "Are there other accountants who wanted the job?"}, {"instruction": "Well, most of them applied for it, of course. Fortunately, Jeff is senior to all but one, and that one doesn't have the education. And I interviewed some outside applicants, but they all fell short.", "input": "", "output": "So Jeff is clearly the most qualified and senior of the applicants?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Then there shouldn't be too much resentment. Is he gay?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I didn't ask. I don't really care. I'll back him up if there's dissension in the ranks, and my authority is well established. So, moving along. Two: Phil is loving his assignment at the college. He's started already, and the thing he's most excited about? He gets to use scaffolding. He says he feels like Leonardo da Vinci painting the Sistine Chapel. I'm going to go this weekend and watch him work. It's good to see him so engrossed in something he loves and to see him make a living at it. If this goes well, there may be other contracts, and he could have a more reliable income. You may soon see original Lippards all over town.", "input": "", "output": "I'll be looking for them."}, {"instruction": "Three: Jake continues to be adventurous. He's talking about snow-boarding this winter, which sounds like a good time, actually. I need to take a vacation, so I'm thinking we'll go north, or to Colorado maybe, for a week in January. I'll take lessons, and Jake will do his macho posturing thing, and we'll see who gets hurt first. I'll ski, of course; snow-boarding looks like the very edge of disaster. But that's the way Jake likes it.", "input": "", "output": "Are you really interested in skiing?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I've always thought I'd like to learn. And some ski lodge, far from civilization with nothing but majestic mountain peaks wherever you look, seems like a great vacation. Outdoor exercise in the daytime, romantic fires at night, and no contact with work for a solid week. I'm looking forward to it.", "input": "", "output": "So you and Jake are doing well?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's been good. We've settled into a real comfortable relationship. It's not going anywhere at the moment, but we're both okay with that. We've decided to enjoy what we have, to set no goals so there'll be no pressure, and to see what develops. Of course nothing may develop, but then again, maybe we'll decide later on that we want to spend the rest of our lives together. We'll see what comes up.", "input": "", "output": "If you both really feel that way, that sounds like a healthy attitude."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Do you find yourself being able to open up to Jake?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "I remember that you've had some hesitation to reveal to Jake some details of your life and your feelings. I got the impression that you didn't trust him with the full depth of your emotions."}, {"instruction": "You caught that, huh? Well, you're right, I don't always trust Jake with everything about me. I don't know that he can handle the extent of my neuroses or deal with the strength of some of my feelings. And frankly, I'm a bit embarrassed about what I'm going through with my father. I don't want Jake to think I'm a fragile neurotic who can't get over some disappointment twenty years ago. I'd like to be stronger than that.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What are you afraid will happen if Jake learns of what you're going through regarding your father?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I'm afraid he won't respect me as much. But I don't think he'd leave.", "input": "", "output": "Is his respect a serious issue between you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he has to know I'm a strong and self-sufficient woman. That's a big part of why he's with me, he's told me so. He likes that I'll take charge sometimes, that I'm not one of these \"oh, whatever you want to do\" kind of women. And ordinarily, I'm not. There's just this one issue I get all weepy about, and the whole rest of me is what he thinks it is. And I'll be through this soon, anyway, so why blow his image of me when that image is, for the most part, correct?", "input": "", "output": "I think it's important to be able to share all of your feelings and concerns with someone you love--to let him see a more complete picture, so he can know the whole you and know that he loves that part, too."}, {"instruction": "You asshole! Do you have an answer to everything?", "input": "", "output": "I've been a psychiatrist for some time. Katherine, Jake may develop more respect for you if he sees that you have a vulnerable, feeling side, too--if he sees that you're not afraid to confront your demons, that you're not afraid to cry. And he may find you more accessible and therefore easier to love."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I don't know. Jake's not that good with feelings either, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Well, you know him better than I do. But can you really have a long-term relationship with a man if you can't trust him with your true feelings?"}, {"instruction": "Look, I'm not convinced that this is a long-term thing yet. You said yourself it can take many months to get to know someone well enough to make that determination. I'm getting to know him. I have to hold something back, okay? I'm not going to give everything up just yet.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Fair enough."}, {"instruction": "Okay. So. That's the update on my life, my present life anyway. It's time to move on to the pressing issue of the day.", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "I did my homework as assigned, Professor. You told me to think about whether I was angry at my father at all. I am, a little. I'm mad at him for leaving in the first place. When he decided to have kids, he made the commitment to be there until they were all grown up. I hardly think eleven years old qualifies. And I'm mad at him for allowing my mother to keep us apart. And I'm mad at him for not getting back in touch with me after I was eighteen and could decide these things for myself.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. And what are you doing with all this?"}, {"instruction": "I was planning just to feel it, like you said. But what's strange is that I know I'm angry about all these things, but I just can't work myself up into a rage about them. It's more like I'm just a little peeved, not really pissed off. Annoyed, maybe. It's a legitimate anger, and I feel like it's justified. But it's just not as strong as I expected.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like your anger should be more intense than it is?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if \"should\" is the right word. I did expect it to be more intense than it is. It's just...well, the more I think about it, the less it seems to matter. I mean there could be a perfectly good explanation for all these things, even if all it is that he just couldn't stand up to my mother. I can certainly understand that! Maybe he was weak, maybe he cracked under the constant Mama onslaught, maybe he just made some bad decisions. Whatever it is, I can't hold a grudge for the rest of the man's life or, more importantly, for the rest of mine.", "input": "", "output": "You can't?"}, {"instruction": "No! I can't. And I don't want to. Sure I'm mad, but that happened so long ago. And I know for a fact that he really didn't want to hurt me. I really do believe that he would have prevented that if he could. I think I could forgive him. In fact, I think I have. And forgiveness is a big part of healing, right?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it is. You've come to these conclusions just since last week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I spent a lot of time on it. I thought about it almost every night. Plus, I got to talk to Phil about it some. It's like I'm doing therapy by myself now, every night. It's hard to get things done, you know--chores and stuff, after the sun goes down--and since it's getting dark earlier, I get more down time. I use that time to think about what we've talked about. Things seem much clearer in the night, don't you think? One of Jake's poems says something about that. Hold on. \"Truth hides behind the rational activity of day, is revealed in night's quiet darkness,\" something like that. So when it gets dark, I sit back and ponder on what we've covered. You said everyone needs a hobby? I guess this is mine.", "input": "", "output": "I'm impressed. Few people devote much time to therapy outside of this office."}, {"instruction": "Maybe you should assign more homework.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe I should."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, so...I guess I don't harbor much resentment for my Daddy. I'd still like to talk to him, though, to know that he's happy, to tell him what I've been doing, to make him proud of me. So I'm looking for a private detective.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure you want to do this?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I think I have to settle it all in my mind. I just want to tell him I made it, and that I still love him, and I don't resent him for what he did. Because, you know, it occurred to me he might think I hate him now, after all that's happened. And I want to tell him I hope he's happy and I wish him the best.", "input": "", "output": "Are you prepared for what you might find? He might not even be alive, or the trail could be so cold that he's impossible to locate."}, {"instruction": "I know. I'm ready for that. If he's dead, I'll visit his grave and talk to him there. If he can't be found...well, that would be disappointing. But at least I'll know I tried. And of course it could be that he's just not interested in hearing from me.", "input": "", "output": "That could be."}, {"instruction": "Well, that would hurt. Yeah. But I should hope he's mature enough to deal with his long-lost daughter looking him up, only because of the love in her heart. But if not...well again, at least I'll know I tried. But whatever happens, I feel like I have to get it settled in my head.  I need to know what happened to him, where he went, who he is, and at least try to make a connection. Otherwise, it's still open like an unsolved case. It never ends.", "input": "", "output": "You're looking for closure."}, {"instruction": "Exactly. I was afraid you'd think this was a bad idea.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I have my reservations, but it sounds like you've thought it through. I hope there's a happy ending. Our time is up for today, Katherine. Would you like some more homework?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think that's a good idea.", "input": "", "output": "Fine. You've given your anger with your father a lot of thought and decided you can forgive him. Work on your mother this week, okay? No goal in mind, just analyze your feelings, experience them without censoring, and see where it takes you. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thank you, Doctor Balis. You've been an amazing help to me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to do it, Katherine. Good night.  See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. It was a pretty good week. Work is work, Jake is Jake. Phil is ecstatic, which I guess is just another way of saying, \"Phil is Phil.\" So how is Mrs. Balis and the little Balis children?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry?"}, {"instruction": "Just a stupid joke. I've noticed that I always come in with an update on my life, some meaningless chatter before I get to the heart of the matter. Today, it just sounded even more trite and meaningless. I wonder why I waste time like that? I'm doing it right now, in fact.", "input": "", "output": "It can be hard to get started sometimes. If you need to ease your way into it, that's fine."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. That sounds right. I don't want to get into the heavy stuff, so I stall. Which...shit, I guess I'm still doing. Okay. Here goes. My homework was to think about my feelings towards my mother-- about Daddy's leaving and her telling him to abandon me. Well, they're pretty strong.", "input": "", "output": "Whenever you're ready."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'm a little mad at Daddy for letting himself be pushed into breaking all contact, but like I said, I can understand that. I guess it was he who left in the first place, but that's another discussion; I'm getting off track already. I was trying to say that while I'm only a little mad at Daddy and can start to forgive him, I'm supremely pissed at my mother. Daddy left and all, but he wasn't going to split with me entirely; it was Mama who caused that. It was she who made me think--who made an eleven year old girl think--she had been abandoned by the one person who meant the most to her. I've realized that it was Mama who caused all this pain I've been carrying around for two decades. And I'm pissed! Damn! That fucking bitch! I could have gotten over this years ago. I could have had a Daddy all this time, could have grown up knowing what it was to have a father who loves you, and...shit.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Katherine, go ahead. Here're the tissues."}, {"instruction": "Goddamn it, Balis, I wanted a father! I wanted Daddy. And that self-righteous, know-it-all, controlling bitch cut him off. Damn! You wanted emotion? Here it is, Doctor, in all my pitiful glory.", "input": "", "output": "I don't find anything pitiful about it at all, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well. What else can I do? You know what I want to do? I want to take a baseball bat to this place, that's what. I'm so fucking angry that I can see myself just beating the shit out of anything nearby. But I can't, can I? So it builds up, fills me up with no place to go, so I cry.", "input": "", "output": "You can beat up that pillow if you..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, fuck you and your cheap psychiatrist tricks! If it won't break, it's no good and you know it. It's better yet if I can get hurt, too.", "input": "", "output": "Where are you going?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, relax. I'm not looking for something to bust. I just have to move around a bit. Is that okay with you?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "Good, because I'm doing it anyway. I've had this rage coming, Doctor Balis. I deserve it, and I'm damn well going to enjoy it. That bitch! You know, when she told me what she'd done, my first instinct was to stand up and shout, \"You did what?\" Then I wanted to snatch her lying throat out. But no, I wanted to get the whole story, to come to grips with this at last. I'm amazed that she didn't see the fury in my eyes; I must be a damn good actress. And I'm glad I did. I don't know if I'll ever be able to face her again without snatching her bald-headed or something. But I...what the hell are you grinning at?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry. I've just never heard that expression before. Please go on."}, {"instruction": "Quack. I managed to keep a straight face when my mother dropped this bombshell on me, at least you could try to do the same.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine? Why are you attacking me?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not, damn it. I just...oh, hell. I'm sorry, okay? This isn't about you, you know that.", "input": "", "output": "Of course I do. But maybe you should sit down again, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, okay.", "input": "", "output": "Take a minute to compose yourself. We'll go on whenever you're ready."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thanks. Where did those tissues go?", "input": "", "output": "They're on the couch."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.  Okay. I'm better now.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Now, was all that anger directed at your mother?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't think it was all anger.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "You know how weepy I get over my father. Some of it was that, I think. The old grief I haven't finished with yet. It got mixed up in there and...I don't know.  Amplified it somehow.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. But there was a good deal of anger there in the first place, right?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, I said that.", "input": "", "output": "Was it all for your mother?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I'm not following you, Doctor Balis. What are you driving at?", "input": "", "output": "Could some of that anger have been directed at your father?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? No, I told you about that. Where have you been? I'm mad at my father, sure, but he did what he could to stay in touch. He doesn't hold most of the...of the culpability. He wasn't the one who hurt me, at least not primarily.", "input": "", "output": "But he did hurt you. He was the one who left in the first place."}, {"instruction": "Sure, we've been over this. Why are you...oh, I see. You don't think I'm letting my father share in the blame or in the anger.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, your reaction to your mother is quite violent, even though you've said that you don't think she meant to hurt you, that you think she just made a poor decision. But it's your father who actually left. And then when your mother cut him off from you, he made no further attempt to contact you even years later. So why do you think you harbor so much more resentment toward your mother than your father?"}, {"instruction": "Well, maybe it's a time thing. I've had twenty years to be mad at Daddy. I don't know, I'm tired of it now, maybe. I've just found out about what Mama did. It's fresher, maybe.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you ever remember being angry at your father?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah. I guess. Hmm. You know, now that I think of it, I don't think I ever really was. I was sad, downright broken-hearted. Well, sure, I was mad. He told me he loved me, then he left...oh, hell. Balis, I don't know. I'm all in a jumble right now. Damn, and I thought I had this all worked out.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, Katherine. Fits and starts, remember?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. I guess today was a fit, right? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get nuts.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay. This is a safe zone, Katherine, I won't be offended by your behavior. But I will expect you to replace anything you break."}, {"instruction": "Okay, that's a deal. But I think I can control myself in the future.", "input": "", "output": "Fine."}, {"instruction": "Look, I'm worn out. Can we call it a day?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, that's fine. See you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Well, are you going to be here? It is the day before Thanksgiving.", "input": "", "output": "I'm flying out to see my family that night, but I'll keep my Wednesday appointments."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'll be here, I guess. Have a nice weekend.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks.  Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Happy Thanksgiving.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Katherine. Same to you."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Listen, I was thinking--after I left here last week, I got to feeling kind of embarrassed at how I acted. But then I thought, \"No, I'm supposed to do that stuff.\" That's kind of the point, right?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Katherine, that's just right. This process works best if you can feel free to experience and express whatever you're feeling. Here in the office, the normal rules of protocol are suspended so you can do just that."}, {"instruction": "With the exception of replacing whatever I break.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'd rather you didn't break anything, but if it should come to that, yes."}, {"instruction": "Deal.", "input": "", "output": "So what's on your mind this week?"}, {"instruction": "Thanksgiving. And Christmas.", "input": "", "output": "What about them?"}, {"instruction": "Old family memories--daddy mangling the hell out of some poor turkey, little bits flying off the electric knife; hanging construction-paper decorations we made in school; the time we strung popcorn and cranberries, eating as we did it even though the popcorn was stale and the cranberries sour. We hung it on a little pine tree outside, and the birds ate it. That was beautiful--flocks of little birds all over the yard and the tree, flittering hither and yon. I even remember Daddy teaching me what \"hither and yon\" meant while we watched. Then they all shat pink for days because of the cranberries, and the walk and Daddy's car were just a mess! And I remember when Daddy had to be away one Christmas, and we were sad. But Mama kept us busy and joyful until he got back three days after Christmas, and we had it then, because we had saved it for him. I remember Mama wanted an artificial tree, but Daddy wouldn't hear of it. He insisted we get a real one every year, then he lectured us all about fire safety and keeping it watered. I can remember the smell...I can smell it right now. There were always a few needles that got stuck in the carpet, and it was absolute hell to get them out. And cookies...Mama baked all kinds of cookies for Christmas, and the house smelled just incredible. I walked into a bakery last weekend, and it smelled like that. That's what got all this started in my head. There were Chris Chickies, and Sour Cream Softies, and gingerbread snowmen, and those stamps in the shape of Santa Claus and Christmas trees--we decorated them with sprinkles and icing. I expect a package of those in a few weeks. Mama's been sending us all some every year since we moved away. Except Joey, of course; he's still in town. Phil just gets a cup of tea and sits down and eats them all at once. But I save mine, just have a few every day, so they last for weeks. That's how it was when we were kids--there were cookies for weeks. Mama would make huge batches, and we weren't allowed to have more than a few at a time--can't spoil your appetite, you know.", "input": "", "output": "No, certainly not. It sounds like you have some pretty nice memories of your childhood Christmas times."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah, I do. Sometimes I think that seeing a psychiatrist, I should have some horrendous tales of childhood abuse to relate, but it wasn't like that. Mama and Daddy loved us, they took care of us, they were never mean. Certainly, they never beat us. Daddy never even raised his voice to me, not to any of us. Not that I can remember.", "input": "", "output": "What about your mother?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Mama was a different story, though it wasn't that bad before Daddy left. In fact, when he was gone on business, she was extra nice to us, made sure there was always harmony while he was away. But she could still yell sometimes. Of course, the yelling wasn't the worst. I told you about how she would make us feel useless, and stupid, and guilty, didn't I?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you did."}, {"instruction": "Damn, how did I get on this? I was remembering happy stuff. Oh, well, anyway. It seems like it got worse after Daddy left. Or maybe it was just because we were getting older, I don't know. Maybe we were getting less afraid of her, so she had to step up the level of terror.", "input": "", "output": "Did you feel terrorized by your mother?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? No, no, that was...uh, just a bad choice of words. You know how you build up resistance to a drug, so it takes a stronger and stronger dose to get the same effect? It was like that, I think.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Or maybe it was just that she didn't have Daddy's calming influence any more. You know, in the beginning, she was sympathetic to me after Daddy left, but after a while, I think she lost patience with it...with me. Finally, she was just barking at me to snap out of it, get over it. He was gone and that was that, and I'd better just learn to live with it. Hey...she cut me off from that, too. I was doing the whole grief thing, being sad about it, and she made me stop. Damn. Like I need another reason to be mad at her.", "input": "", "output": "So you weren't allowed to experience your sadness, work your way through it at your own pace?"}, {"instruction": "Right. And I got no sympathy for it. Well, only a little.", "input": "", "output": "How long were you allowed to grieve?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. He called for a couple of months, then stopped, then...I don't know, four months? Maybe five.", "input": "", "output": "So your father kept in contact for two months. Then after three more months of no contact, your mother told you to stop grieving, is that right?"}, {"instruction": "Close as I can come. Is that enough? I mean, what's the average?", "input": "", "output": "Well, it varies. It's hard to say just how long someone should grieve; the only correct answer is until it's over. Obviously in your case, it was not long enough."}, {"instruction": "You still didn't answer me. How long, usually, for this sort of thing?", "input": "", "output": "It's not unusual for more than a year to pass before a child comes to grips with the loss of a parent."}, {"instruction": "A year. So I've been shortchanged seven to nine months of grieving.", "input": "", "output": "You could look at it that way. Alternately, the grief has been on hold since then--still there, but not allowed to surface because you were still held by your mother's command."}, {"instruction": "Held? Well, I guess so. I mean, I believed her. She said I should be over it, so I believed her. Hmm...I don't think I could just start grieving again and be over it seven months from now. I think the time for that has passed; I've missed the window of opportunity.", "input": "", "output": "Not necessarily. I think you're in an excellent place to do just that."}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "You're much more mature now--independent and able to make your own decisions and judgments. You have the whole picture, you have perspective, and most importantly, you're in therapy. What an excellent opportunity to experience your loss, talk about it, feel it without judgment, and work through it."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. You're right. You've said yourself I do therapy really well; I should be able to put this behind me in no time.", "input": "", "output": "I agree."}, {"instruction": "So...um, how do I start? Well, I've started already, of course. So what's next?", "input": "", "output": "I think you should reconsider how much responsibility your father shares in all this."}, {"instruction": "I thought you might say that. I noticed last time you wanted me to be madder at him.", "input": "", "output": "I don't want you to be anything, Katherine. But I do think he shares in the responsibility for causing an eleven year old girl a great deal of sorrow. Hmm...okay, homework. I want you..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, come on, Professor! Homework over the Thanksgiving break?", "input": "", "output": "I know, I'm an ogre. I want you to consider your father's part in this with an open mind. And see if you think he may indeed share some responsibility."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Are you going to see your family this weekend?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I'm leaving tonight. What about you?"}, {"instruction": "No. Mama asked, but we were just up for the birthdays. Jake and I are cooking seafood at my house. He doesn't like his family much, either.", "input": "", "output": "Well, have a good time."}, {"instruction": "I anticipate a very quiet two days, full of laziness and lovemaking.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds good. See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Enjoy New York. Happy Thanksgiving.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. You too."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Did you have a good holiday?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, thank you. How about you?"}, {"instruction": "It was just as I anticipated. We lazed around all day, watching football, drinking spiked eggnog, and eating turkey sandwiches that Jake brought from the deli. Then it was Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9 with the cheese, Beaujolais Nouveau with the Lobster Newburg, cognac with the chocolates, and a hangover the next morning. By the way, did you know that orgasms are an excellent hangover cure? Have one immediately, repeat as needed. It's better than chewing aspirin, and there's no awful taste in your mouth.", "input": "", "output": "I'll keep that in mind."}, {"instruction": "So how do you like your new cat?", "input": "", "output": "How did you know I got a cat?"}, {"instruction": "It's all over your tie. I can't help but notice those ties, they're kind of...uh, noticeable. But the last two times, you've had cat hair on them. If you ever stood up, I'll bet your pants are covered.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, she's very affectionate. It's been a learning experience."}, {"instruction": "I'll bet. Hey, how old is Alex? Eighteen, twenty?", "input": "", "output": "Younger. Why?"}, {"instruction": "I met his roommate. I guess I should start at the beginning. I took him over to meet Phil last Wednesday, and we had supper. I know Alex is an artist--that's how we met--and I thought he and Phil would get along. And they did, they hit it off real well. I was afraid Alex might be attracted to me, but it became apparent at supper that he's gay. He had some doe eyes for Phil, but poor Philip's just oblivious to these things. Women do the same thing, and I don't think he notices at all. So after supper, I took Alex home and I met his roommate Ralph. He's at least twice Alex's age and apparently is well off. And I started to wonder just what the situation is there. I know Alex has trouble at home, and I wonder if he's being Ralph's little boy-toy just for a place to live. Not that it's any of my business, I know.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What are your feelings toward Alex?"}, {"instruction": "I thought about that myself. He's cute and all, but he's way too young for me. And of course he's gay. I guess I feel kind of maternal. You know, since Philip's all grown up, I don't have anyone to take care of any more.", "input": "", "output": "Is that important to you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I have thought about having kids. I think I may have something to offer the next generation. But I wonder if I'd be a good parent. And. of course. I'd have to pick the father very carefully; I want my kids to grow up with two parents there all the time. I'd be pretty pissed if my husband left halfway through raising his children.", "input": "", "output": "Like your father did."}, {"instruction": "Yes, damn you, like my father did. Of course you'd bring that up.", "input": "", "output": "It does fit, doesn't it?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, okay. Oh, I got to meet his mother, too--Lorraine. Good Southern name. She's a bit of a bitch, though. She had some harsh words for both of us. And the way she looked at me, I got the feeling she was ready to eat me alive. Something else, too: she seemed familiar. But I think I'd remember having met this woman before.", "input": "", "output": "She made an impression on you, huh?"}, {"instruction": "Have you met her? You can't answer, I know. Well, if you have, then you know how...what a forceful personality she has.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, enough of this. It must make you uncomfortable to have one patient talking about another.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay. I can keep pretty clear boundaries. Though my patients do seem to have a knack for running into each other."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, I guess you get a lot of business from SII. I know the contract you have with CalaCare. Some of them must know each other from work.", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess I've done my chit-chat for the day. It's time to turn in my homework.", "input": "", "output": "Something wrong?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I just don't want to admit it. You were right. When I said I'd be mad at my husband if he left halfway through raising the kids...my father did that, and I am mad at him. I was shortchanged, you know? He made a promise. When you have kids, you know that you'll have to dedicate your life to raising them, until they're ready to go out on their own. He didn't do that; he broke his promise. But you seem to think I should be just as mad at him as I am at my mother, and I don't think that's right. See, even though he left, he tried to keep his promise as much as he could. He called, he was going to visit, he might have let me move up there with him. It was Mama who cut him off, who forced him to break his promise totally instead of just halfway. So I feel justified in being more angry with her than with him. I guess if it was all him, I'd be mad all at him. As it was, he was trying to take care of himself and still to take care of us, too. So I could be half as mad. But Mama cut him off, so I feel like it's two thirds her fault. So I'm twice as mad at her as at him. Did you follow that?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but my math comes out differently. Listen to this reasoning: he left on his own, your mother didn't kick him out. So all the fault would be his. Then she cut him off, so she shares in the fault. It seems to me like that makes it closer to 50-50."}, {"instruction": "Oh, but she does share in his leaving. We could have gone with him, it was Mama who said she wasn't moving the family and made him go alone. So it was 50-50 until she cut him off. Now it's much more hers.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Well, let's table that for now. So you realize that some of your anger is directed at your father?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah. But it's hard to be mad at him, you know? When I think of Daddy, mostly I'm just sad. I feel the loss, but not the blame. I know you don't want to hear this, but I think mostly I'm over it--being mad, I mean. He did what he felt he had to do, and I can understand that. At least he tried to live up to his promises, as much as he could. I just...I'm tired, Doctor Balis. I'm tired of carrying this burden around. I don't want to be angry, I don't want to be sad. I just want to get over it.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. Carrying such a weight of emotion around can be quite draining."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, exactly. And I feel better about it, I really do. This has been good for me. All this talking has been...uh, damn, I can't find the word. When you talk about something and it feels good just to get it off your chest, just the release is a relief...what am I talking about?", "input": "", "output": "Catharsis?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah! All this has been cathartic--just getting it out in the open. And you've really made me consider just what my feelings are, so I can see it so much more clearly. Just that has been a relief. Things are sort of falling into place on their own.", "input": "", "output": "You've done a lot of hard work here, Katherine, and made some real discoveries about yourself and your feelings. I'm glad you feel that it's helping."}, {"instruction": "I do. It is.", "input": "", "output": "So what do you feel about your father now?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Okay, I'm a little mad at him. He made a promise, a pretty big one, and he broke it. But people change, and priorities change, and I can see where he's coming from. It doesn't excuse what he did, but I can understand it. We don't always make good decisions. So I can forgive him and get over being mad.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "I'm still sad about losing him, but I guess I may always be. It doesn't make me cry anymore. Well, you know, I miss him; I'd still like to have had a Daddy. I'd like to have one now. So I am sad, and I do miss him. I guess that's the grief process, right?", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "Seven more months, right?", "input": "", "output": "However long it takes, Katherine. Don't cut yourself off at some arbitrary date."}, {"instruction": "Like my mother did, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "What about your mother?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, man, Doctor Balis, do we have to get into this now?", "input": "", "output": "If you don't feel up to it, you don't have to do anything. But we have the time, and as long as we're on the subject..."}, {"instruction": "You're right, of course. I'm just tired. This can be real work sometimes. My mother. I'm pretty mad at her, and that's fresh, because I just learned about her part of it just recently. So I may be awhile getting over that. But I thought of something over the weekend. As Jake was soaping me up in the shower--of all times--I felt kind of bad that my mind wasn't on...uh, what was going on. Maybe it wasn't all about me. Maybe it just hurt her too much to be reminded of him all the time. Maybe she had to cut me off so she could cut herself off, so she could start getting over it. If that's the case, I sort of pity her for that. Sometimes, I forget that she loved him, too. I mean, I could see it whenever they were together; she was so totally in love. I think I described that to you.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I believe you did."}, {"instruction": "So maybe I can get over being mad at her, too. Right now, I don't feel much of anything. I really am emotionally exhausted. Time's about up anyway. I think I'll call it a day.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine. I'm proud of the work you've done on this, Katherine. You've made real progress in a short time."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. That's good to hear. I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Well, I found out where I know Alex's mother from.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Larraine Rozzi is a head of SII's mail room. She also apparently has the ear of one Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lloyd Major.", "input": "", "output": "Really?  From the mailroom?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not exactly.  Did you ever hear of Nils Landors?  He's the head of Advertising and Presentations.  Apparently some time back, he used to be Lloyd's \"buddy,\" if you know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "I think I do."}, {"instruction": "That man is a total sleaze.  A few months ago, he tried to get Sylvia Bows fired while the woman was on a maternity leave.  Can you believe that?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, Nils loves to get dirt on everyone in the company.  I guess Larraine found a receptive ear in Nils.  She told him that I've been going out with her son.  Nils went to Lloyd.  And today, Lloyd came to my office very concerned for the image of the company--a CFO just can't be hanging out with a sixteen year old boy and requiring psychiatric help. He's worried that if the public gets wind of this, they would lose confidence in the company and the stock would drop. It couldn't affect our bond rating, but it could devalue the company. It's hard to be a Fortune 500 company if no one believes the Chief Financial Officer has her shit together enough to keep the books in order.", "input": "", "output": "Is that really his concern?"}, {"instruction": "I think so, yeah. I doubt Lloyd's really worried about my abilities. He's seen the books--however much he understands them--and Frank's assured him I'm the right one for the job. He trusts Frank, and I'm pretty sure he respects me. Certainly he knows I have my ducks in a row after the job I did on the retirement system. The other option is that he wants to get rid of me for some personal reason. I know he's upset about the way the Apple takeover fell through, but he can't believe I doctored the numbers out of spite or something. But if he didn't want me in the position, he wouldn't have endorsed me in the first place.", "input": "", "output": "Did he endorse you? I thought he was opposed to the idea."}, {"instruction": "Well, he was reluctant. I don't suppose \"endorse\" is the right word. \"Abstain\" is more like it. He just kept quiet and let Frank and the board make the decision.", "input": "", "output": "So what happens now?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I know he's a sly bastard. You don't get in that position by being Mr. Nice Guy all the time; politics can be rough. Hell, I had to knock off an occasional opponent during my climb up the ranks back at Nations Bank. I feel guilty about it, but that's the way it has to happen. I know Lloyd's good at the game. The question is whether he's motivated to hurt me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so. I think he's sincerely concerned for the company's image and valuation. I'm sure if he thought I was a liability, he'd do his best to get rid of me. But I don't think it's personal.", "input": "", "output": "Could a rumor like this actually hurt SII's bottom line?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not profits, no. But it could hurt our stock price, on which the total value of the company is based. Investors are as driven by psychology as much as P/E ratios--more so, probably. If they think they smell a scandal, or worse, a criminal action...", "input": "", "output": "Criminal action?"}, {"instruction": "Alex is a minor, remember?", "input": "", "output": "You just took him to dinner right?  Just how powerful a rumor has Larraine and Nils generated?"}, {"instruction": "Look, if the price of a stock drops on a rumor of my behavior, then the scapegoat is, of course, me.  No one will care to figure out what's true and what's fiction.", "input": "", "output": "But could this rumor actually cause the drop?"}, {"instruction": "Well, frankly, I don't really think so. Companies do lose value based on how the chief executive acts.  But I haven't heard of a case in which an implied indiscretion of a CFO caused the collapse of a corporate empire.  Look at Rupert Murdoch. He has a reputation as a megalomaniac--he's interested in owning the world more than in boosting his company's value. So NewsCorp's stock languishes despite a good P/E ratio and solid profits. And besides, the threat is low, and I have defenses.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "First of all, I doubt Rozzi and/or Landors have the wherewithal to make a real splash in the financial markets with this kind of news. They can just blab it around the company and tarnish my image here. But I don't care about that--my department is under control, and it's not like I'm up for promotion. Although I do care how the board views me. But if I should need a defense, I can use what I explained to Lloyd: I'm active in the art community--in fact my own brother is an artist. Alex is an artist, too. That's how we know each other. If I need to, I can make it known that I'm involved with Jake and that Alex is gay--so there's no way we could be romantically involved.", "input": "", "output": "Have you considered Alex's feelings about this scenario?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, we haven't actually talked about that.  Hmm. Well, I plan to talk to him anyway. I want to warn him what to expect, if it should come to that.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  But please listen and consider his feelings in this situation as well as your own. Did you tell Lloyd about Alex?"}, {"instruction": "I told him we met in the art community. I didn't mention that he's gay. It didn't seem necessary at the time, and I want some aces in the hole.  I also need to find out from Alex just how his mother got that little tidbit about psychotherapy. I managed to assure Lloyd that it wasn't a problem. I think he took that as a denial, but I'm sure he's skeptical. But therapy is actually easier to counter. Plenty of people see psychiatrists; it's not as much of a stigma as it used to be. If need be, I can ask you to explain that my condition does not affect my daily functioning and certainly not my professional performance. By the way, what is my diagnosis?", "input": "", "output": "Well, just to have something to put on the insurance forms, I'm using Simple Adjustment Disorder. It's an unspecified complaint but it satisfies the HMO."}, {"instruction": "I don't like the sound of that. It makes me seem maladjusted, somehow. Can you come up with something that clearly wouldn't affect my everyday life?", "input": "", "output": "I suppose I could use something like Delayed Grief Reaction, but that usually comes with depressed mood. I could comment on your unusually high level of functioning, that should counter the normal depression. But, Katherine, I'm uncomfortable putting anything like this in writing for public consumption. And I certainly don't want to appear before the board."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I have no intention of putting you before the board. A letter would do it. But I don't think it'll come to that. If Rozzi insists on pursuing this, I'll ask her if she wants the company to know her son is gay and has disowned her. I don't want to get involved in mudslinging--a smear campaign is not becoming to a ranking executive--but I think I can avoid it coming across that way. Like I said, I have some experience in politics myself. And if she really wants to push it, I can play the poor victim to the board. I know some of them personally, and poor Walter Montgomery still pants like a puppy whenever he sees me. I'll explain it all ever so innocently. She and Nils will come across as the aggressors, and the Board may even decide they don't need their destabilizing influence at SII. Ha! Nils Landors and Larraine Rozzi picked the wrong bitch to fuck with this time.", "input": "", "output": "You really think this could get them fired?"}, {"instruction": "If they really want to push it and I play my cards right, it could happen.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you want?"}, {"instruction": "Right now, I just want it to go away. But if they really decide to try to hurt me with this load of crap...", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. This has been a nice distraction--much different from my usual sessions. You know, the more I think about it, the more I hope they actually do try to make something out of this. I haven't had to play the politics in awhile; it could be fun. It would certainly add some spice to my life.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel your life is dull?"}, {"instruction": "You're so predictable, Doctor. Just as soon as I said that, I knew what your next question was going to be. My life is okay. I do things with Jake; I'm meeting new people, getting out. No, my life's not dull. But a new, unexpected spice can be exciting, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it can be."}, {"instruction": "So I guess next time, we'll get back to the regular grind. By the way, I got a report from the detectives. They're having a hard time locating my dad. Apparently the FAA won't give up the records they need. I thought that they could just find his pilot's license and get his address from that, but that's not public record. So they want to send someone to Alaska to ask around at his last known location and try to pick up the trail that way.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds time consuming."}, {"instruction": "It sounds expensive, is what is sounds. I told them to hold off on that a while. I'm starting to wonder if it's worth that much to me. I've already paid over $700 for nothing. I wouldn't miss a few grand, but I don't know if finding him will really settle anything in my mind. It may be better just to come to grips with it here and leave him alone. Talking to him might just make it worse.", "input": "", "output": "It might."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Well, I'll think on it some more. Meanwhile, I have shopping to do.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Phil expressed an interest in making soups this winter, so I'm getting him a Crock Pot for Christmas. I'd like to get him an apartment with a real kitchen and that isn't part of the Jet Stream, but he likes where he is.", "input": "", "output": "He hasn't patched up his drafts yet, huh?"}, {"instruction": "No, he's been too busy with that mural. You should go see it, it's really something.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe I will. Well, time's about up for today."}, {"instruction": "Oh, hey, I need to let you know--I'll be here next week, but the week after that I'm going to Columbia for Christmas. That Wednesday is Christmas Eve anyway, and I doubt you'll be working. But the next Wednesday is New Year's Eve. Are you going to be here then?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm going to be available, but just to patients who are in crisis.  The holidays are a difficult time of year.  If you have a crisis, of course I'm here for you, but otherwise let's just skip both sessions.  So we'll keep next Wednesday's session and then the next time I'll see you will be in 1998--let's see, that will be January 7th at 5 pm, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.  So next week as normal and then no sessions for two week--that'll be fine. See you Wednesday.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Merry Christmas!", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. You seem chipper today."}, {"instruction": "I am; it's kind of strange. Usually I hate Christmas, but this year it's not so bad. Here's your present.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, you didn't have to do this."}, {"instruction": "I know, that's what makes it so great. It's neither expected nor reciprocal. I just felt like it. I got you something just because I wanted to get you something, not out of any sense of obligation. That's the spirit of giving.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you feel that way. Thank you.  So this Christmas is better than usual?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, it's not Christmas itself, but rather the whole mandatory gift-giving thing. Phil's been trying to bring me around for years, but this is the first time I think I really understood it. Jake says he doesn't bother trying to figure out what people really want for Christmas; he just gives them what he wants them to have and doesn't worry about it. He says people should be grateful getting anything for free. I coupled that with what Phil's been saying about gift giving being about the giver and not the receiver, and I finally got it! Giving should be fun for me--like a game or something just for my own amusement. So I saw something I think fits you, and I gave it to you. And if you don't like it, I don't care! I like it, that's what matters. And I understand something else, too. It's a gift--it's yours now, and I can't say anything about what you decide to do with it. If you want to give it away, or burn it, or make it a cat toy, that's your business. You're under no obligation to me to like it, or use it, or anything. I gave it, that was fun for me. But now I have to let it go.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good attitude. How did you feel before you discovered all of this?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I used to be much more concerned with equity. I had to give everyone something at least as valuable as what they gave me. And it had to be carefully thought out to match their tastes and needs. And it had to be balanced with what I gave other people who that person knew, so no one would feel slighted--no one would think I was playing favorites. I still feel those pressures; it's hard not to think that way. But I'm working on it, and I think I'm doing a good job.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, our society teaches us some odd things about gift giving, equity being the most prevalent. It sounds like you took it to something of an extreme, though."}, {"instruction": "Well, I do have a tendency to be extreme...or I should say I did. Ever since I got off the east coast, I've been moderating. Phil has a lot to do with that. We've gotten a lot closer since we moved here, and he's turned out to be amazingly wise. That boy should be a guru; society could learn a lot from him.", "input": "", "output": "He certainly seems to be good for you."}, {"instruction": "He is. But you've helped, too. I can feel a difference in myself just since I've been seeing you...what? Six months now?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you've made wonderful progress. I've seen you loosen up quite a bit, give others the benefit of the doubt, put much less pressure on yourself. How about your original complaints? Do you still hoard food and supplies for a feeling of security? And how do you handle disruptions in your routine?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the hoarding has slowed down. I still hate to run out of stuff. But if it happens, I don't go nuts over it. I still have routines, but they're much more flexible. I used to have a shopping day, a cleaning day--a designated time for everything on each particular day. Now, I do it when it needs to be done. But everything still gets done--I don't run out of stuff, my house stays very clean, the laundry doesn't stack up. I think some degree of routine is healthy.", "input": "", "output": "I agree. But what if the laundry should stack up for some reason?"}, {"instruction": "Then I do it when I can. I remember why I came in here in the first place. That seems so ridiculous to me now! Of course it did then too, that's why I came in. Can you explain to me how all that rigidity was connected to how I felt about my father? That seems a little far fetched.", "input": "", "output": "I think there are two things happening.  A little girl who loses her father feels that she has lost control over what is most important to her.  Keeping things tightly under your control was a way of trying to keep the lid on a world which wasn't always ordered the way you wanted it to be.  And I think there was a spill-over effect. You spent a lot of energy keeping control of your feelings. So much so that you began to believe that you had to keep control of everything, and that actually helped you for a while. A less disciplined person could not have advanced in her career the way you did. But it snowballed, becoming less useful and more pathological until finally something had to break. It's good that you had the presence of mind to seek therapy when that happened, rather than redouble your efforts and just lock down tighter."}, {"instruction": "Well, Phil had a lot to do with that.", "input": "", "output": "He helped get you started, that's true. But you took it seriously and worked diligently at home as well as in here. You're a strong woman, Katherine. Many people can't face their feelings the way you do and make the conscientious changes that you have."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. This makes me realize that we're halfway through our time and we haven't done any real therapy yet.", "input": "", "output": "I don't know about that. I think reviewing the progress you've made is important, too. You should be proud of your new attitudes about gift giving, and you should be proud of the progress you've made in therapy. Give yourself a pat on the back, Katherine. You deserve it."}, {"instruction": "A little positive reinforcement, eh, Doc? Okay, I'm feeling good anyway; I'll feel a little better. Congratulations to me. Good work, Katherine. I'm healthier than I used to be, and it's mostly my own doing.", "input": "", "output": "Hear, hear!"}, {"instruction": "Okay, enough self-promotion. Oh, no, no--not enough. Fifteen more days!", "input": "", "output": "Fifteen? New year?"}, {"instruction": "And what happens that day?", "input": "", "output": "Of course, your promotion."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It finally came home to me at Frank's retirement party. That's when I started counting the days. You know, Frank must not be the same person at home that he is at work--his family just adores him, and there seems to be no tension there at all. I finally met all the children and got it straight about who is who, as if it matters now. One son--the product of his first marriage--is gay and is dating an absolutely gorgeous man. Alex would love him. Another--the product of an affair with his now fianc\u00e9--is a hippie, utterly charming, dating this total flake. And I didn't realize that his fianc\u00e9--with whom he had an affair and a child--is his ex-wife's sister. God, this sounds like \"The Rich and The Dutiful.\" And I thought Frank was as boring as they come. But his daughter is clearly his daughter--composed, organized, polished, and educated. And the resemblance is uncanny. I never realized how attractive Frank is until I saw his beautiful young daughter. I considered trying to find a way to introduce her to Phil, but she's too mainstream. I don't think she could deal with the loosely turbulent, care-free attitude of the art world.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Is she that much more mainstream than you are?"}, {"instruction": "Touch\u00e9. But I watched her for a while, I think I got a pretty good idea of who she is. She put this whole soir\u00e9e together and did a wonderful job. It must have taken hours just to decorate the house. And she even had a little jazz trio! This reminds me, I tried that place you suggested. Very nice: neon, smoke haze, the whole deal. You could almost believe hi-fi was still a new thing. It puts me in the mood to drink gin.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been drinking much lately?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not since Thanksgiving--that was a mess. But you can't listen to jazz and not smoke cigarettes, so my Benson & Hedges intake is up. And Jake has taken to cigars, but that has to stop, at least in the house.", "input": "", "output": "How are things going with Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Fine, fine. But the big news is Larraine Rozzi. It seems Friday she felt the need to alert our PR department of a possible public relations problem.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, no."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. Tom came to see me Monday.", "input": "", "output": "Tom? Is he from the PR department?"}, {"instruction": "No, Tom is a VP for marketing. I guess Landor wasn't effective enough for Rozzi, so she went to Grover Hamilton in Public Relations. Grover brought it to Tom. Anyway, it was fun, we had a good laugh. He came in all smiling and jolly and said, \"Hey, you sly dog, what's this about you dating a high school kid? I wish I could get a sixteen year old.\" I said, \"Oh, you don't know the half of it.\" So I told him about Alex being gay--which got us joking about doing conversions--and about how we supposedly met at his psychiatrist's office--which got us joking about how Rozzi needs a psychiatrist. She already has a reputation as something of a vindictive shrew. Tom asked me how I had gotten on her shit list. So now it's out that Rozzi's kid is gay and that he's seeing a shrink. And it's out that I'm a patron of the arts and like to help out starving artists. I'm a sweetheart, Rozzi's a bitch.", "input": "", "output": "Have you confronted Larraine about this at all?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's where this is going. Tom and I decided that this had gone far enough. So we brought it to Rozzi's boss--VP for internal operations--Malcolm Spunt. He's also de facto my boss--finance being an internal operation. Anyway, we told him the whole story. He brought Rozzi in, and then the shit hit the fan.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, my."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. When she saw the three of us waiting there for her, I actually watched the color drain from her face. I thought that was it--she had met her match and was going to fold. But she didn't. That woman doesn't know when to quit. Malcolm is a hell of a manager, I could learn from him. He laid it all out, pointed out how silly her allegations were, told her she was making a fool of herself and it would be in her best interest to stop. But he managed to do it all with respect and in a positive light, talking about the good of the company rather than what an ass she was being. If only she could have let it go at that, it would have been all right.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Like I said, she doesn't know when to quit. She started in with the same stuff all over again, trying to make me the bad guy. She wouldn't give it up. Finally, she was on her feet shaking her finger at me and yelling about how I was the bad seed in the company, not her. He told her twice to calm down. Then finally, he stood up and shouted, \"Larraine, sit down and shut up!\" Boy! Have you ever met Malcolm Spunt?", "input": "", "output": "No, I can't say that I have."}, {"instruction": "He's a tall, burly black man with a big, authoritative voice. I've never seen him angry before, and I hope I never do again--it's scary. He chewed her up one side and down the other. It was humiliating; I actually got embarrassed for her. I wanted to tell him to ease up, but I couldn't think how. Then he sent her home.", "input": "", "output": "He fired her?"}, {"instruction": "No, just administrative leave. Then he kicked me and Tom out, too. He came by about an hour later to apologize, and assured me I won't be having any more trouble from Rozzi.", "input": "", "output": "So do you think it's settled?"}, {"instruction": "It seems to be. I get the feeling she faces some pretty stern action, if Malcolm hears of her pulling this kind of stunt again.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What about Alex?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm sure he's heard about it by now. I guess it can't be good for their relationship. But I don't think he'll blame me; he knows who his mother is.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, has it occurred to you that Larraine might want to get fired?"}, {"instruction": "Um, no, it hasn't. I thought she was just stupid. Why would she...of course. Unemployment. Then a lawsuit that the company would much rather settle than see in the courts. Clever. I should mention that to Malcolm. And we'd better start covering our ass.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good idea."}, {"instruction": "Thanks for bringing that up. With that in mind, I think we can be sure Rozzi won't be leaving us for quite a while.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I guess not. Well, time's up. See you in three weeks?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. Oh, I want to get Alex something, but I'm drawing a blank. Do you have any ideas?", "input": "", "output": "What do you want him to have?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes--the perfect response. Throw me back my own philosophy. I'd like to help him with his art, but he seems to have all the supplies he needs. He's working on a piece for me, did I tell you that?", "input": "", "output": "No, you didn't."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's cute, kind of whimsical. I'll show it to you when I get it.", "input": "", "output": "Please do."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, I guess that's it. Have a good holiday, and I'll see you in two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine. And thanks for the present."}, {"instruction": "You're welcome. Won't you open it?", "input": "", "output": "You don't want me to wait until Christmas?"}, {"instruction": "No, I want to see you open it.  Do you mind?", "input": "", "output": "Not at all.  I suppose it's a tie, from the shape and heft of the box."}, {"instruction": "Well, I couldn't fit a case of brandy in there, that's for sure.", "input": "", "output": "It's a Dali.  I know that image."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, \"The Great Paranoiac.\"  I thought it was the perfect tie.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you.  It will match my Edvard Munch tie."}, {"instruction": "You don't really!  \"The Scream?\"", "input": "", "output": "A gift from my parents for passing the psychiatric boards.  I don't generally wear it around my patients, though."}, {"instruction": "I can imagine.  Merry Christmas, Doctor Balis!", "input": "", "output": "Merry Christmas, Katherine.  And thanks for the necktie."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Yeah, I had a good time--went to parties, exchanged gifts, ate too much. I saw Phil's friends do a couple of New Year's Eve fireworks over the Bay. And oh, wow! I just couldn't believe it! Phil's cooked for me before, and it always turned out like everything he does--unusual, but full of his own particular flavor. It's always good. Anyway, with the Crock Pot I gave him and the huge spice rack full of spices that Jake gave him to go with it, my brother Philip made the most amazing creamy lobster bisque. It was the hit of the party. There's not a drop left, except for this.", "input": "", "output": "For me? Are you sure? Why, thank you, Katherine. I'll try it tonight."}, {"instruction": "Don't thank me, it's from Phil--it's his thanks for all you've done for me. He says I'm a new woman. And I agree.", "input": "", "output": "So do I. Tell him it was my pleasure. And thank him for the soup."}, {"instruction": "I will. I left a message with your service inviting you.", "input": "", "output": "I got it, thank you. I had plans. Besides, I don't think it's a good idea to socialize with patients. I have to keep our relationship professional."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess so. So how was your holiday? Did you go to Time Square?", "input": "", "output": "Oh my, no. I didn't go to New York this time. I had a good time right here in the city. But that reminds me. I'm going on vacation this month. I'll be gone the next two weeks. So I'm afraid I'll have to miss our next two sessions."}, {"instruction": "Vacation? Jesus, what's with you? You just had two weeks off.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I had to catch up on the end of the year HMO bureaucracy. You know how bad that can be, Katherine. Plus, I was still on call for patients in crisis."}, {"instruction": "Well, hell, you could have given me some warning.", "input": "", "output": "I apologize. I'd have liked more notice myself, but this opportunity just came up. Katherine, why are you so upset about this?"}, {"instruction": "It's just...we'll miss two weeks. I came in all excited about getting back to work, all ready to really tackle the Daddy stuff again, and now we're going to miss another two weeks. Damn it, Balis. I just want to get on with it, and now you're taking off somewhere.", "input": "", "output": "Sorry. I understand your frustration; we have missed a lot of time recently. But we can tackle the Daddy stuff as intensely as you like as soon as I get back. In fact, you don't even have to wait for me..."}, {"instruction": "Uh, I think I'll just wait.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. You can still get in touch with me in an emergency.  And there's a doctor covering for me on call."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. It's okay. I can certainly understand your need to take a vacation from all of us--you patients, I mean. Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you. But it's frustrating, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I know. Do you want to start talking about your father today?"}, {"instruction": "Let's wait. I don't want to have that big of a gap, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "So. I guess I've caught you up on what's happened to me while you were gone. Christmas was nice. New Year's was a blast. On to other things. Hey, here's an interesting tidbit: it seems I sent Larraine Rozzi to the nut house.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. How about that? I told you Malcolm sent her home without pay after our little confrontation?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Well, the next thing I heard about it, she was in a psychiatric facility. She's out now, but on disability. And she's already put in for maternity leave. So I guess we won't be seeing much of Ms. Rozzi for a while.", "input": "", "output": "That's quite a development."}, {"instruction": "Isn't it though. You know, I've made men cry. I've broken careers. I've repossessed businesses. But I've never actually driven anyone insane before.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I don't think you caused this..."}, {"instruction": "Well, sure, it wasn't just me. But I can't help feeling at least a little responsible.", "input": "", "output": "How so? You defended yourself..."}, {"instruction": "Well, it was a little more than that. I came down on her with both feet.", "input": "", "output": "But it was her boss who suspended her. You gave him the facts; he made the decisions."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I didn't have to go to him. I could have spoken right to her, tried to smooth things over before it got out of hand...", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, stop for a moment.  Do you actually want to take the blame for Larraine's problems?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Well? What happened between you and Larraine was a symptom, not a cause. Whatever's going on in her head started long before you entered the picture and would have progressed even if you had never met. You just happened to get caught up in her instability."}, {"instruction": "Still, I did get her suspended...", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. She was told to stop. And she was insubordinate.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, blatantly so. And you didn't push her to that. That was her own decision. Whatever compelled her to that behavior is her own issue. You weren't the cause, just a handy target."}, {"instruction": "So if I wasn't around, she'd have found someone else to go off on.", "input": "", "output": "Or some other way to cause herself trouble, yes. But you didn't push her over the edge; you had no way of even knowing she was on the edge."}, {"instruction": "It was just my bad luck to be nearby when it happened. Hmm. Okay, I can accept that. I'd rather not feel guilty for that nut case anyway. Although, I suppose I could be a bit more sympathetic.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps. I'll bet Alex could use some."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess he could. Jeez, with a mom like that, no wonder he's disturbed. Oh, that sounded bad. What's the politically correct term for someone in therapy?", "input": "", "output": "I believe it's \"deranged.\""}, {"instruction": "Thank you, that's helpful.", "input": "", "output": "So are you okay about Larraine?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I guess she'd have managed to land in the hospital eventually with or without me.", "input": "", "output": "Most likely. What else is on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, we could talk about Jake.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I love him.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "But we've become...well, kind of complacent.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we were sitting around the house the other day--I was watching Masterpiece Theater, he was reading--when I looked at him and I realized: we're comfortable. But that's all we are. We're a predictable, standardized, American couple. We have our own friends, though some of them overlap. We see each other several times a week, make love on the weekends, go to the movies, walk by the beach--and that's it. At parties, we split up as soon as we get there, mingle with different cliques, and hook up again to go home and have sex--though the sex is still wonderful. I think he goes to seminars on Wednesday afternoons or something--he's always coming up with new and exciting ideas. But where's the man I played frisbee with at the Mud Flats on our first date? Where's the little poems I used to find stuck to rose thorns outside my door? And for that matter, where's the star-struck girl who swooned at all those things? And here's something else: in the six months we've been dating, I've still never seen him laugh.", "input": "", "output": "Does he smile?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, sure, he smiles. He'll even chuckle a little on occasion. And he has a sense of humor. But he never comes right out and laughs. It's kind of unnerving.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe he's just reserved."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, this is the guy who sings at the top of his lungs while riding a motorcycle. He hang glides, he rock climbs, he schmoozes with the glitararti. I don't think \"reserved\" is quite the word.", "input": "", "output": "Still, sometimes that behavior can be compensatory, designed to give the impression of self-confidence, covering up insecurity."}, {"instruction": "That doesn't ring true at all. Jake's security is almost...arrogance. I've known him for six months now, I think I'd see if he was hiding anything. The truth is he's self-assured, confident, and outgoing. Jake has nothing to prove to anyone. That's part of why I'm with him, there's nothing fake there.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So the problem I'm hearing is that there's no excitement in the relationship."}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "Do you love him?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Do you enjoy his company?"}, {"instruction": "Usually. Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Is there anything about him that makes you uncomfortable? Is he domineering, possessive, vulgar, prejudiced? Anything that you don't like?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he has his quirks. Everyone does. But there's nothing major like that, no.", "input": "", "output": "So it's a good relationship that you're satisfied with, it just lacks excitement."}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah, I guess so.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, excitement takes doing. You have to create excitement. What do you like to do on a date?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I like plays and concerts, discussing museum exhibits.", "input": "", "output": "But those are the things you just said you're bored with. What about exciting things?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I enjoyed riding the motorcycle. And the hang gliding was a lot of fun. And he said he'd take me kayaking when it got warm again.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you suggest some of those things?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's winter now. None of that's very good in the cold.", "input": "", "output": "So use your imagination. Katherine, you have to put excitement in your life, it doesn't just appear. And you can't count on someone else to provide it. I'm sure if you suggested one of those things to Jake, he would be interested."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess he would.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't have to have him. If he doesn't want to do something you feel like doing, go alone. Or take some other friends."}, {"instruction": "You're right. Why am I waiting around for Jake to provide the fun? I'm a grown woman; I can make these decisions.", "input": "", "output": "Certainly."}, {"instruction": "But I guess that's not all I miss.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, well, it's the romance. It's the courting. He doesn't bring me flowers anymore; he doesn't compose sonnets. It's that sort of thing.", "input": "", "output": "Ah, yes. Do you do those things for him?"}, {"instruction": "Gee, I hadn't thought of that. Huh, interesting. What am I? Some Southern Belle waiting to be swept off her feet? Needing a man to do everything for me? I can do those things, too.", "input": "", "output": "Sure you can. A relationship is a two-way street. And so is communication. Maybe you should bring up these issues with Jake and let him know how you feel. It could be that he doesn't realize you still appreciate those things."}, {"instruction": "Hmm, could be.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I'm afraid our time's up for today. Keep doing the work you've been doing outside the office, it's been very productive. And I'll see you on the 28th, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Be ready to talk about Daddy.", "input": "", "output": "I will be. Good night."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Did you enjoy your vacation?", "input": "", "output": "I did, thank you. I had a wonderful time. How have you been?"}, {"instruction": "Not too bad. I quit smoking.", "input": "", "output": "Good for you. What made you decide to do that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, you can't smoke in the bars any more. So there's no place left to smoke but at home. But now I have to watch it when I'm at the jazz place; without a cigarette, I tend to drink more. I figured I only had two a day anyway, and it made the place kind of stale. So I just stopped. Strange thing, though--the evening news just isn't as interesting without a cigarette. I find that I constantly want to be doing something, so I work around the house, not actually watching television, just listening. It's amazing how shallow the stories really are without the video to engage the mind.", "input": "", "output": "Well, they only have a short time. And we are a very visual society. Do you get the paper?"}, {"instruction": "I get Newsweek. But what I was getting at is that I've discovered All Things Considered. It's a radio news magazine show, very thoughtful, in-depth stuff. Runs on NPR from four to six. You should try it.", "input": "", "output": "I've heard it, it's very good. Have you heard Morning Edition?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's how I found it. I have KALW programmed in the car and at home. They do interesting things late at night.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm glad you've stopped smoking, and that you've made these discoveries. What else is on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, lots of things. That's part of what's exciting about the show, I find there's more on my mind. And I'm picking up more magazines and surfing the web. It's like I'm smarter now, more aware. I'm branching out. Life is about more than just work and my boyfriend. Oh, the neatest thing happened. Just as I was about to talk to Jake about putting the spice back in the relationship, he presented me with this sculpture. He's not much of an artist, but he says this is the best work he's ever done. It took him weeks. It's tulips. He sculpted this bouquet of ceramic tulips for me. And I said he never gave me flowers any more!", "input": "", "output": "That's very nice. And what have you done to put the spice back in the relationship?"}, {"instruction": "We went and played LazerStorm. You have to have a group, so we took Alex out for his birthday. It was me and Alex's friend Tony against Jake and Alex plus some other people we met there. What a blast! I found this little tower in the corner and hid in there, playing sniper. Of course, Jake's a natural, slinking around like a commando, picking off his hapless victims with impunity. I think he was Viet Cong in his last life.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like fun. But if it was Alex's present, then it wasn't really for you and Jake, was it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not entirely. But it was something exciting that we did together. As for just us, we're going skiing for a week next month. I told you about that, didn't I?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, just the two of you at a lodge for a week. That sounds wonderful."}, {"instruction": "I think it will be.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "I thought I was getting over my dad--you know, coming to grips with it, finding peace with it. But I think about him, and I find that I'm not there yet. It's still very sad.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, this is a big loss that you've just recently been starting to feel. It'll take some time before you can get used to it. As for being sad, you may always feel a little sad when you think about your dad. It was a sad thing that happened. But one day, you'll be able to look back on all that happened without being overwhelmed with sadness. And soon I'd hope you'll be able to balance the sadness with some of the joy that you feel remembering the time you had together."}, {"instruction": "Well, I do have that. There's all the nice memories of holidays. And every time he came home, it was good. And all the things he taught me...I didn't know I had all these memories of him until I started talking to you. Now a bunch of stuff is coming back: daddy teaching me to fly a kite; riding on his lap as he drove the car. I even remember him teaching me to tie my shoes. Mama tried for days to teach me, and I tried to learn, I really did. Then daddy came home and had me doing it in a few minutes. I guess he always could communicate with me better. Did I ever show you this?", "input": "", "output": "No, I haven't seen this. Is that your father?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's him. I guess he's about the age I am now, maybe a little older.", "input": "", "output": "Fine looking man. He does look happy."}, {"instruction": "Like he owns the world, doesn't he? You know...I kind of feel proud when I see him like this. I mean look at him. He's all jaunty and confident and happy. He's going after what he wants. I'm glad for him.", "input": "", "output": "It's good that you can feel that way."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah. It's still awful goddamn sad the way we split up.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it is."}, {"instruction": "I find I'm still wondering about him: whether he's alive; what he's doing; if he ever thinks about me. And I have this fantasy that he's keeping track of me, watching my career, telling his buddies in the bar about his rich, successful daughter.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I want to talk about him. Now when people ask about my family, I tell them that the last time I saw my father was when I was eleven and I haven't heard from him since. Everybody goes, \"Oh, how sad.\" Crap. I don't want to be a sad case. I want to be proud of my daddy. I want to say my mother's a banker in South Carolina and my father's a bush pilot in Alaska.", "input": "", "output": "So why don't you say that?"}, {"instruction": "It's not true.", "input": "", "output": "Sure it is. At least it was true the last time you knew."}, {"instruction": "So am I supposed to say, \"The last I knew, my father was a bush pilot in Alaska?\"", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Because then they'll want to know why I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Tell them you lost touch."}, {"instruction": "See, that's just it. I don't want to be out of touch with my father. It's like not having one at all.", "input": "", "output": "You know that's not true. You have a very clear connection with your father. You have pleasant memories; you retain the influence he had on you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, I have all that. And I'm trying to be satisfied with it, I really am. But there's still this gap. I just don't know what happened to him, whether he found what he was after, and how he feels about me.", "input": "", "output": "You don't know how he felt about you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, okay. I know how he felt back then.", "input": "", "output": "And how was that?"}, {"instruction": "Haven't we done this already?", "input": "", "output": "I know, but I think it would do you good to hear it again. Humor me."}, {"instruction": "Okay. He loved me.", "input": "", "output": "How do you know?"}, {"instruction": "He didn't want to break us up. He wanted me to come to see him, maybe even move there. He kept calling and writing until my mother made him stop. And he told me he loved me every time we talked.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that's changed?"}, {"instruction": "You don't stop loving your kids, do you?", "input": "", "output": "Not usually. How do you imagine he'd feel about what you've achieved?"}, {"instruction": "He'd be proud. He was always proud of my accomplishments. Grades, awards, school plays.", "input": "", "output": "So what about the rest of it? Did he find what he was after?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess the picture tells the story. And he kept telling me how good he felt about what he was doing. He always sounded excited when he talked about it. That's part of what got me so hot to go.", "input": "", "output": "So you're confident that he loves you and would be proud of you, and you're sure he found the dream he went looking for."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Yeah, I feel good about that. But I still don't know what happened after that. I suppose I could pretend he was dead. But that doesn't really close it.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Because I'd always know I was pretending. I work with numbers, Doctor Balis, I've never had much of an imagination. I examine the books, I analyze the plans. I need evidence.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I could get the detectives back on the case.", "input": "", "output": "That's an option."}, {"instruction": "I'm pretty sure I could find something to say to him if we did meet.", "input": "", "output": "And what if they can't find him?"}, {"instruction": "Then I'm no worse off than I'm now, except a few grand lighter. The other possibility is that he's dead. And then at least I would know. I mean I'd have an end point.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds to me like you have an end point now."}, {"instruction": "How so?", "input": "", "output": "You're comfortable with how he felt about you. You know where he went and what he found. Katherine, how do you feel about him?"}, {"instruction": "He's my daddy. I love him.", "input": "", "output": "Good. But what about his leaving? Any resentment there?"}, {"instruction": "Um, a little. Not much. You've got that expectant look. What are you getting at?", "input": "", "output": "You know he'd be proud of what you've accomplished. How do you feel about what he's done for himself?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I see. Well, I've said I'm happy for him. Looking back on it all, he was stagnating where he was. Hmm. I'd hate to see Philip stuck where he wasn't comfortable. And I'm happy that he's happy, whatever his living conditions are. So I guess I'd feel the same way about daddy.", "input": "", "output": "Good for you. So you know he loved you. You know he'd be happy for you. And you know he found what he wanted, and you're pleased about that. Do you think it can be over now?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I never really know what I'm feeling when I leave here. I get all mixed up.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. Well, our time is up anyway. Think it over, let things settle down, and we'll talk more about this next week. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, okay. Remember to say happy birthday to Alex.", "input": "", "output": "I will. Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. How are you?"}, {"instruction": "Christage.", "input": "", "output": "Excuse me?"}, {"instruction": "Christage. The age of Christ.", "input": "", "output": "What about it?"}, {"instruction": "That's me. Monday was my thirty-third birthday.", "input": "", "output": "Happy Birthday. Are you feeling a little down about it?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure it shows. I've been mopey and quiet since Sunday. Everyone's noticed, though you're the first I've told.", "input": "", "output": "What about Jake?"}, {"instruction": "You know, Jake's never asked me my birthday. I don't think he really cares.", "input": "", "output": "And you've never mentioned it?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It never seemed important, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Has he noticed your mood?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't seen him. I'm sure I'll snap out of it by the weekend. I'm already starting to get over it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What is it about thirty-three that's got you down?"}, {"instruction": "I keep thinking of this song. I heard it at Phil's, he plays a lot of folk--acoustic stuff. I don't remember the artist. It goes, \"If you don't die in glory at the age of Christ, your story is just growing old.\"", "input": "", "output": "I don't like the sound of that."}, {"instruction": "It's a real pretty song. I didn't find it depressing when I heard it.", "input": "", "output": "So how does this apply to you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't feel the need to die in glory. But I've been thinking about what I have accomplished with my life so far.", "input": "", "output": "And what have you came up with?"}, {"instruction": "Not much. Not much of value, anyway. I mean not much of value to society. I make oodles of money, more than I know how to spend. I've been investing more than half my earnings since I came to California, and I'm a decent investor. Add in my stock options and I'm easily a millionaire. I have a top position in a growing company, and I could even become a board member in a few years if I play it right. Retire at 50? Hell, I could retire at 40 and still be rich when I die.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "But it's just money. I've worked my ass off my whole life, and all I have to show for it is stuff. I have a rider on my insurance to cover $20,000 worth of fine art. But the piece I value most is one of Phil's, he gave it to me just because he thought I'd like it. If I had to, I'd become a prostitute before I'd sell this piece. That's value. Do you give blood?", "input": "", "output": "I have, in the past. I should do it more often."}, {"instruction": "You should make a habit of it, it's a great thing. I was talking to the phlebotomist last time I was in. He makes less than $10 an hour, but he loves it. He says he gets to help people feel good about themselves and, at the same time, saves the lives of people he never met. I need to do something like that. I've played the money game, and frankly, I've won. But it's not satisfying. That phlebotomist guy's satisfied; he's happy with himself. I want to do something that's good for society or at least for my community.", "input": "", "output": "What's stopping you?"}, {"instruction": "That's a good question. Part of it is that I don't know what to do. I'm good at making money, I'm good at balancing the books. I don't want to let those talents go to waste. I love the arts--museums, galleries, symphony, theater. I dream of being involved with that. But that conflicts with the humanitarian work I want to do.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Fine arts are for the rich. You don't see a lot of ditch diggers at the symphony.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not so sure about that. Maybe you could work to make the arts more accessible to the common man."}, {"instruction": "How would that be humanitarian?", "input": "", "output": "It would help reduce the stratification of our culture, bring us more together."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I'm sure there's a world of things out there that you could do that would use your talents and make you feel good about what you're doing. It might take a few tries to find one that satisfies you. You don't have to come up with it right away. Wouldn't you feel better just to be working towards your goal?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose I would.", "input": "", "output": "Are you in a big hurry to quit your job?"}, {"instruction": "Um, not really. That's another thing. I'm pretty good at what I'm doing now. I'm kind of basking in the glory of achieving what I set out to do. I could stay here a while longer. Besides, it's kind of understood that by taking this position I've renewed my commitment to the company.", "input": "", "output": "So you have time to think about your next move."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess I do.", "input": "", "output": "What about volunteer work?"}, {"instruction": "I've been thinking of that. I might even want to act. I'm thinking of trying out the next time the community theater holds auditions.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like fun."}, {"instruction": "I hope so. Doctor Balis, is this just a mid-life crisis?", "input": "", "output": "You're a little young for that, but I suppose it could be. What makes you think so?"}, {"instruction": "I know I'm young, but I have been hit kind of hard by this age of Christ thing. I'm a successful executive thinking of chucking it all...oh God. Yeah, that's what got this all started!", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "A radio report I heard Saturday: \"This American Life,\" I think. The theme was breaking out of the boxes that our lives become. The first segment was an eighteen year old Mexican girl who wanted to go to college and make something of herself. Rather, she was an American citizen, born here to Mexican immigrants. Her family felt like she was putting on airs and trying to show them up by becoming more successful than they were. They were pressuring her to stay and be a regular Mexican girl. But I'm getting off track. The second segment was about a man, Russell something? Something Russell--a real common sounding name. He owned a clothing business in Chicago, made well into six figures--like I do--and was worth something like 33 mil. He started feeling like he hated the rat race, hated his life, and wanted a way out. So one day, he robbed a bank.", "input": "", "output": "That's a little drastic."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, isn't it though? But it worked. They interviewed him in jail. He'll get out in another four years. He feels great. He's a convicted felon and is worth nothing, but he says now he gets to make himself into whatever he wants. He's free.", "input": "", "output": "Well, he used a pretty radical strategy, but I guess I can understand what he's saying. Is that how you're feeling?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't think I'll be robbing a bank next Thursday. But I would like to remake myself, find my dream, and start following it.", "input": "", "output": "You feel a strong need to start following your dream?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Gee, that sounds familiar, doesn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it does."}, {"instruction": "Damn. I didn't see that until now. I guess that's something we have in common. Hmm. Maybe I understand him better than I thought.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe so."}, {"instruction": "Except daddy knew just what his dream was.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that was lucky for him. But you have the time to figure that out for yourself. And the resources."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, resources I have and time, too, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "So how do you feel about turning 33 now?"}, {"instruction": "Better. I'm not a failure, I guess. I did succeed at something. Now, it's time to take on something else, make a new life. Hey, I can die in glory at the age of Christ!", "input": "", "output": "How's that?"}, {"instruction": "Think about it. I have the glory: my present position--top of the heap, wealthy--it's everything I wanted to accomplish. And I'm talking about starting another life, which means ending this one. It's a symbolic death, not a literal one, but we're talking about poetry, so it fits.", "input": "", "output": "I guess it does."}, {"instruction": "Well, I have a lot of thinking to do, but I feel better about this. Thanks, Doctor Balis. Talking to you always seems to clear things up.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that. See you next week, then?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. Good, there's Alex. Boy, there's a kid who needs a friend. Listen, what else can I do for him? He has some really hard luck and I want to help, but I feel kind of powerless.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes the best thing you can do for a friend is just to be available and to listen without judgment. You can't solve his problems, but you can be supportive. That can do a world of good."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Thanks, I can do that. Well, see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Think we'll be getting some more rain?", "input": "", "output": "I certainly hope not. Things have been too wet lately."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Did your power go out?", "input": "", "output": "No. Yours?"}, {"instruction": "Just for a couple hours. I didn't even lose the fish in the freezer.", "input": "", "output": "Good. What's on your mind today?"}, {"instruction": "A couple of things. Poor Alex. We talked for hours this weekend. He opened up a lot, really seemed to appreciate my company. What a roller coaster his life is! Makes me wonder what I'm whining about sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, you can't compare your situation to anyone else's. Your issues are just as valid in your own psychic makeup...."}, {"instruction": "Hey, I wasn't saying my issues aren't valid. Actually, I'm kind of encouraged that they're so easy to handle. And I know that they still need to be handled, easy or not.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, good. Please, go on."}, {"instruction": "Alex talked a lot, but I can tell that there was something else really eating at him, something he won't talk to me about. But I'm not pushing it. I get the feeling that wouldn't be productive.", "input": "", "output": "Good call. He doesn't need pressure from his friends, he needs support. The two seldom go together. If he wants to tell you about it, he will. Meanwhile, it's good that he has you to confide in, without pressure or judgment. That's a healthy thing for anyone to have."}, {"instruction": "I wish I could do more for him. You know, fix it.", "input": "", "output": "I think you're doing more for him than you know. He doesn't need you to fix it, just to be his friend."}, {"instruction": "I guess sometimes just talking can be helpful.", "input": "", "output": "That's a big part of the process of therapy. Look what it did for you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I didn't even know what my problems were until I came in here. Now at least I know why I'm miserable.", "input": "", "output": "And now you can take steps to ameliorate that."}, {"instruction": "\"Ameliorate\"--that's a nice one. Hey, if I was a psychiatrist, then maybe sometimes I could fix it.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes.  Is that something you think you'd like to do?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not medical school, no. But what about a Ph.D? How long would that take?", "input": "", "output": "Generally, five years, once you've been accepted. It's not an easy program, though."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. Day after day, to have people trooping in and have them tell me their troubles, expecting me to have the answers. I don't think that's for me. I'm more a \"behind the scenes\" kind of person. But I did think of something, though. Or rather, Phil mentioned it. My sister-in-law is on some kind of board or committee that evaluates where United Way money goes. I think I'll look into that.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds right up your alley."}, {"instruction": "Yes, it does. And I have one or two other ideas I might look into. But I could do this United Way thing without leaving my job. Rachel only does it a few hours a week.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still thinking of leaving your job?"}, {"instruction": "Ultimately, yes. I'm not in a big hurry, though. I was just really down last week because of my birthday. I'm pretty much over it now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that. What else is on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "I'm going to have a talk with Jake. One gift once in a while--even if it's handmade and very personal--just doesn't do it. We don't talk any more. He used to tell me his history, and his dreams, and his feelings. We used to have spirited discussions about politics and art. We used to thoroughly deconstruct every movie we saw. Now, it's all I can do to engage him in conversation. He's still charming, and romantic, and all that stuff. But it feels like he's just going through the motions, like an actor repeating a familiar role.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still working to lend excitement to the relationship?"}, {"instruction": "As much as I can. I try to think of neat new things to do together, and he does them and acts like he's enjoying it. He might really be. But it's not helping. Besides, fun isn't all there is to a relationship, you need the closeness, too. It's like I can't reach him anymore.", "input": "", "output": "I see. When do you plan to have this conversation?"}, {"instruction": "Soon, I think. Before Sunday.", "input": "", "output": "What's special about Sunday?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing, it's just an arbitrary deadline I set for myself.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know how you're going to approach it?"}, {"instruction": "I'll say pretty much what I just told you, though I want to present it in a more positive light. I don't want to sound like I'm nagging him; I want to start a productive dialogue.", "input": "", "output": "Good luck."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, we've discussed Alex and Jake. What about Katherine?"}, {"instruction": "We've discussed Katherine, too. Remember the United Way thing?", "input": "", "output": "Is there anything else?"}, {"instruction": "Um, not really. I'm feeling pretty good lately, other than my relationship, of course.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Why don't we talk about your father some more then?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I guess that's still the big issue. Okay. Uh, I'm drawing a blank. Why don't you start?", "input": "", "output": "Well, we were talking about closure. You said that since your father effectively disappeared, you didn't feel the relationship ever really ended. You wondered what happened to him and felt you didn't really know how he felt about you."}, {"instruction": "Uh huh. And you reminded me that I did know how he felt...I do know how he felt.  You reminded me why. And that's pretty much settled. I know he loved me, and he didn't intend to abandon me--it just sort of worked out that way. I wish he could have been stronger and stood up to Mama, but then again I know from experience just how hard that can be. Poor Joey can't do it to this day. And I wish he would have gotten back in touch with me after I grew up. Hey, I think I dreamed of him recently.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Just an idea. I woke up with him on my mind and the feeling that I could almost remember the dream. I don't know, maybe it's just because I've been thinking of him so much lately.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, processing goes on even after you leave the office--for you in particular, I've noticed."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. I'll take that as a complement.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome. So do you feel you're closer to getting closure with your father?"}, {"instruction": "Closer, yes. But not there yet.", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't expect that. This has been festering for many years, and you've only been dealing with it for a few short months."}, {"instruction": "A few months? I've been seeing you for almost a year now. When I started, I didn't think it would take more than a few weeks.", "input": "", "output": "This can be a long process. Many people stay in therapy for several years. You're making excellent progress. I don't think you'll be working on this issue much longer."}, {"instruction": "Thanks for the encouragement.", "input": "", "output": "Have you reached a decision on trying to locate him?"}, {"instruction": "I'm still wavering. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "Obviously you feel a strong need for more knowledge on the subject."}, {"instruction": "Obviously. But you've evaded the question. I know you have an opinion. What is it?", "input": "", "output": "What I feel about it isn't important.  Really, it's what you feel about it."}, {"instruction": "That's an evasion, too.  Come on, Doctor Balis.  I'm asking your opinion.  Won't you give that to me?", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I have doubts that whatever you find will help you settle the issues in your own mind. I think it's more important to work on what you feel and deal with your reactions to what happened. This is about you and how you're dealing with the loss. Dredging up more details about the circumstances may not be productive."}, {"instruction": "Are you saying that what's in my mind is the issue, and what might have motivated my father is irrelevant?", "input": "", "output": "Not exactly irrelevant, but not entirely essential, either. What's causing your discomfort is your reaction to what happened. I think that's the central issue."}, {"instruction": "I see. Thank you for being straight with me.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, it's not a bad idea. I'm just not convinced it's the most productive course of action."}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay. I'll consider that. Next topic.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "How's that cat of yours?", "input": "", "output": "Much bigger. Still quite a handful."}, {"instruction": "Phil's thinking about a ferret.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that they're legal in California."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I don't think it's a good idea, though. They seem kind of high strung to me. I'm afraid it would be getting into his supplies or scampering off somewhere all the time.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, I guess that's it. I'd like to talk more about daddy, but I'm kind of burned out for today.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right. We can start again next week."}, {"instruction": "Uh, no, actually, I'll be in Texas most of next week on business. We'd better just skip it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Then I'll see you the following week, the 25th. All right?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. Keep dry!", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. You too."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. Whoa, careful! Are you okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I'm all right, just a little dizzy sometimes--Post Concussive Syndrome. It's getting better, though.", "input": "", "output": "How did you get a concussion?"}, {"instruction": "I got hit on my way to the Austin airport Thursday morning. Good thing I had a full size car, or I'd be hurt worse.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, my. How did it happen?"}, {"instruction": "The light turned green, I started to go through and got hit by a pickup truck full of firewood. Right in the driver's door. Firewood everywhere! I have a sore shoulder, a bruise on my left hip that's slowly moving through every color of the rainbow, and a short nap that slightly scrambled my brains. It also made me miss my plane. I was an hour from escaping Texas unharmed.", "input": "", "output": "Did you feel unsafe in Texas?"}, {"instruction": "No, no. That line gets a laugh at the office, though.", "input": "", "output": "Have you seen a neurologist?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I got to ride in an ambulance. I don't recommend it. They put me in a neck brace and strapped me to a stiff wooden board so I couldn't move a muscle. Now, that was scary. The guy finally let me move my arms so I wouldn't feel totally helpless. Did you ever have a neurological assessment? Of course you have; you've given them, you're a medical doctor. When I first came to, I actually couldn't remember my name for a minute. So they took me to the high tech trauma center. I got X-rays, I got a CAT scan, I even got an eye exam. I think the doctors were thrilled to get a chance to play with all their toys. They finally let me go Friday afternoon. They gave me this swanky cane, though.", "input": "", "output": "How long will you need to use it?"}, {"instruction": "Up to three weeks, they said. My vision is almost better already, so I don't think it'll be that long. I still don't feel good about driving. Jake has been driving me around.", "input": "", "output": "On the motorcycle?"}, {"instruction": "Oh my, no. He has an old junker for when it rains. But right now, he's in my Jaguar. Took to it right quick, too.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did you have that conversation you were planning?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, no, not yet.", "input": "", "output": "No?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the timing never seemed right. You know that Saturday was Valentine's Day. He was so amazingly romantic. He brought over a suitcase full of stuff and made a fondue. It wasn't that good--Jake is no chef--but it's the thought that counts. There was bread, and shrimp, and wine, and all kind of things. It was like that first picnic, remember the Mud Flats?", "input": "", "output": "I remember."}, {"instruction": "And he rented \"The American President.\" It's one of the most romantic movies of all time, in my opinion.", "input": "", "output": "So you couldn't bring up your dissatisfaction with the relationship."}, {"instruction": "No. And now that he's spending so much time taking care of my injuries, it would seem ungrateful. So we'll see. I have been dropping hints, though. We've had some decent conversations lately. I almost told him about you.", "input": "", "output": "He still doesn't know you're in therapy?"}, {"instruction": "No. I'm...I don't know. I guess I'm a little embarrassed to be seeing a psychiatrist. It's not the image I have of myself.", "input": "", "output": "I understand, many people feel that way. You don't want to admit a weakness."}, {"instruction": "Exactly.", "input": "", "output": "But it's not a weakness to be working on your issues, Katherine. It's a strength. You have the courage and perseverance to tackle the tough issues and work your way through them. You're not showing weakness by coming here; you're showing strength."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I can see that.", "input": "", "output": "So do you plan on talking to Jake before you go away together?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I'm not sure. I suppose I should.", "input": "", "output": "I agree."}, {"instruction": "Well, that's a few weeks away, anyway. Jeez, I hope I'm recovered by then. I'd hate to have one of those dizzy spells while I'm skiing.", "input": "", "output": "I'm concerned about that, too. I hope you won't push it."}, {"instruction": "I'll be careful. Oh, shit, there's another one.", "input": "", "output": "What? Oh. I can't recall seeing a crow perch on my window ledge before. I get pigeons occasionally, but never a crow."}, {"instruction": "Hey! Get out! Go! Damn bird.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine?"}, {"instruction": "Sorry. The damn crows are freaking me out.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know exactly. When I woke up from the wreck, the field was covered with them. I didn't see them before, and I couldn't have been out for more than a minute. They were just sitting there, silent, a shiny black sea of feathers. Several people commented on them, too. No one seemed to have seen them arrive. It was spooky. I felt like they had come for me personally. When the fire truck pulled up, they all flew off at once, a great black cacophony of beating wings and cawing voices. All except this one sitting on a piece of firewood in the road, looking at me. It just stared at me, ignoring the siren. Freaky.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And since then, I've seen them all over. I don't remember seeing crows in San Francisco before.", "input": "", "output": "I've noticed them once in a while."}, {"instruction": "Well, this is different. It's like they're following me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure it's just perception. You first noticed them during a traumatic episode, and they made a big impression on you. Now you're extra sensitive to them, so you're noticing them where they may have been before and just didn't register. Your mind has them linked to the trauma, so their presence is uncomfortable for you. It's a common post-traumatic reaction."}, {"instruction": "Post-traumatic? Come on, I had a wreck. It's not like I was in Vietnam.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not making a clinical diagnosis. But you did have a psychological trauma, and you're likely to show some symptoms. Probably they'll fade just as your concussion will fade. We could talk about it some, though. It must have been a frightening experience."}, {"instruction": "It was. I'm sorry; sometimes...lately, I can't think very fast. Could you tell me again why the crows are so scary?", "input": "", "output": "No need to apologize; your concussion is likely to affect your cognition, too. I believe that since you woke to the startling view of crows, you've become more sensitive to them--more aware of their presence--so now you notice them more, even though they may not actually be around any more than before. Plus, your mind has linked the crows to the accident--they serve as a trigger: when you see a crow, you're reminded of the accident, if not cognitively, then emotionally. So you notice them more, and you have a strong emotional reaction to them."}, {"instruction": "So seeing crows makes me feel like I'm in the wreck again?", "input": "", "output": "Well, it brings back memories of the wreck."}, {"instruction": "And I notice them more because of the wreck.", "input": "", "output": "Exactly."}, {"instruction": "Vicious circle, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "It can be. But we can break it, with a little work. Do you want to talk about it?"}, {"instruction": "May as well. But are you going to be able to explain the fact that they're in my dreams, too? And also that visit we just had?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure that crow in the window was just a coincidence. As for the dreams, that's just part of the same syndrome. But that's a good place to start. Tell me about the dreams."}, {"instruction": "Um, I don't have any real details, just images. This morning when I woke up, I actually said, \"Aw, jeez, the fucking crows again.\" I just...I don't know. It's real vague, like dreams can be. Maybe they're watching me, maybe I just notice them. Maybe I'm really dreaming about the wreck and the crows is all I can remember when I wake up.", "input": "", "output": "That's likely. Recurring dreams are common. They'll probably stay with you until your mind is finished processing the event. Why don't you tell me more about the accident?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. I remember noticing this big empty field as I was waiting for the light to change. I thought about how you don't see that sort of thing around here. Texas is so flat. Then the light changed, and I was trying to remember the rest of the way to the airport. Here's a part I'm not sure of: I think I remember seeing the truck coming toward me from the corner of my eye. But then again, maybe I made that part up to fill in the gap.", "input": "", "output": "Let's go with that as a true memory for now."}, {"instruction": "Okay. So I barely had time to register this truck coming straight for me, and the next thing I knew I woke up all fuzzy-headed and not seeing straight. There was a crowd of people all around already. I was real confused, trying to figure out where I was and what had happened. I looked around and saw the truck glued to my door and firewood all over the place. And then, I heard people talking about the crows. So I looked up, and this field was covered with crows. They just stood there, milling around, not going anywhere, for maybe five minutes. Someone got in and was talking to me, and I remember I couldn't carry on a conversation. It was like my thoughts just wouldn't form right in my mind. I couldn't even tell him my name for a while, and I never could remember his. And I'm usually pretty good about that.", "input": "", "output": "That was the concussion. Go on, you're doing fine."}, {"instruction": "So he talked to me for a while, didn't let me get out of the car. I couldn't stop looking at the crows; there were so many of them, and I could still hear people commenting on them. I wanted to get out and get a closer look but the guy didn't let me. Then the fire truck came, sirens blaring. Damn those things are loud. Then the crows took off, and that was louder still. I thought my head would burst--all the sirens and flapping and cawing. God...", "input": "", "output": "Here's the tissues."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I don't think I cried then. I don't think I was really feeling anything at the time.", "input": "", "output": "What are you feeling now?"}, {"instruction": "Um, just overwhelmed, I guess. Scared, maybe.", "input": "", "output": "What are you afraid of?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not, really. It's just a scary thing to be in a wreck and have all that going on. I guess I'm just feeling what I didn't feel then.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. Go on."}, {"instruction": "Um, how's our time?", "input": "", "output": "Our time is fine, don't worry about it."}, {"instruction": "Uh...well, then the fireman got in, put that collar on me, and told me not to move. He put a bandage on my head. Then the police arrived--more sirens. Then the ambulance. They put this kind of corset on me to get me out of the car, then onto that board. In the ambulance, I got a pop quiz. I remembered my name, and my birthday, and where I was going, but not my address or my flight number. That was scary--not knowing where I live. So we went to the hospital. The guy, the paramedic I mean, gave me an IV while we were moving. I didn't think you could do that in a moving vehicle, but this guy was pretty good. In fact, everyone was really professional and caring. And I already told you about the hospital.", "input": "", "output": "You told me some. I'd like some more details."}, {"instruction": "Aren't we out of time?", "input": "", "output": "Well, yes. But you're doing so well, I didn't want to interrupt the flow. Do you feel you're at a good stopping point now?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. All the really weird stuff happened before I got in the ambulance.", "input": "", "output": "How are you feeling now?"}, {"instruction": "I'm okay.", "input": "", "output": "I don't want you to leave here if you're still distressed. You can stay a while."}, {"instruction": "I'm fine. I'll be okay.", "input": "", "output": "Is Jake coming to get you?"}, {"instruction": "No, I couldn't have him come here. Phil's picking me up, we're going out to supper.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. We'll work on this some more next week, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thank you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome. Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "Oh boy, where do I begin? As you can see, I still have the cane. But I think I'll dump it at the end of this week; the dizzy spells are few and far between now. I've started driving again. Jeff has been picking up a lot of the slack around the office while I've been slow on my mental feet, and I've realized something--I'm still doing a lot of the stuff I used to do when I was in his position. I'm supposed to be the idea person now, the big thinker, the one who jets off to Dallas or Redmond or New York and makes the big deals. Instead, I've been tying myself to the office, doing the little bookkeeping shit I should have sloughed off on my assistant weeks ago. And I'm still managing the office, which Frank never did. Plus, Jeff mentioned he was glad to have a little more responsibility, more challenge. So I'm giving it to him. I'm going to become more the executive, less the manager.", "input": "", "output": "Good for you. Do you feel comfortable in that role?"}, {"instruction": "Well, see, you've done it again. I'm not entirely sure I do. I like being in control, managing, planning, organizing. I'm not that sure of what exactly I'm supposed to be doing as a chief executive. Maybe it's just a transition period. Or maybe it's not really my role to do a lot. Maybe I just take the fall when things go wrong.", "input": "", "output": "Do you really think that's the case?"}, {"instruction": "Well, a little. Anyway, I don't mind; I'm getting paid well for it. I don't know, maybe I'm just in an adjustment period.", "input": "", "output": "Could be."}, {"instruction": "But I do know I shouldn't be managing the office. I was checking up on a few projects one day last week, and this woman was there from some other department, and she kept looking at me like I was crazy. And it got me thinking: I'm not supposed to be dealing with the staff. That's why I have an assistant. It seems like I failed to learn that lesson from Frank. But I've learned it now.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "Okay, other office news. Alex came to see me at work last week. That caused quite a stir. Bold-ass gossips in that office. They were whispering at each other and casting furtive glances our way, all but pointing fingers. And they knew I could see them. To think I hired some of those people. I swear they weren't like that in the interviews.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure they weren't. Job interviews are tricky; people try to only show you what they want you to see."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, that's Jeff's problem now.", "input": "", "output": "So it is."}, {"instruction": "So Alex came to ask when I was going to see the baby. He's so excited about his new little brother, you'd think it was his son. Alex is so sweet. You should have seen how concerned he was when he saw the cane and heard about the concussion.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like he's a good friend."}, {"instruction": "Yes, he is. So with Larraine asking to see me, and Alex so excited about little Aaron, I went to Larraine's home. Larraine nearly died from the delivery. I didn't think things like that happened any more. Anyway, I guess her near-death experience made an impression on her. This was not the same woman who went off on me right in front of her vice president. She was kind, apologetic, and full of remorse. She explained that she was afraid I was taking her son away from her, threatening her motherhood somehow. Doctor Balis, does pregnancy make a woman insane?", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't say that exactly. There is a lot of stress associated with carrying a baby, quite a weight of responsibility. Couple that with a massive influx of hormones and odd chemical changes in the body associated with supporting another life--I think some psychological effects are inevitable. Plus, there may be other stressors in Larraine's life that you know nothing about."}, {"instruction": "Could be. Or it could be that she realizes that she has to come back to SII at some point and doesn't want to be on my bad side.", "input": "", "output": "You don't think she was sincere in her apologies?"}, {"instruction": "It's hard to tell. It's not like I know her very well. I've met the raving bitch she was a few months ago and then this sweet new mother now. Two different people. And neither may be the real Larraine Rozzi. I think I'll let time be the judge.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds wise."}, {"instruction": "But she let me hold the baby.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Encouraged me, actually. Female bonding ritual, I suppose. But that baby is small. I mean, really tiny. It's amazing something that little can be a human being and function independently. Well, you know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Didn't you know your niece and nephew when they were babies?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but they were full term. This made me think of them, though. It's about time for a visit. You know, Doctor Balis, I really like kids, but older kids who are just starting to really realize how much world there is out there and wanting to explore it. It's the adventure of discovery; I want to be part of that. Which brings me to the big news of the week.", "input": "", "output": "And that is?"}, {"instruction": "Jake. God, what an asshole. Sweet, lovable, generous, kind asshole. Turns out he's the one who bought Alex's paintings.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. He was going to give them to me for my birthday last Monday.", "input": "", "output": "Why so late?"}, {"instruction": "Because he fucked up. He thought it was March 2nd, instead of February. At least he got the day right.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So he was going to give me these three paintings for my birthday, but after hearing me talk about volunteer work and the arts and children, he decided to donate them, in my name, to this new youth arts center out near the park. Oh, don't let me forget the park, there's a story there, too.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Wasn't that sweet? And stupid? I can't decide if I should be pissed or thrilled.", "input": "", "output": "Why would you be angry?"}, {"instruction": "It's so manipulative. He jerks poor Alex around, spinning this tale about an anonymous buyer. Then, he puts my name on a gift I didn't give. And Alex is going to think I did it out of some sense of pity or charity. Where does he get off fucking with our lives--and our relationship--like that?", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I can understand all that. So why would you be thrilled?"}, {"instruction": "Well, mostly because he heard me. I've been talking about wanting to get into volunteer work with children and about my interest in theater and the arts, and he put two and two together and came up with three, as it turns out. But he was trying to do something that fit in with what I wanted and that would make me happy. He was damn clumsy about it, but he was trying. I have to give him that.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever have that discussion with him?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah...well, sort of. It kind of all came out at once. See, he presented me with this letter of appreciation from the Bay Area Youth Arts Alliance at supper Monday, for my \"birthday.\" So of course I was mad that he screwed up my birthday so bad. And then, I was mad that he went behind my back and jerked Alex around. See, he was motivated by charity for Alex. He thought he could make Alex happy and me too, at the same time. But it had nothing to do with Alex's work; he just felt sorry for him. So then, as I'm building up this good head of steam, I decide that since we're arguing anyway, it would be a perfect time to bring up this matter of communication. I guess that wasn't the best judgment on my part. And of course, it backfired on me. It turned out that the idea to donate Alex's paintings was sparked by listening to me. But that just happened recently, as I was making serious efforts to engage him in conversation. And that was a real effort at times, too.", "input": "", "output": "So it sounds like you two had a serious argument."}, {"instruction": "Well, there wasn't much argument to it, really. He didn't have much to say. He was so proud of what he had done, how he had figured out this wonderful gesture, and then it all went to hell on him. And there I was ranting about how he never listens, and he had come up with all this by listening to me. Finally, I just sent him home. And he was like, \"Uh? I thought I might spend the night.\" I was thinking, \"Get a clue! I'm pissed. You're not getting any tonight.\"", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "But I feel kind of bad now. I know he's confused. And I guess I was kind of hard on him.", "input": "", "output": "You haven't spoken since then?"}, {"instruction": "It was just two days ago. I think I'll call him tonight.", "input": "", "output": "And say what?"}, {"instruction": "Apologize for blindsiding him, to start with. Then, try to have a rational conversation about it--explain exactly why I got so upset.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel your anger was justified?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe not with the intensity I showed. But I think I had a right to be upset. He was pretty clumsy about it. If he'd have stopped to think, he would have realized how insulting this will be to Alex and that I might not appreciate him putting me in an awkward position of having to explain to Alex about his paintings. His heart was in the right place, but that doesn't excuse his actions. Does it?", "input": "", "output": "Does it?"}, {"instruction": "Not to me. He could have thought this through better. He's not stupid.", "input": "", "output": "Have you told Alex?"}, {"instruction": "Not yet. I know I have to before he finds out for himself and gets the wrong idea. I hate to do it, though; he has such a high regard for Jake right now. He's so happy that his paintings sold. This is totally going to spoil it for him.", "input": "", "output": "But you have to tell him."}, {"instruction": "Yes, of course I do. You know, one good thing may come from this.", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't know about that arts council. I went by there yesterday. Hey, how do you like this--three days in a row without rain? So I went by there, and there they were, three original Rozzies. And the place has art classes and dance. And they're building a theater. They coordinate with local schools, and they need volunteers. I'm doing that United Way committee, but that's only two nights a month. So I think I'll look into this. And it's something Alex might get into, too.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So do you know how you're going to approach Alex about what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And I know how I'm going to approach Jake, too. I feel one of those long, heavy conversations coming on. The kind that go on until one-thirty in the morning and leave you totally exhausted. And I've got a meeting in the morning--marketing, engineering, Lloyd of course, some others. Something big's coming down. Maybe I'll put Jake off until tomorrow.", "input": "", "output": "Don't put it off too long."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know, it's boiling right now, and I have to strike while the iron is hot. Tomorrow, I promise.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Time is almost up. Do you have anything else?"}, {"instruction": "Um, seems like I did. Shit, yeah! You were going to let me forget my park story.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, so I was. I'm sorry. Please tell."}, {"instruction": "I went to the Arts Alliance yesterday, which I told you is near the park...", "input": "", "output": "Golden Gate Park?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Then, I decided I had some time to kill and some things to think about, so I thought I'd walk around the park, totally forgetting the damn thing's three miles long. And of course, there were crows. They're with me all the time now, watching through the windows at work, calling to me from the trees outside my house. And every time one calls to me, I think of my father. Not sad thoughts, not particularly happy, either; he just sort of comes to mind. So the crows are in the park, and I see this man looking at them. And he saw me watching him, and he said the weirdest thing. He gestured to the crows and said, \"Are they yours?\"", "input": "", "output": "That is odd."}, {"instruction": "But he seemed pleased by the idea. Turns out he's a professor of anthropology at U.C. Berkeley. He told me that many cultures consider crows, or more properly ravens, to be messengers from the spirit world. Also, in Native American lore, the raven is a powerful totem--a spirit guide--involved in helping one find a true path, a true purpose in life.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So that's something to think about. The ravens don't bother me any more. Now, I'm wondering what they've come to tell me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How are you feeling about the accident lately?"}, {"instruction": "No problem. I've started driving again, and it hasn't bothered me. I do feel pretty lucky to be alive, and I'm thinking I may as well be doing something with my life, since it could come to an abrupt end at any time. But the...uh, the psychic aftermath of the wreck is not that bad anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Good. But there may still be something there. We could talk about it some more if you want, next week."}, {"instruction": "We'll see. I'll think about it tonight and see if there's any distress left.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. See you next week then?"}, {"instruction": "That's my cue to go. Okay, until next time.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. How are you today?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Got some stuff on my mind.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "Alex. You know, I've noticed that I talk about Alex a lot in here. Does that bother you at all?", "input": "", "output": "No. Why would it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he's your patient, too, after all. I'm just wondering if I tell you stuff about him that he doesn't mention. Would that put you in an uncomfortable position?", "input": "", "output": "Not really. What we deal with in here is about you. When I talk with Alex, we deal with what he brings up. You're two different patients, and I don't have much trouble keeping you separated in my mind."}, {"instruction": "Okay, good. That answers my other question, too.", "input": "", "output": "Which is?"}, {"instruction": "Do you ever feel like you're doing his therapy through me?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you're doing therapy with Alex. Are you?"}, {"instruction": "No, certainly not. I'm not even remotely qualified. I just wonder if you feel like I'm interfering in some way.", "input": "", "output": "No. I don't get that impression at all."}, {"instruction": "Good. What about me? Am I wasting time in here talking about Alex when I could be talking about my own stuff? My father, for instance?", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, I wonder. That's why I asked.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I've only heard you talk about Alex in reference to something that was bothering you. When you stop talking about your issues and start talking about his, it might be time to redirect. But if there's something that concerns you, which also happens to involve Alex, that's fine. He's your friend and is as much a part of your life as Jake or Phil. You can't avoid that part of your life in therapy just because he happens to also be a patient of mine."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thanks. That makes me feel better.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Now, what's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Alex. Or rather Jake. Hold on, let me start at the beginning. I told Alex that Jake had bought his paintings and what he had done with them. His reaction was about what you'd expect. I tried to calm him down and to explain that Jake has a good eye for art and must really appreciate Alex's work to spend his own money on it--you know how tight Jake is. But I'm not sure Alex bought any of it. Alex is a pretty bright kid, and he has a lot of experience for his seventeen years. Finally, he calmed down, but he might have just been humoring me. That was last weekend. I saw Jake yesterday, and he didn't say anything about this. So I guess Alex hasn't confronted him. But I feel like I'm keeping a secret, you know?", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Jake is still telling Alex that an anonymous buyer bought his work, but I told him otherwise. Now Jake's in the dark, not knowing that Alex knows. Should I tell him? But that might put more of a rift in our relationship. On the other hand, when he finds out, that might cause problems, too. And, like sands through the hourglass, these are the Days of Our Lives.", "input": "", "output": "It's an interesting predicament. You've moved from one tight spot--keeping Jake's secret from Alex--to another--keeping Alex's secret from Jake."}, {"instruction": "This sucks. Fuck it. I'm telling Jake tonight. I don't want to be keeping secrets. They're big boys; they can work it out themselves.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like a good philosophy."}, {"instruction": "You know, I want to protect them both. But I just can't be responsible for both their feelings. I have enough trouble handling my own.", "input": "", "output": "You're right. You're not responsible for their feelings. And, in the same breath, they are not responsible for yours."}, {"instruction": "Good. I don't want them to be. But speaking of that, I do think I handled a touchy situation very well this weekend.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you did okay."}, {"instruction": "No, no, I'm talking about another situation. When I took Alex home from the Alliance--he loved it, by the way--there was a process server on his doorstep.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. He had a summons for Alex to testify in a criminal trial. If Alex doesn't talk about this, are you going to feel like he's keeping secrets from you?", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I assure you, what is said between us stays between us. It will not affect how I deal with Alex. This conversation is about you, and I will not apply it to my treatment of Alex."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Sorry, I know you said that already. So the upshot is that he was very upset about the summons. So we talked for a while. And he explained his feelings, and we hashed them over some, and it felt really good. I felt bad about the turmoil he was in, but I felt good that he could confide in me and that I could handle it so well. I didn't try to guess his feelings, I didn't lecture him about doing the right thing. When he asked my opinion, I gave it to him knowing he wouldn't agree. But he accepted it as my opinion and not as an order, and we talked about it. It was great.", "input": "", "output": "You're a good friend to Alex. You can be proud of that."}, {"instruction": "I am. I am proud. But I'm more proud that he trusts me. He talked to me without hesitation, without fear, and he was totally open. And it was easy. I was just being me. All the time I've known Alex, I've just been me. I wasn't trying to be any way in particular. He just likes me the way I happen to be. And his friends like me. And at the Alliance, I talked to several teenagers and had no trouble carrying on a conversation. And they didn't seem to mind that I was twice their age. We related. How do you like that? I relate to the next generation. Without trying. I can use that.", "input": "", "output": "You can use that? How?"}, {"instruction": "Just how I've been saying--working with youth through art. If I can help kids to trust just a little bit, and help them to express themselves just a little, and help them feel better about themselves...I don't know, the world will be a better place. At least some people will be happier, more at peace. That has to be a good thing.", "input": "", "output": "Certainly. But what about you?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "You've described how others will feel better. How will you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I'll feel useful, like I make a difference. Now, I make money. I make people rich. Take this project I'm working on now, it'll make things easier for a lot of people in this society. But I'm not involved with that part of it. My part is to use it to make a few people richer. Not that that's a bad thing. I finally found a way to get some personal satisfaction out of that. The wealth I help create provides security. That's why I'm so pleased with the job I did on the pension fund; even if Social Security goes down the tubes, no one who retires from SII will have to worry about their next meal. I've seen to that, and I'll continue to see to it.", "input": "", "output": "So helping other people out and helping society as a whole gives you a personal feeling of satisfaction?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, exactly. I feel good about it. It makes me feel worthwhile.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have any feeling of obligation? Do you feel like you have to take care of other people?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? No. I have to take care of myself. I'm not taking care of any one else. That's why I'm not keeping Alex's secret. And that's why I didn't keep Jake's secret. I like to help, that's all. I don't want to carry these kids. I just want to give them a little boost so they can carry themselves. I get a personal feeling of satisfaction from that.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I think that's wonderful. I'm very pleased to hear that you've found a purpose that satisfies you."}, {"instruction": "You think I'm headed the right way?", "input": "", "output": "Absolutely. I think what you want to do is a wonderful, useful thing. And I think your motivations are sound. You should be proud."}, {"instruction": "Do you think daddy would be proud of me?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure he would be."}, {"instruction": "I can't wait to tell Phil. I told him I saw the place, but he hasn't been down there yet. And I haven't told him I intend to become involved. I think he'll be proud, too.", "input": "", "output": "Is that important to you? Your brother's and your father's approvals?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah, they are. I'd do it even if they didn't approve, because I know it's right and it's what I want to do. But I feel better knowing they'll be proud of me, too. Doesn't everyone want approval? Particularly from their fathers?", "input": "", "output": "Certainly. It's just that some people are motivated purely by that to the exclusion of what they want for themselves."}, {"instruction": "Not me. I've been taking care of myself for too long. I took care of me and my little brother from when daddy left until...well, until Phil moved to Charleston, I guess. Until he didn't need me any more. I guess I told you Mama pretty much took care of Joey and left me and Phil on our own. Emotionally, I mean.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you talked about that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, I'm through being responsible for other people. Until I have kids, at least. Unless, I mean. Unless I have kids.", "input": "", "output": "Is that something you want?"}, {"instruction": "I've thought about it. There's some appeal there. I'll have to think about it some more. Of course, I'd want to be married first. Not that I'm old-fashioned, just that I think a child should have two parents. One doesn't leave you well-rounded enough. Neither does the half-parent that I had. I don't want a fucked-up kid, you know? My parents divorced, so did Jake's. I don't think Alex's were ever married. And look at us. I want my child to grow up well adjusted and sure of himself. Like Phil.", "input": "", "output": "But Phil had the same parents you did."}, {"instruction": "Okay, then he's the exception. How did we start talking about this, anyway? I'm talking like I've already decided. I haven't.", "input": "", "output": "I think it bears some discussion. Obviously, you've given it some thought."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and I'm not done thinking. But now's not really the time.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's almost five. Oh, hey, I wanted to ask: how can I have more dreams?", "input": "", "output": "More? Why do you want more dreams?"}, {"instruction": "Not more, maybe, but clearer. I think something's happening in my dreams. Maybe the ravens are bringing me dreams, I don't know. But I can't remember them. I just get vague images--flying, an airplane, the ravens, and, for some reason, Christmas cookies. I wake up thinking I'm smelling Christmas cookies.", "input": "", "output": "That's interesting."}, {"instruction": "So I was wondering if maybe you have some ideas on how to have more vivid, more rememberable dreams. Rememberable? Memorable? Easier to remember, I mean.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. Let me think on that a minute. Are you having any trouble sleeping? When you fall asleep, are you staying asleep?"}, {"instruction": "No. My sleep is fine.", "input": "", "output": "Are the dreams disturbing?"}, {"instruction": "No. I just want to remember them. I think there may be something there.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Try this. Go to bed with a purpose in mind: \"Tonight, I will remember one dream.\" Don't worry about which one at first, just work on that. Give it a few nights. If that works, you can move on to more dreams per night or to dreaming specific ones. Also, keep a paper and pen by the bed. If you wake up at night from a dream, write it down right away or you're likely to forget it by morning. The same thing in the morning. When you wake up, ask yourself if you remember any dreams and write them down immediately before you even get up."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thanks, I'll try that.", "input": "", "output": "I'd be interested to hear any dreams you do remember, if you want to share them with me."}, {"instruction": "I'll probably do that. Brush up on your Freud, Doc, you may have some interpretation to do.", "input": "", "output": "I will. See you next week, Katherine. Good luck."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. How are you this week?"}, {"instruction": "Not bad, not bad. How about yourself?", "input": "", "output": "I'm okay. You seem to be in a good mood."}, {"instruction": "I am. Listen, do you play the market at all?", "input": "", "output": "I have some mutual funds. Why?"}, {"instruction": "I was just wondered if you kept up with the financial news at all. You know, Reuters Internet, the Wall Street Journal.", "input": "", "output": "Just what I hear on the evening news. What are you getting at?"}, {"instruction": "Well, if you're interested, maybe I'll bring you some clippings. So, on to other things.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine..."}, {"instruction": "I've been talking to Jake.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Things are settling down. I understand that he was trying to be nice to Alex and to me. He may have been manipulative, but he didn't mean to be. I mean, he wasn't malevolent. And he did listen to me, after all. He was trying to do things right, to make me happy, and I lit into him like a rabid dog. I feel guilty about it. He really didn't deserve that.", "input": "", "output": "He didn't?"}, {"instruction": "No. I really let him have it. Anyway, I apologized. Poor guy--he thought he was doing all this wonderful stuff, and it just backfired on him. He was trying to be romantic, like in the beginning. I shouldn't have yelled at him, I should have just explained how he hurt me and probably Alex. So I apologized, and we talked. We talked about thinking these things through before acting, and about being direct instead of going to all these elaborate lengths to surprise me, and about our relationship, and how I've been feeling lately that the magic is slipping away.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How did that go?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the first discussion was trying. We went round and round, trying not to get angry or defensive, rehashing the same things. But since then, it's been getting better. I'm starting to appreciate that he's trying to please me, and he's starting to understand that I can't be bought like that. I'm gaining respect for his efforts, and he's gaining respect for my independence.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like progress."}, {"instruction": "It is.", "input": "", "output": "Are you pleased with it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes and no. It's nice that he's trying so hard and all. But on the other hand, why does it have to be such an effort? He works hard to be the man I want, and I work hard to appreciate it. Should it be so much work?", "input": "", "output": "It's a common myth that good relationships just happen, like magic. Some effort has to be put into making any relationship last."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I can see that. We're different people, we didn't exactly grow up together, so we have to make some allowances for that. That takes some effort, some give and take, some understanding, and some looking the other way. Sure.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "And I still don't know if it's worth it. A good relationship with a good man will be worth the effort. But is this it? I mean, god, if he has to work so hard to hear what I'm saying, if he has to struggle to find ways to express himself, I don't think I can respect that. If I was getting a lot of satisfaction from this, it would be worth the effort--a good return on a reasonable investment. But this feels more like a money pit, like constantly struggling to make a house livable, and never getting to just relax and enjoy the view from the parlor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So I'll give it a little more time. He really does seem to love me, and I think I love him still. It does still feel really great to wake up with him there beside me.", "input": "", "output": "So you've resumed sexual relations?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. He's spent a couple of nights. The first time, it was just because we were up until two tiredly hashing things out. Then last weekend, we cuddled and held all night. We haven't had sex since the argument. I'm not punishing him--I don't want to use sex as a weapon or a prize, that would make me feel like a prostitute. But I just don't feel right about it until things get settled.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I'm glad to hear you're not withholding sex as punishment."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I hate that. Sex should be given, or not, based on how you feel. If you use it to punish or reward behavior, that's tantamount to just selling it. That's sick. I can't respect any woman who does that. And from what I hear, there's a lot of them.", "input": "", "output": "Indeed. I'm still not clear--are you still considering leaving Jake?"}, {"instruction": "I've thought about it. But I don't want to do it because I'm mad. I want to get through this little crisis first and use it as more information to make an informed decision. If I dump him in the middle of this, I'll always wonder if it could have worked out. If I do it...well, in cold blood, so to speak, I can be sure I made a rational decision.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I can't say I approve of your metaphor, but I understand your reasoning."}, {"instruction": "Hey, how do you like that? I'm not worried about being abandoned by a man this time. I'm the one considering doing the abandoning. It's kind of a refreshing turn of events.", "input": "", "output": "I guess you could say that."}, {"instruction": "And I just did. Next topic.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Alex told me he confronted Jake about the paintings. Jake never mentioned it. I brought that up, too. He explained that he didn't want to open that can of worms while all the rest of this was stewing. But he agreed that I was right to tell Alex and that he should have just bought the paintings outright and told him what he was doing with them. Maybe then, Alex would have believed that he wasn't doing it out of charity. And he wasn't, really. He was doing it to please me.", "input": "", "output": "And how are things between you and Alex now?"}, {"instruction": "Fine. And Alex is ready to forgive Jake, as soon as Jake will see him. Jake's been ducking him, trying not to let things get stirred up any more. But I've let him know that's not helping. And I made an excuse to Alex about it, but I'm not comfortable with that, either.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I can imagine."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Enough of this, this is tiring. Page three, as the man says. I'm going to work at the Arts Alliance.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I know you're excited about that."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I am. The director's name is Josh Massey. He was an art teacher at one of the high schools until he got the same feeling I have about doing something for unlucky kids. That's what he calls them, not \"underprivileged\" but \"unlucky.\" I like that. I also like something else he said that jibes right with what I was talking about last time. He said, \"I'm just helping to shovel off some of the shit society has dumped on these kids, so they can get out from under it. After that, they're on their own.\" It's not about supporting them, it's just about helping out a little. His idea is to use art to boost their self-esteem, so they can see they have value and something to contribute to society. He's conducting classes himself, and he's got a couple of music teachers donating their time, and local movie and TV people to help with the theater. The theater, that's where I'm going to work. Alex is working on that right now, too. I'm going to ask Phil if he wants to get involved. I bet he will.", "input": "", "output": "I like the sound of this."}, {"instruction": "Come on down, I think we can fit you in somewhere. Josh is coordinating with San Francisco public schools, and United Way, and Big Brothers and Big Sisters. And he's trying to get something going with the juvenile courts. He's running mostly off a federal grant right now, but I'm going to help him apply to the United Way for money. I'll have to learn something about private fund raising. I might become their financial expert.", "input": "", "output": "You may as well make use of your expertise."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. So I feel pretty good about this.", "input": "", "output": "I'm pleased that you've found a way to put your talents to work for your personal satisfaction. Congratulations."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I'm on my way over there tonight. One more thing before I go, I've been working on the dreams.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, yes. How is that going?"}, {"instruction": "I've used your suggestions, and I've gotten a couple of things. It's mostly about Jake.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that has been on your mind recently."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but that's not what the ravens have brought me. So I looked up Andrew.", "input": "", "output": "Andrew?"}, {"instruction": "Andrew Cullem, the anthropology professor I met in the park.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, yes. Why?"}, {"instruction": "I thought he might know some magic. He's going to help me on a dream quest.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "He's looking into how some cultures encourage dreaming for a purpose. And he'll come up with a ritual or a potion, or maybe both, to help me realize what the ravens are telling me.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, this doesn't sound like you. You're planning on taking some \"potion\" to extract meanings from your dreams?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I know it's all hokum. I took an anthropology class in college; I know that curses work only because people think they work. You'd call it the placebo effect. But just because the remedy is bogus, doesn't mean the cure is not real. All I'm looking for is some kind of focus, something to focus my mind on what I'm missing. If it takes a ritual to do that, fine. I'll take what I can get. I'll combine it with what you've taught me and see where it leads.", "input": "", "output": "But I'd like to..."}, {"instruction": "Besides, I made a new friend. Andrew is fascinating, if a bit...well, professorial. He has a different take on the world and society. And he's educated. I don't have to watch my vocabulary around him. And he always understands what I'm saying the first time.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's a good thing. But about this potion..."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Well, I have to be going. See you next week. Wish me luck with my dream quest.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine..."}, {"instruction": "I'm not stupid, Doctor. I'll be careful.  And I have your number, too.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Bye, now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. How have you been this week?"}, {"instruction": "Good. I think my mood improves with the weather.", "input": "", "output": "That's not uncommon."}, {"instruction": "No, I guess not.", "input": "", "output": "What's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Did you hear about that shooting in Arkansas yesterday?", "input": "", "output": "The school children? Yes, I did."}, {"instruction": "I heard it on the news yesterday and again this morning. I can't get over it. What a tragedy.", "input": "", "output": "I agree. It's very sad."}, {"instruction": "I've been wondering why it hit so close to home for me. It might be that it happened in a southern state. I hear interviews with the families, and I know those people.  I don't actually know them, but I recognize their accents. And I keep coming back to how young they all were. Those kids were eleven and twelve years old, not just the shooters but the victims, too. Eleven is a significant age for me.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, certainly."}, {"instruction": "That's a shitty age for something like that to happen to you, the survivors, I mean. I think of them--how they watched this happen, lost friends, saw them die right in front of their eyes. Of course, there's no good age for something like that to happen.", "input": "", "output": "But the fact that they were eleven makes it much more personal for you?"}, {"instruction": "Right. I guess that's not surprising, considering that the most formative event in my life happened at that age.", "input": "", "output": "And this is likely to be the most significant event in the survivors' childhoods as well. That gives you a connection to them that you otherwise wouldn't have. And it probably brings you back to when you were eleven."}, {"instruction": "Of course it does. But that's been on my mind lately, anyway. And we'll get to that in a minute, I promise. How about that teacher?", "input": "", "output": "I heard that she got killed shielding one of her students."}, {"instruction": "I'd have done it. I'm sure of it, no doubt about it. I never would have even hesitated. I've been thinking about the people I know--who would have done that and who wouldn't.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "You would. Phil would, without thinking. I'm sure Daddy would. Frank, Mama, Joey, they would. I don't know about Rachel; she'd probably swoon like a properly delicate Southern Rose and be no help to anyone.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I haven't heard you mention Jake."}, {"instruction": "Jake would, but he'd be too busy trying to subdue the shooters. Mister Danger would be charging the woods, trying to be a hero by stopping the kids with guns, and no doubt get himself killed in the effort. But that's just as noble as shielding a little girl. More so, probably--he would have been trying to save the whole group.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "That would be fine with me. I can respect that. I even think I'd be proud of him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And how are things going with Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Getting better. Rather, getting back to normal. We've pretty much settled our differences. He brought over a little hors d'oeuvres plate along with champagne and strawberries, and we made love in the gentlest, sweetest way we'd ever done. Then he pissed me off again.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "The Jackass wrecked his motorcycle. The police called me at work and scared me half to death. I spent all afternoon in the emergency room with him, just to find out he's the luckiest man alive. He hit the intersection too hard in the middle of one of the steeper hills, lost control, and went skidding halfway down the rest of the hill on his back.  He was wearing a leather jacket, and it destroyed the jacket and didn't put a scratch on him. He has some tendon damage in one shoulder--the shoulder probably separated on impact and then slid right back into place.  He also has a small bump on his head. But he didn't even get a road rash.", "input": "", "output": "That does sound lucky. Jake doesn't wear a helmet, does he?"}, {"instruction": "No. He's lucky his brains aren't scattered all over Union Street.", "input": "", "output": "He certainly is."}, {"instruction": "I don't think I can do this anymore, Doctor Balis. There are some good things about this relationship, and Jake's a nice guy and all, but it's not what I want. There's nothing really wrong with him, not fundamentally. No man's going to be perfect, I know that, and Jake's faults are not insurmountable. But he's not \"it.\" You know?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I do. Can you elaborate?"}, {"instruction": "He lacks certain characteristics that I want in a long term partner--like a basic respect for his own life, a broad understanding of culture and how people operate, and--I know this sounds snooty--an advanced education. I want a man for whom I don't have to edit my vocabulary.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't think that's unreasonable. So I'll have to ruminate on it a bit more, but I think this is it. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "I think this is entirely your decision to make."}, {"instruction": "Tell me why I should stay with him.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you tell me?"}, {"instruction": "Inertia, mostly. We have a decent thing, I hate to give it up just because it's not all I'd hoped for. I suppose I can keep my eyes open and wait until I find someone more suited to me.", "input": "", "output": "Would that be fair to Jake?"}, {"instruction": "No, of course not. I'd just be using him for convenience. I wouldn't feel good about that.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What else?"}, {"instruction": "Loneliness. I feel like I'm better off with half a relationship than none at all. But then I run into the same thing--I'd just be stringing him along. It's really kinder to cut him loose and let him look for someone else, than keep him in a hopeless relationship until I'm ready to leave him for another man. Besides, I can be okay on my own. I'm a strong, independent woman. I've taken care of myself for twenty-two years; I don't need a man to make me complete.", "input": "", "output": "Good for you, Katherine. I'm glad I didn't have to point that out."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, me too. So if it's not happening long-term, I should go ahead and give it up right away. Man! I've never ended such a deep relationship before; they've always left me. This is harder than I thought.", "input": "", "output": "It always is. Despite your differences, you have strong feelings for Jake. I'm sure you don't want to hurt him. And the end of a relationship is always sad, no matter the reason or who leaves whom."}, {"instruction": "So I can expect a period of grief from this, too?", "input": "", "output": "I think you can, yes."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Okay.", "input": "", "output": "So when are you going to tell him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, like I said, I want to think about it some more. I have to be sure that this is the right thing to do.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds to me like you've made a decision."}, {"instruction": "Okay, then I need a little time to get used to the idea before I go through with it, all right?", "input": "", "output": "You should take the time you need."}, {"instruction": "I won't string him along too long, I promise. I just have to work up to it a little, okay?", "input": "", "output": "That's fine."}, {"instruction": "All right. Jeez, we've used a lot of time. About the dreams, I spoke to Andrew.", "input": "", "output": "The anthropologist? And what did he say?"}, {"instruction": "The stuff he came up with is not so much about dreaming as visions. What he's familiar with are Native American and South American vision quest rituals, most of which involve peyote.", "input": "", "output": "I was afraid of that."}, {"instruction": "I know you were, and I have to apologize. I was in a hurry to see Alex, and I didn't listen to you last time. Frankly, I didn't understand what you were going on about. It took Philip to explain it to me. \"Gee, Kathy,\" he said. \"Do you think he might have been worried about you taking hallucinogens?\" It hadn't occurred to me. Seems like it should have--it was in my anthropology class in college.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of \"potion\" did you think he would suggest?"}, {"instruction": "I was thinking roots and herbs and stuff. Naive, huh? I feel like an idiot.", "input": "", "output": "Don't be too hard on yourself. College was years ago, and that sort of thing is outside of your experience. At least I assume it is."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, certainly. I smoked a little pot in college, but I didn't like it. It just made me stupid and silly. I never did anything else.", "input": "", "output": "So what did you tell Andrew?"}, {"instruction": "I rejected it out of hand, of course. He understood, and said he didn't think that was my style anyway. He did have some suggestions about lucid dreaming, though. You know, Doctor Balis, Andrew's not the flake you may think he is. He's an intelligent, educated man with a broad life experience.", "input": "", "output": "Has he taken peyote?"}, {"instruction": "Well, sure. He lived with a tribe in Belize for four months. But that doesn't make him some loser drug addict. He's a respected college professor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'm certainly not going to drink this repulsive cactus tea, puke my guts up, and then hallucinate god only knows what. But it intrigued me, so I took a kind of informal poll of my friends to see what they thought.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "Phil is against it. He knows it's not for me, and he doesn't approve of hard drugs anyway. And he knows I hate drugs of all kinds. We have this kind of unspoken agreement--he doesn't smoke pot where I can see him, and I pretend I don't know that he smokes at all. But I'm sure wine and pot are all he does. I remember Mama worrying about Philip moving to San Francisco, fretting that he would get involved with the drug culture in Asbury Park.", "input": "", "output": "Asbury Park? Isn't that in New Jersey?"}, {"instruction": "She meant Haight-Ashbury, of course. Mama doesn't get out much. To her, everything on the west coast is either sixties pot parties or nineties movie deals.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Alex was amazed that I even knew what an illegal drug was. He said he didn't think uppers and hallucinogens were for me. He thought that if I want to enhance my experience, I should just try pot. And Jake was pretty much indifferent. He was concerned for my safety, but he didn't try to dissuade me at all. He's done acid before. He told me about being in a safe place with someone I trusted, but he didn't seem too worried about me.", "input": "", "output": "Did he offer to be there with you?"}, {"instruction": "It didn't come to that. I assured him I wasn't going to do it, and we changed the subject.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So about the dreaming. Andrew wrote down some ideas about how to recognize when I'm in a dream instead of real life and suggested I work with that. He also had a little ritual--that I've been doing before bed--using a raven's feather, sage, and some camomile tea. It's basically praying to the Spirit of the Raven and asking it for guidance. Apparently this is common for American Indians, though being raised as a Baptist myself, I kind of have a hard time with it. But, hey, whatever works.", "input": "", "output": "And is it working?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. I've been remembering all sorts of dreams, using the techniques you gave me. Now I'm doing this ritual and trying to go to sleep with ravens on my mind or, sometimes, Daddy.", "input": "", "output": "You think the message is about your father?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I kind of hope so.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. Katherine, I'm certainly relieved that you're not considering a peyote ritual. I didn't think that was right for you."}, {"instruction": "I agree. I'm sorry I worried you.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right."}, {"instruction": "But I may have made a new friend. An intelligent and educated friend. That's a good thing.", "input": "", "output": "Certainly. Katherine, our time is up. Do you have anything else?"}, {"instruction": "Already? Yes, I have lots of other things I want to talk about. But I guess it can wait. I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Oh, here's some news from the wire services that I pulled from the Internet for you.  I thought you might be interested; you want to keep up with goings on at the company.  Good night.", "input": "", "output": "I do?  Thanks.  Good night."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Well, I talked to Jake.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "And we're getting married!", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. We had a good talk about our relationship and about commitment, and we decided to get married. It's happening in June.", "input": "", "output": "This is a surprise."}, {"instruction": "More than you know. Doctor Balis, what day is it?", "input": "", "output": "It's Wednesday. Why?"}, {"instruction": "Wednesday?", "input": "", "output": "Wednesday, April First...oh."}, {"instruction": "Gotcha!", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you did. I wasn't expecting an April Fool's joke from you."}, {"instruction": "No one does, it's so out of character. That's what makes it so effective. I've been having a blast at work.", "input": "", "output": "I can imagine."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'm through with that for the day. Down to business. I did talk to Jake on Sunday.", "input": "", "output": "How did that go?"}, {"instruction": "Not too bad, actually. I had my mind made up, so I was secure in the knowledge that I could stand my ground. And I handled it pretty well. Have you ever had to fire anyone?", "input": "", "output": "No, I haven't. I'm sure it's not easy."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's never pleasant, but anything gets easier with practice. If you're careful, you can make the employee see that it's the best thing for him and for the company. And if it's not, then you shouldn't be letting him go in the first place.", "input": "", "output": "So you used these arguments with Jake?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I used those skills with Jake. We sat down together and evaluated the relationship, enumerating the strong and weak points, and we agreed that we weren't a long-term prospect. And so we decided that we may as well not bother to continue.", "input": "", "output": "How did he take that?"}, {"instruction": "Fine. Almost too well.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I'm chagrined to find that I'm a little disappointed about how well he took it. He was sad that it had to end, but he said he suspected he wasn't going to be able to hold on to me much longer. He said he was thrilled to be in love with me for a while, but he knew all along that he was out of his league. That's just how he put it. It was all very civil.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So what's disappointing about that?"}, {"instruction": "I think I'd feel better if it would have broken his heart a little. Is that mean?", "input": "", "output": "That depends. How would that have been better?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I'd feel more like it was worth it, like it was more real, like he was as invested in this as I was.", "input": "", "output": "But Jake's lack of investment was part of why you left him."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, okay. I just want to know that losing me is a real loss. That I'm not just another woman to him.", "input": "", "output": "But you're not just another woman. You're a successful, educated, intelligent woman--you have a lot to offer to a man. You're sensitive and caring. You're willing to make a deep investment in the right relationship. These are values you have, that you know about. It seems like Jake's inability to see that was part of the problem."}, {"instruction": "If he can't see what a great thing he had, that's his shortcoming.", "input": "", "output": "Exactly."}, {"instruction": "Wait a minute. He did know; he said so. He said I was a great woman and he was sorry he wasn't able to hold onto me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Jake didn't feel strongly enough to put forth the necessary effort to preserve the relationship?"}, {"instruction": "No, that's not it. We just don't fit. He was trying, too. And we might have made it work. But it would have been just settling, for both of us. Neither of us is the other's ideal mate. But I still feel a loss.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about that."}, {"instruction": "It was a comfortable relationship. But I didn't expect to be sad after it was over. I thought it would just end. Now, I find I miss him.", "input": "", "output": "Are you having second thoughts?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really. I know I did the right thing. I guess I don't really miss Jake as much as the relationship. Actually, I suppose I won't be missing him at all. We agreed that just because we're not meant to be a couple doesn't mean we don't like each other. So we might hang out together some time. I did enjoy the hang gliding, and hiking. We might do some more of that stuff together.", "input": "", "output": "So you're still friends."}, {"instruction": "I hope so. If I can pull it off.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever had this opportunity before?"}, {"instruction": "No. I've only had the one other serious relationship. Oh, hey. I wonder why I didn't notice that before?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Back in college, I was in love with this guy named Andrew. This man I just met, his name is Andrew, and he's associated with a college. What a coincidence. Or is it a pattern?", "input": "", "output": "Do you see Andrew as a romantic interest?"}, {"instruction": "Gee, I don't think so. I never considered it.", "input": "", "output": "Is he much like your previous Andrew?"}, {"instruction": "Not much. Not at all, really. That one was more like Jake--adventurous and athletic. Okay, forget it. I got dependent on that first Andrew, and he took off for an adventure. I didn't get dependent on Jake, and I dumped him. And we may still be friends. And the new Andrew is nothing like either of them. So I'm not following a pattern, never mind.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So are you happy with how things are now with Jake?"}, {"instruction": "So far. It wasn't as ugly as it could have been. And we may remain friends. That would be nice.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "Okay. So, I'm still learning the lessons of Frank. I've moved all the day-to-day office responsibilities to Jeff, and I'm even going to get him involved in the upcoming insurance renegotiation. Now I know why executives are so hard to reach in the office.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Because they're not there. If there's nothing big on the burner, there's nothing to do. So they play golf, they vacation, they network. Right now, there's this one big project that's been taking a lot of time...this reminds me, I have another clipping for you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, what is this about?"}, {"instruction": "Well, ask yourself: why do executives at a company suddenly start buying all its stock?  Why does a company burn through its cash reserves in its profit sharing plan to buy its own stock?", "input": "", "output": "That's not what I was talking about. Why this sudden interest in my knowing what SII is up to in the market?"}, {"instruction": "I'm just trying to do you a favor. You've done so much for me, I'd like to be able to do something for you, too. This could be a tremendous buying opportunity.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Are you taking advantage of this?"}, {"instruction": "I can't. I know what's going on; it would be insider trading. But I haven't told you anything, I've just shown you articles that are already in print and are public knowledge.  if you read the papers and make the decision on your own...", "input": "", "output": "I see. Thank you for the advice. I'll make this decision on my own."}, {"instruction": "Good. So I was talking about work. Once this project is completed, I'll have plenty of time on my hands. I'll network, I'll work at the Alliance. And I've discovered Social Venture Partners. It's a socially responsible, philanthropic, venture capital firm. They teach people how to be philanthropists and also provide venture capital for socially responsible businesses. I think I'll join.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds good."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I think Daddy would like it--his daughter is using her wealth and expertise to help out society.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure he would. Katherine, this is not the first time you've mentioned how your father would feel about what you're doing with your life. I think this bears further investigation."}, {"instruction": "You do, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. It seems to be a recurring theme. Why do you think it continues to be important to you to have your father's approval?"}, {"instruction": "I thought we covered this. It's natural to want approval, particularly from people who are important to you.", "input": "", "output": "Certainly. But I sense there's more to this than that."}, {"instruction": "Okay, there probably is. But I don't think there's time for that right now. Next time, okay?", "input": "", "output": "I'm going to hold you to that."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Do you think I should play my April Fool's joke on Alex?", "input": "", "output": "Maybe you should feel him out a little first."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he does tend to come in here kind of tense. Okay, until next time.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Pretty good. Hey, that's my tie!", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it is. I'm sure I've worn it before."}, {"instruction": "I guess I've never noticed.", "input": "", "output": "I wear it frequently; I like this tie. Katherine, last time we agreed to talk about your continuing concern with your father's approval."}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah...well, I think that's kind of solved.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I've been dreaming about him.", "input": "", "output": "You have?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I'm thrilled, it's really been prodigious. The rituals worked. I developed this bedtime ritual with the tea, and the burning sage, and a sort of meditation, and I combined it with the recall and directed dreaming techniques you suggested. Success! I've been doing it for weeks, but it didn't really start to work until I started sleeping alone on a regular basis.", "input": "", "output": "Congratulations. What did you get?"}, {"instruction": "Just what I wanted: Daddy. We've had a series of long, illuminating talks.", "input": "", "output": "A series? You mean on consecutive nights?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I told you it was big. I could write a series of essays about it. I can hear myself now on \"This American Life\" or \"Sound and Spirit.\" \"Interviews with Daddy,\" by Katherine Lippard. In fact, Andrew wants me to dictate it all as a case study in paranormal phenomena. He has a psychologist friend--sorry, parapsychologist--who is very interested. But I don't think I'm ready for that yet.", "input": "", "output": "What's paranormal about it?"}, {"instruction": "Andrew believes that I might be communicating with my father's actual spirit.", "input": "", "output": "Channeling the dead?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And what do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I'm trying to be open-minded, so I don't want to totally discount the possibility. But it does seem a little far-fetched. It's not like I transcended this spiritual plane, I just focused my dreams a little.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I've altered my state of consciousness more profoundly with jazz and gin, and I've never seen dead relatives in the haze above the tenor sax.", "input": "", "output": "So what do you think is happening?"}, {"instruction": "I guess it's me. My subconscious is revealing things I know to be true but haven't been able to convince myself of yet. Does that sound too Freudian?", "input": "", "output": "If it's not explicitly sexual, it's not really that Freudian. More Jungian."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Oh, well. Anyway, let me tell you how it all started. I've been getting pictures of ravens. So in a lucid dreaming exercise, I've been asking them what they wanted. I did this all the time, awake or not, so that it would become automatic. It's been pretty weird asking every raven I see what it has to tell me. I got some strange looks. More than one person stopped and asked, in all seriousness, what the raven said back.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not surprised. We are in San Francisco."}, {"instruction": "Yes, indeed. So one night, I was dreaming, and I asked the raven what it had to tell me. It told me to follow it--not in words, I just knew that's what it wanted. So I did, and it flew over this hedge maze. I went in, but then I couldn't see my guide any longer. So I wandered around this maze for what felt like hours, making no progress. When I woke up, I realized I needed a guide that I could see on the ground. I thought about who or what I could bring into the dream to help me, and the best idea I could come up with was you. I hope you don't mind.", "input": "", "output": "Not at all. I'm glad to be of service."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. The next night--that would be Saturday--I again asked the crow what it had to tell me and followed it into the maze. And again I wandered around for hours. Then I remembered and called out to you. And you appeared between my feet--in my dreams, you're a mole.", "input": "", "output": "That's flattering."}, {"instruction": "Don't be insulted, you'll know soon why moles are on my mind. You guided my through the maze. Sometimes, you got ahead of me, and I lost site of you around a corner. Sometimes, I followed you down a dead end. And when I tried to ask you for help, you weren't in front of me any more but around some other corner, saying I had taken the wrong turn. And then--I love how dreams can change scenes dramatically without you noticing at all--you were holding the door for me to go into my old house in Marietta. Only we didn't live in Marietta, we lived in Decatur. But I heard of a plane crash in Marietta last Saturday, so that explained that. Hey. Now that I think of it, I believe you were wearing that tie.", "input": "", "output": "Was I still a mole?"}, {"instruction": "No, no. You were you by then.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, this is a wonderfully detailed dream."}, {"instruction": "Isn't it though? So I went into this house, and it was deserted. There were just a few forgotten things from the move. But they weren't the kind of things you'd ordinarily forget. The curtains were still up. There was a chair here and there. I saw my favorite stuffed animal. I remember having it, but now I can't think of what really happened to it. There was a pad with drawings on it that must have been Philip's. And there was Daddy's flight bag. That just tore my heart out. I fell to my knees, crying \"Daddy, Daddy\" over and over again, just sobbing. I've never felt such strong emotion in a dream before. It was more than I could take. The dream just fell apart at that point. I woke up crying.", "input": "", "output": "This was a very powerful dream. Here are some tissues. Can you go on?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I'm okay. The phone rang almost immediately after the dream ended. It was Philip. He felt something was wrong, so he called. I wrote it all down while he was on his way over, and then we talked about it over breakfast. God, I love my brother. He never thinks I'm crazy, he never thinks my feelings are inappropriate. He fully understands what I'm going through with Daddy. He doesn't find it at all strange that I'm enormously successful and yet still dissatisfied. I may never get married, Doctor Balis, because no man will ever live up to my brother.", "input": "", "output": "You do seem to have a good relationship with him."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. But that was the longest, most engaging conversation we've ever had about Daddy. I talked and cried for hours. And he was right there with me, understanding, even crying along with me sometimes. I have the most incredible, wonderful brother of all time. I'm sorry, the tears aren't all about Philip. The whole dream thing was...is pretty emotional for me.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. Take a moment to compose yourself if you need to."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. Sometimes, I'm a woman when I least expect it. Anyway, that dream triggered a catharsis. I talked all about how I felt when Daddy left, and what Mama did to me, and how I drove and drove myself to meet his expectations when I didn't even know what those expectations were. I know I've told you all that, but that was different. You're behind that desk with your note pad and your serious looks. To you, I'm relating symptoms; to Phil, I was living reality.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I'm sure you have a different rapport with your brother than you do with your therapist, although I believe you've had pretty good contact with your feelings in here. But it can be important to talk things out in different ways with different people. The more you work something through, the more it will reframe itself in your mind."}, {"instruction": "Uh huh. So the result of all this was that I felt much better after talking to Phil. And I knew that all my confusion and turmoil was okay with him. He understood. And I know that it's okay to have these feelings. Finally, he asked, \"So what are you going to do next?\"", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "And I decided: I will talk to Daddy.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "In a dream, of course. I was so excited about it, I couldn't wait to go to sleep that night.  I was so anxious that I was afraid I wouldn't be able to make it happen. The ritual helped, but still I woke up twice during the night. Once, I was just dreaming about ravens. Another time, I woke up with a vague, fuzzy memory of the maze. Finally, I told myself, \"This is ridiculous. Just relax, go to sleep, and if it happens, it happens.\" And the pressure was off, and I went right there.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "This time, I opened the door to the house myself, you weren't there at all. I got to Daddy's flight bag, and when I looked up, there he was, sitting in his rocking chair--the one he used to sit in to read to us. He picked me up onto his lap like I was six, but really I was eleven. And then, I was thirty three, just as I am now. I was all three ages at once, and it was not at all incongruous.", "input": "", "output": "That's the magic of dreams."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. We talked. That was last Sunday. And then we talked again Monday night. Last night, he told me I didn't need to see him any more--he said everything was all right now. And I think he's right.", "input": "", "output": "Then why are you crying?"}, {"instruction": "I'm going to miss him. I have to let him go now, he's right about that. I can't hold onto this memory, this pain, forever. I have my answers now, so I have to say goodbye. Daddy's gone, and I'm going to miss him.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I think this is a very positive step. These dream conversations sound like the closure you've been looking for."}, {"instruction": "I think so.", "input": "", "output": "Can you tell me what you talked about?"}, {"instruction": "Do we have time for that?", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to hear it, if you can talk about it right now."}, {"instruction": "I can't quote actual dialog. Basically, he said two things: he's sorry he left the way he did; and he's proud of what I've accomplished. He explained that he had to follow his destiny and that it tore him in half to have to give up his family for it. He also said that a divorce may have been inevitable anyway. He and Mama were having problems. I never knew that, and neither did Phil. Certainly Mama never said anything.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did she mention it when you spoke a few months ago?"}, {"instruction": "No, never.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Please, go on."}, {"instruction": "I always intellectually understood that he was following his dream, but I never could grasp how that could be more important than his family. Now I see. He didn't intend to lose his family. He thought we could get back together for high school, or at least keep in touch and visit and all. I felt like he was running away. He explained that he was running to--he was pursuing his destiny.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What about the rest of it? You said that he was proud of your accomplishments?"}, {"instruction": "I asked him specifically if he liked what I was doing. I wanted to know if he liked what I was doing with kids now, but that's not exactly what he answered. This one I can quote. He said, \"You do what's in your heart, Katie. Do what you're good at, and don't worry about what other people think.\" And he was talking about more than just my involvement with the kids. He meant: don't do anything for other's approval, and it's okay to be proud of what I've accomplished and what I've made of myself. It's okay to be good with money. And I should pursue my talents, whatever they are, instead of worrying if I'm on the right track to support society.", "input": "", "output": "I think that is a sound advice. You can make yourself miserable trying to shoulder the weight of a dysfunctional society."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I'm going to try to dream about him again tonight, but somehow I don't think it'll happen.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you've turned a corner with this, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "I think I have.", "input": "", "output": "I think we should talk about this more next week, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I hope I can make it; it's shaping up to be a busy week. I may get my name in the papers.", "input": "", "output": "I'll look for it. Are you okay now?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, thanks. I'm fine. I'll see you next week. I'll call, if I can't make it.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "Good. Great! I can't believe how good I feel this week. Did you see the news?", "input": "", "output": "You mean SII's new product? I read the Wall Street Journal story; it sounds exciting."}, {"instruction": "Yes indeed. And the stock continues to climb as we speak. Don't sell just yet. It has a way to go still.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. I'll keep that in mind."}, {"instruction": "You don't seem very excited. You bought, didn't you?", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, this is your therapy session. I don't think we should spend it discussing my finances."}, {"instruction": "Oh. Well, you had your chance. I did what I could.", "input": "", "output": "And I appreciate it. Now what else made your week so good?"}, {"instruction": "The product announcement was a great success. And the company is poised perfectly for it. I have strategies, plans, and contingencies in place to take full advantage of this new boost in value and the upcoming influx of cash. And I can't believe it all came off so well! The way the rumor mill runs inside this company, it's amazing none of this leaked before the announcement.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Of course, until just a few weeks ago, it was a secret inside the company. It makes me wonder what else Product Development is up to. But now, I'm going to take a break. And then I'll spend May and most of June gearing up and working on the new budget. We're going to pay down the debt, expand some programs, and give P.D. more money. We may even use our new valuation, if it sticks, to start absorbing a few small competitors. That should make Lloyd happy--he's always had takeover fever.", "input": "", "output": "That all sounds good."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. So, what else makes me happy? Phil got another big contract over in Albany--a floor tile mosaic, can you believe it? There's nothing that boy can't do.", "input": "", "output": "I thought Phil was a painter."}, {"instruction": "That's his favorite medium, but he likes to try other things, too. Once, he spent an entire week on an etching in copper. Then, he did this multi-pass thing on metal photographic plates--I don't even pretend to understand that. And last night, I took him out to supper. He brought an Etch-A-Sketch to the restaurant and drew a very flattering portrait of me between the salad and the fish course.", "input": "", "output": "He did a portrait on an Etch-A-Sketch?"}, {"instruction": "Amazing, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "It is."}, {"instruction": "Then he just shook it up and started on something else. He's always doing something like that. He just can't keep still; he has to be creating all the time. The landfills are full of original Lippards that he did just to pass the time.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What else happened this week?"}, {"instruction": "I'm starting to hear that Jake's not doing well.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I guess it hit him harder than he let on. He's been getting drunk and rowdy, taking chances, and really living with abandon.", "input": "", "output": "Jake has always been a risk-taker."}, {"instruction": "This is different. He's a thrill seeker, but he always takes the proper precautions.", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "Okay, not with the motorcycle. But he took all the swift water emergency classes when he got into kayaking. And he carefully inspects his lines before climbing. And he got an FAA certification he didn't really need for the ultralights.", "input": "", "output": "What's different now?"}, {"instruction": "Now he's ignoring the regs. I heard they threw him off the cliffs when he came to hang glide drunk. And I saw him the other day; he has a bruise on his face from Australian rappel.", "input": "", "output": "Australian rappel?"}, {"instruction": "That's when you run full speed and leap off forward free-falling until the rope catches you. Ordinarily, it's done off an overhang or a bridge. He tried it off a cliff and came crashing back into it.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, my."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, ouch. I'm worried about him, but what can I do? I can't go back to him. And I'm afraid if I try to talk to him, it might make things worse.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you're responsible for his behavior. The two of you agreed that splitting up was best for you both."}, {"instruction": "Sure. But like I said, I still like him and would hate to see him get hurt.", "input": "", "output": "I understand that. You can talk to him and make sure that he knows that you didn't reject him personally and that the breakup was not a comment on his value as a person. Let him know that you're concerned about him and still value his friendship."}, {"instruction": "Being careful, of course, not to lead him into any false hopes.", "input": "", "output": "Of course. You know, this may just be his way of grieving."}, {"instruction": "How so?", "input": "", "output": "You've said that Jake is not good at expressing his feelings. If he's feeling loss or frustration, this risk-taking behavior may be the only way he knows to vent those feelings."}, {"instruction": "So are you saying that he just needs to vent and then things will get back to normal?", "input": "", "output": "It's a possibility."}, {"instruction": "I suppose so.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, we haven't talked about your dream at all."}, {"instruction": "No, we haven't.", "input": "", "output": "Well?"}, {"instruction": "I couldn't do it again. I couldn't get him back. I tried for a few days, but finally I just gave Andrew back his turtle shell and went back to sleeping normally.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "Not too bad, really. I hate to let Daddy go, but I guess he said his piece. Any more and it would just be nostalgia.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Katherine, do you feel that you actually spoke to your father's ghost?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. Alex does, though. It seems my experience is very similar to something that happened to him recently. I have to say I'm surprised that he doesn't see ghosts around every corner lately.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, never mind. Just when I think he's starting to grow up, he goes and pulls some stupid teenage shit again. I can't help but love him, and I'm still his friend, but that doesn't mean I approve of everything he does.", "input": "", "output": "Of course not."}, {"instruction": "But that's off the subject. No, I don't think I was really talking to my father's ghost. Not directly, anyway. I suppose in some way, I could have been. I mean...it's hard to explain.", "input": "", "output": "Give it a try."}, {"instruction": "I suppose part of him is always in me. He made an impression on me, so I'll always carry both the memory of him and the imprint of his teachings.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I can't totally discount the psychic connection. Philip and I read each other's moods from across town. And I remember the time he got beat up in Charleston, I woke up in Charlotte in the middle of the night knowing he was hurt. So I suppose I could have picked up a little of Daddy in the same way.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Where exactly do you think your dreams came from?"}, {"instruction": "I've been thinking about that. I guess the only explanation is that I made them up myself. I've been thinking about Daddy so much and trying so hard to direct my dreaming, that my unconscious took what it had--the memories, the imprints, maybe even a little connection--and combined it with my own desires to come up with something I could accept and use.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like a reasonable explanation."}, {"instruction": "But this means that it was all me. It means that I have to accept that what he said was my own words. If you take this explanation of dreams, than dreams are just me telling myself that I should be proud of my accomplishments, and pursue my dreams, and do what I'm good at. And that I shouldn't be ashamed of who I am.", "input": "", "output": "Those are all good things to tell yourself."}, {"instruction": "I guess they are. It's just a little hard to reconcile--unconsciously I feel one way, but consciously I still wonder if I'm on the right track and whether I'm taking more from society than I'm giving back.", "input": "", "output": "It's perfectly normal to have conflicting feelings. Sometimes, different things pull us in different directions. In your case, you have your father telling you to pursue your dreams, and your school teaches you to do well in business, and our society advocates getting ahead at all costs."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Add in the things you've recently learned from Alex and Jake about relationships, and you've got quite a recipe for confusion."}, {"instruction": "I guess I have to sort it all out.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you do. And I'm here to help."}, {"instruction": "I know. Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "For what it's worth, I think you gave yourself some good advice: do what you're good at, particularly if you can be valuable to society, which you can be. And judging from what you've said today, you still get a great deal of personal satisfaction from your job."}, {"instruction": "I do.", "input": "", "output": "And if you feel like you should be contributing something more, you can do that, too. You can be a big help to the Arts Alliance without leaving your job. I think you're already on your way to reconciling your conflicted feelings."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I need a little positive reinforcement sometimes. Doctor Balis, do you believe that we're each put on earth for a specific purpose?", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about it, Katherine?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  I don't subscribe to the notion that we're all part of some large, divine plan, exactly. But if it was true, I think it would probably be for several purposes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I can see that."}, {"instruction": "Oh well, it's not like we'll ever know.", "input": "", "output": "I suppose not."}, {"instruction": "Okay. See you next week, then.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Good afternoon, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "I brought you something.", "input": "", "output": "This is interesting."}, {"instruction": "The pyramid represents focus and power. And look what's inside.", "input": "", "output": "Yin and Yang."}, {"instruction": "Balance and harmony. I think this is a pretty good representation of what you're about and also of what I'm about--what I'm trying to do here.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Katherine. I have just the place for this."}, {"instruction": "I like that there. Obvious, yet unobtrusive.", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Thank you again. So, what's on your mind this week?"}, {"instruction": "I think I've settled a few things. Now that all the hullabaloo has died down at the office, I've had time to think about the dreams.", "input": "", "output": "And what have you come up with?"}, {"instruction": "That I'm right. Assuming that everything in the dreams came from myself, I'm right. I like what I do. I work hard on my plans, and it's satisfying to see them come to fruition. I saw my pension plan described in the papers as the envy of the industry. I'm proud of that. Something I did is held up as the best in the business. So I'm not a social worker or a lobbyist for Amnesty International. The creation of wealth has value, too. I'm good at what I do, I'm proud of it, and I enjoy it. What people do with the wealth I help create is their business.", "input": "", "output": "Certainly. And what you choose to do with your own wealth is your business."}, {"instruction": "Right. So I'm comfortable with my job; I'm keeping it. Do what you're good at and don't worry about what other people think.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "I still want to do something more, though. I'm staying with the Arts Alliance and Social Venture Partners. And I'm thinking about Junior Achievement, if I can find the time. I'm really coming into my own. I'm fleshing out, doing things that I enjoy and that gives me a good feeling about myself. I wish I had started this years ago. It would have made the corporate climb much more fun. Then again, I think I'm able to do all of this now because I'm not climbing any more. I'm as high as I want to go. Now it's time to see what else is out there.", "input": "", "output": "I think that's true. And it could also be that reaching the top is what triggered this spiritual crisis in the first place."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, like, \"Where do I go from here?\"", "input": "", "output": "Exactly."}, {"instruction": "That's settled then--no major lifestyle changes. So what if people call me a \"limousine liberal?\" My heart is in the right place. And Daddy would say, \"Follow your heart.\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Something else on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "I talked to Mama.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "She said there was no problem with her marriage before Daddy left. She would have gone to the ends of the earth for that man. It's like the way I feel about Philip only, you know, romantically.", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "They weren't fighting. There were no issues. She didn't like being away from her family. But other than that, things were great. So said Mama.", "input": "", "output": "You don't believe that?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I do. And that's just it. It's the part of the dream I can't reconcile. I remember it clearly: he said they were headed for trouble anyway. The only thing I can figure is he was tired of being worshipped.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "It's too much of a good thing, you know? No dissension, no arguments. And no excitement. A person must get tired of being perfect all the time. I wonder if a king grows contemptuous of his adoring subjects, knowing that he's just a man like the rest of them, knowing they're too dense to realize that the only thing that makes him better than them is the coincidence of his name and the privilege of his education.", "input": "", "output": "Do you believe your father grew tired of his family because he felt their love for him was misplaced?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not misplaced, exactly. Tedious. Overwhelming, maybe.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What led you to this conclusion?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, it's not a conclusion. It's more of a hypothesis.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I'm going to suggest something you may not like."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'm ready.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think is the chance that your mind invented this impending trouble between your parents in order to exonerate your father?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Do you mean that I'm choosing to view his leaving as inevitable in order to avoid blaming him for what was clearly his option?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "That's a possibility, I guess. It would fit in with the way we've been viewing this dream.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it would."}, {"instruction": "Well, that makes sense. But the point is moot, anyway. It's too late for blame.", "input": "", "output": "Is it?"}, {"instruction": "Certainly. None of this is really about him, is it? It's about me. Laying blame will get me nowhere; I have to deal with what I have now, in the present.", "input": "", "output": "That's correct. It's good that you can recognize that."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. So, I'm thinking: I'm about through, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Through? With what?"}, {"instruction": "Therapy.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you say so?"}, {"instruction": "I'm pretty well settled now. My neurosis about having everything in order is gone. I don't even have many patterns any more. Ha! When I think about how boringly structured my life was when I came in here, I'm amazed I didn't do this a long time ago. I'm really out of my shell. I go out, I do things on impulse, I change frequently. I'm not afraid to try new things, meet new people. A year ago, I would never have been able to befriend Alex, or work with the Alliance, or even take a walk with Andrew. Oh, I didn't tell you about that, did I?", "input": "", "output": "No."}, {"instruction": "Andrew's been taking me places I didn't know existed around here. I live only a couple of miles away, and I spend most of my time here in the financial district. I hadn't explored the western part of the city at all. It's amazing--there are walking trails there where you can't even hear the traffic, much less see it. So, we've been getting to know each other. I think he's a little flaky, but at least he's intelligent and knowledgeable--which are different things. And maybe I can have a casual relationship with this man.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "So I invited him over one night, and it was clear what I had in mind. And he accepted, we made plans. Then just before we got ready to go to my house, he casually mentioned, \"You do know I'm married, don't you?\"", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "No! I wouldn't have asked him if I had. Good god, I'm enjoying being a free spirit and all, but I'm not an adulteress.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "He didn't think it was any big deal. Apparently, those professor types do this all the time. He said he was very much in love with his wife and wouldn't jeopardize his marriage for anything. But don't you think sleeping with another woman would tend to strain a marriage?", "input": "", "output": "It usually does."}, {"instruction": "He felt that if she didn't know, it wasn't a problem. But he understood my point of view, too. We discussed it rather than argued. So we're still friends. In fact, I'm going to meet his wife.", "input": "", "output": "Are you comfortable with that?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I haven't done anything. And I won't give him away. What he does in his marriage is his problem; I'm not involved. I enjoy his company, and if I like his wife too, so much the better. Maybe I can go to some faculty parties and have some really deep, stimulating debates.", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, this is certainly a more liberal outlook than I would have expected from you just a few months ago."}, {"instruction": "Yes, so back to business. It is, isn't it? I'm proud of that. I'm relaxing, I'm going with the flow. I feel good about myself, Doctor Balis. I'm a fine person, doing a fine job, exercising my soul and my intellect, and having fun at the same time. I work to better my community on several fronts, and I answer to nobody. Here it is in a nutshell: I'm relaxed and okay with myself, and I'm not concerned about other people's approval. As I see it, those were my two big issues, and now they're resolved.", "input": "", "output": "Are those your only issues?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I was uptight and didn't like myself. I was concerned with seeking approval for my actions to the point where I was ready to throw away my whole life. But I'm better now. What am I missing?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And what about your father?"}, {"instruction": "I don't need him any more. I gave myself his approval--that was the dream. And if the dream really was him, then he gave me his approval. Either way, it's not an issue any more.", "input": "", "output": "But this doesn't change the fact that he left you."}, {"instruction": "No, it doesn't. So what? I don't hate him, and I don't resent him for that. I don't blame him. I understand. And I forgive him.", "input": "", "output": "And so the whole issue just goes away? Is there any pain left from that?"}, {"instruction": "Sure there is. Of course there is. Don't you remember the conversation we had about grief? It's going to hurt for as long as it does, until I get over it. That's natural. I understand that, too.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. But I'd like to talk about this some more. Let's meet again. We can carefully evaluate your progress next time and see where that leaves us. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. Who knows, maybe we'll come up with something?", "input": "", "output": "Maybe we will. Next week, then?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. See you then.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Enriching. Yes, I think \"enriching\" is the right word.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Have you heard of 7th Plane?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure. What is it?"}, {"instruction": "It's a computer animation firm. About two years ago, I bought a big chunk of stock, waiting for it to get acquired by a bigger company. I even thought of mentioning it to Lloyd as a takeover target. They landed a big contract last week and the stock went up 260% in one day.", "input": "", "output": "That's quite impressive."}, {"instruction": "I thought so, too. So I dumped it. And since this is much more than I planned to make on this stock, I'm wondering what to do with the excess.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you'll think of something."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure I will. The Arts Alliance is doing well.", "input": "", "output": "That's good to hear."}, {"instruction": "It's a great place for kids to go after school. But I was thinking, what about kids who aren't into art? What about kids who are into sports, for instance? So I brought this idea to Josh: the Bay Area Youth Recreation Alliance--pool tables, basketball court, weight room, maybe a study area. And later, maybe we could organize outdoor activities like biking and such.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like a good idea. What did Josh think?"}, {"instruction": "He likes it, but he can't manage that and the Arts Alliance, too. So I'm going to try it myself. He and Leigha are showing me how to apply for grants and maybe some education money. Leigha's been very nice. She's a public relations and fund raising specialist; we've been working closely together. I'm the business manager, did I mention that? All it means is that I keep the books. But it's what I'm good at, and I'm helping to keep the Alliance on its feet.", "input": "", "output": "Good for you, Katherine. It certainly sounds like you have a lot on your plate."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm having to prioritize. I've decided against J.A., I'd rather do the Recreation Alliance. Social Venture and United Way are only two afternoons a month each. And with nothing on the burner at work, I'm down to half days most of the time. I have the time.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you're doing things that you enjoy, and that make you feel good. That's certainly better than laying out your clothes at eleven thirty every night and eating lunch on the same stool every day."}, {"instruction": "Wow, I haven't done that in awhile. How do you remember that?", "input": "", "output": "I looked over my notes. We were going to talk about your progress today, remember?"}, {"instruction": "So we were. Okay, let's do it.", "input": "", "output": "You've made great strides in your control issues. When we met, you were a rigid, unyielding businesswoman with no place in your life for frivolity or joy. You exerted inordinate control over every detail of your being and were markedly distressed when that control was thwarted. In fact, one such minor incident was what prompted you to seek therapy in the first place."}, {"instruction": "I remember. It seems kind of stupid now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure it does. How do you feel about having control of your life now?"}, {"instruction": "Um, more normal. I'm certainly more flexible. I don't schedule. I don't care if things don't happen the same way twice. It's now okay when little things have to get put off. I let Jeff take over the office--that was letting go of a lot.", "input": "", "output": "Does your need for control, or your perception of a lack of control, ever cause you distress?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. I'm only upset when things get really hairy or when something's going to cause a big problem. Mostly that's at work, though. In life, I just do things when they need doing and go with the flow. And I'm comfortable with that, if that's what you're asking.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Next topic: you expressed an emotional and spiritual emptiness that your financial and professional success couldn't fill. You're beginning to fill that with social interactions and with your volunteer work."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes! I get a great deal of satisfaction from that. I feel useful, and there's always something to do. I think part of my control stuff came from just not getting out much. I was bored and needed something to fill up the time, so I developed all these routines.", "input": "", "output": "That's interesting but I think it's only part of it."}, {"instruction": "You're right. Part of it was the corporate persona, and part was...well, I guess part was a reaction to a feeling of powerlessness over a chaotic world.", "input": "", "output": "I agree. But why do you think you began to feel powerless?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure. I hate to say it all goes back to Daddy, but I can't think of another reason. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "You once told me that you felt you should have been able to stop your father from leaving. I believe that your inability to control this important event in your life--despite your overwhelming desire to do so--may have been at the heart of your feelings of powerlessness."}, {"instruction": "Well, of course I couldn't control that. The decision was made, there was nothing an eleven year old girl could do to change that.", "input": "", "output": "But at the time, that girl thought she should have been able to. The beliefs you held at that time in that context are what shaped your thinking."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I can see that. But I've reshaped those beliefs and no longer feel the need to control the world. The world is beyond control, like it or not. And sometimes, I don't like it. Too bad. I just have to do what I can.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, on to social issues."}, {"instruction": "I didn't realize I had this whole grocery list of problems.", "input": "", "output": "Most people do. You're an intelligent woman with a complex psychological makeup. It's natural to discover and explore a variety of issues during the process of undergoing therapy. Frankly, I'm impressed by the speed and efficiency with which you went through them."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome. So let's go on with the social issues. I detected a fundamental loneliness at the beginning of our sessions together. How do you feel about that now?"}, {"instruction": "I'm too busy to be lonely now. I know dozens of people, and I'm meeting more every day. I don't have a large circle of real friends, but that's growing, too. I don't seem to have trouble meeting people or deciding whether I want to get to know them better, although most of the time I don't. People as a whole aren't particularly stimulating to me. I may never have a gaggle of friends like Jake does, but that's okay. I have Phil. I might meet some more people through Andrew. And it looks like Leigha will be a friend--my first female friend, how about that?", "input": "", "output": "Okay, all that sounds fine. But what about romance? You've only had one relationship since we've been working together. What are your feelings regarding that experience? How did that leave you feeling about men and the chance of finding a life partner?"}, {"instruction": "Oh well, disappointed. But I've really only dated two men seriously in my life. I guess it might take a few more tries before I find the right one, if there even is a right one.", "input": "", "output": "If?"}, {"instruction": "That would be a shame, of course, but I guess I could live with it.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to have children?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of. I'm not sure. I'd want to be certain that the father will be around for the long haul if I decide to have kids. But I may not need that. I think I can get a good deal of maternal satisfaction from my work with youth. I guess I'd like kids of my own, speaking in the abstract, but it's not a priority right now. Then again, I'll be too old soon. Well, you know, maybe I missed that opportunity. I guess I'll have to make the most of what I have.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How do you feel about men in general?"}, {"instruction": "In general, I'm cautious. I think most of them can't be trusted. But I haven't lost hope. I'll keep my eyes open, and if someone good comes along, great. If not, too bad. But I'm not going to settle for less than what I want. If all I can have is second best, I'll just do without and use my energy in different ways.", "input": "", "output": "That's a strong statement."}, {"instruction": "This is a big issue. Why should I invest my emotion and energy in a man who isn't worth it? I have better things to do with that energy.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Have you seen any crows since the dreams?"}, {"instruction": "Once in a while. They check up on me from time to time, I think. Andrew thinks they are my spirit guides, and I guess I could do worse. I just see two or three at a time, though. It's not like they still flock around me.", "input": "", "output": "I see. In retrospect, outside of your dreams, do you really believe they were flocking to you personally?"}, {"instruction": "I can't come up with another explanation. Other people noticed it, too. I know the whole mystical thing is out of character for me, but I'm just reporting what I saw. It feels weird to me, too; it felt weird at the time. Maybe that's what it took to get me on track for my revelation about my father. I don't mind. But I'm not going to go all New Age on you, if that's what you're getting at.", "input": "", "output": "It's not exactly, but it's good to hear that you have a realistic perspective on it."}, {"instruction": "And a little mysticism and spirituality is a useful thing in this world, don't you think? Okay. What else?", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel now about your father's abandonment?"}, {"instruction": "I was wondering when you'd get to that. I feel sad. I lost my Daddy. That's a hard thing to take at any age. It's too bad I wasn't allowed to properly experience my grief at the time, but I'm back in touch with it now and I'll get over it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "There's an interesting phrase: \"I wasn't allowed to experience my grief.\" No doubt Mama is coming next on your list, so let's get right to it. I resent her. I'm mad as hell about her cutting Daddy off the way she did. And as soon as I calm down some, I'm going to tell her about it.", "input": "", "output": "What do you hope to accomplish by taking to your mother?"}, {"instruction": "Discussion. Catharsis. Healing. I'm not going to keep it bottled up forever. It's a sore point in our relationship, and we need to iron it out so we can get over it. Or rather, so I can get over it, and we can go on being mother and daughter. I don't want to carry this anger to my mother's grave. But I'm waiting until I can talk about it rationally, rather than have an argument and make things worse.", "input": "", "output": "Very wise. But I still don't hear you assigning any responsibility to your father."}, {"instruction": "Oh, jeez. This again?", "input": "", "output": "I just don't think you have a realistic view of your father. You've said yourself that his leaving wasn't your mother's fault."}, {"instruction": "Yes, okay. He left, and that was his decision. But he hadn't planned to abandon us, it was Mama who cut him off. I understand why he had to go. And I sympathize with how torn he must have been between his dream and his family. As for a \"realistic view,\" I like the view I have, thank you very much. I like who my father is inside my mind, and I'm not interested in changing that.", "input": "", "output": "I see. We've only touched on your older brother a few times; anything there you'd like to discuss?"}, {"instruction": "Not that I can think of. I don't have a lot of respect for him, but that's not an issue. He's my brother, so he's okay. I don't have any issues about him that I know of.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Katherine, on the whole I'd have to say you've made remarkable progress. Your initial complaint seems to be gone, your self image seems strong, and your natural grief appears to be progressing normally. You're gaining experience in social and romantic settings, but continued progress in that realm can't be accomplished through therapy alone; you just have to practice."}, {"instruction": "But?", "input": "", "output": "But I'm not certain you've fully processed your feelings of abandonment by your father or your feelings of resentment toward your mother. And I suspect that there might be something more about your relationship with your older brother..."}, {"instruction": "So you don't think I'm finished?", "input": "", "output": "I think you're very close. I'd like to keep seeing you for a while. But if you feel like you would like to decrease the frequency of our sessions together, I think that would be okay. How do you feel about changing to every other week?"}, {"instruction": "I think I'd be okay with that. I'd like to set a goal, though.", "input": "", "output": "What is that?"}, {"instruction": "I want to be finished with therapy by the fourth of July.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Well, let's make it a goal, but not a mandate. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Deal. So I'll see you in two weeks at the same time?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "May thirteenth. See you then.", "input": "", "output": "Don't hesitate to call, if you'd like to talk before then."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Good night.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc! Miss me?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. How have you been?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. I found out that we pretty much don't have a financial department after three forty-five on Wednesdays.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently this started when I was the office manager. They realized I had a standing appointment and would never be there on Wednesday afternoons, so everyone just got in the habit of taking off early. The newest guy actually thought it was a long- standing policy! So between coming in at eight thirty in the morning, taking an hour off for lunch, and leaving early Wednesdays and Fridays, I figure the average work week in my department is about thirty five hours.", "input": "", "output": "Is that okay with you?"}, {"instruction": "What's the hell? The work gets done. Besides, managing the office is Jeff's job now. So I'll go with the flow--I'll go to the Alliance on Wednesdays.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds reasonable."}, {"instruction": "I was thinking on the way over here about all the things I have to catch you up on. I'm used to only telling you a week's worth of stuff; so much can happen in two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "I don't have to know everything that happens to you, just the things that affect your emotional well-being."}, {"instruction": "Well, all of this bears on my psychological state.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "I had that talk with Jake that you recommended. I took him out to dinner--just friends--and we talked. He admitted he was hurting over the breakup. I admitted I was, too. But we agreed that getting back together would be stupid. I assured him that I didn't reject him personally. He agreed that we weren't meant for each other long term. It started off rather awkwardly, but after a bottle of wine and an hour of conversation, we got comfortable with each other again. I think we can stay friends.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like a good thing."}, {"instruction": "I think so. I've never done that before; it'll be interesting to see if I can pull it off. We're going hiking this weekend with a small group.", "input": "", "output": "Going with a group is a good idea. And I think keeping Jake's friendship will be good for both of you."}, {"instruction": "So do I. You know, when I told him that I didn't reject him personally, I thought I was lying. Do you remember all the things I said about him being shallow and uneducated?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do."}, {"instruction": "He's not, really. Mostly, he's just uncommunicative. I think I was just using those things to help justify leaving him. I really do respect him, and I like him. I'm just not in love with him.", "input": "", "output": "People often come up with a list of negative attributes--real or perceived--to help them get out of relationships. But most never realize it. It shows a great degree of self-awareness to notice what you were doing."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I'd like to have seen it while I was doing it, but I guess I still need some practice.", "input": "", "output": "Anything gets better with practice. You have a good start. Just try to keep an eye on yourself and sometimes stop to ask yourself, \"Is this what I really believe, or am I making this up for some other purpose?\" Continue to practice being aware of your own motivations and emotional and mental states, and you'll do fine."}, {"instruction": "I will. I like knowing what's going inside my head. I'm surprised I did so well for so long without understanding anything about how my own mind works.", "input": "", "output": "Most people go a whole lifetime that way. You're way ahead of the general population."}, {"instruction": "Hmm, I like that. Of course you know that's going to go straight to my head and make me even more snooty and superior, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think so."}, {"instruction": "Well, that reminds me: Alex's parents are getting married.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "That's a very neutral response, Doctor Balis. It's almost as if you didn't know about this. Yes, Larraine is marrying the father of her oldest son, a mere eighteen years late. And I'm invited, can you believe it?", "input": "", "output": "Really? Are you going?"}, {"instruction": "I think I will. I want to show her there's no hard feelings. But I went to Nordstrom, and my god! They're registered for Lenox and Waterford and other equally pricey luxury items. I've been to Larraine's house, and this is way beyond her. It's as if she's trying to buy social status. This reminds me of my sister-in-law--she's more concerned with social standing than with any kind of practicality.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure Larraine and Mark already have all the normal household items they need."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure that's true, but unless they're entertaining the Kennedy\u00d5s--or my sister-in-law--they don't need two hundred dollar leaded crystal brandy snifters with individual sterling silver warmers. I might get them a crock-pot.", "input": "", "output": "Are you serious?"}, {"instruction": "Sure! At least they might actually use it. I don't care how rich you are; it's a waste of money and resources to display fine china in a case just so people can be impressed.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Speaking of wasting money, I may sell my condo.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I'm thinking about a house high up in Forest Hill or maybe over in Sea Cliff, although I do like my view of the Bay.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you want to move?"}, {"instruction": "I just want a house with a little lawn. I guess I'm kind of nostalgic for space. Plus, not being all about business any more, I don't want to live downtown. When I leave work, I want to leave the business district, to have that demarcation between my job and my life.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. A clear separation can keep things in better perspective."}, {"instruction": "Exactly. Plus, I have this ton of money to spend.", "input": "", "output": "From that stock trade you told me about?"}, {"instruction": "Oh that was nothing next to this. My first set of options with SII matured, and I cashed in on the new valuation. How does this sound: \"The Katherine L. Lippard Foundation is making grants to enhance the safety of America's youth.\"", "input": "", "output": "That sounds very nice."}, {"instruction": "I'll support studies of teen crime and after school programs, things like that. If Robert Wood Johnson and Charles Stuart Mott can have foundations, why not me? I'll use all the skills I used to build the retirement program to build a charitable foundation. Maybe it'll even live on after I die.", "input": "", "output": "That's very noble, Katherine. But you have quite a lot on your plate now, don't you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I do. But Leigha is being very helpful. We're becoming quite good friends. You'd be proud of me. I like her a lot.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that. It certainly sounds like you're enjoying your life."}, {"instruction": "I am. Finally, I am. Doctor Balis, I am profoundly grateful. I couldn't have done this without you. I know it's your job, but I don't think that just any therapist could have done what you did with me so quickly.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Katherine. But I'm just a facilitator.  You did the work."}, {"instruction": "Your modesty is thin, Doctor. Go ahead and beam. I see you wanting to.", "input": "", "output": "Is anything else on your mind today, Katherine?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, in fact there is. I've given some more thought to my father.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I know you think that I should be upset with him or, I guess you expect it. But I just love him too much to be mad. If Phil told me he had to move to Paris to be the kind of artist he wanted to be, I'd want him to stay of course, but I'd tell him to go. I guess I'm disappointed that Daddy never got back in touch with me, but I'm not mad at him. I'm hurt about what happened to me, but it's too late to do anything about that now. What I can do is try to help kids who are in that kind of situation now. That's part of what my foundation and the Recreation Alliance will be about. I'm angry about what happened to me as a child, I'll admit that. Maybe it's not directed the way psychiatry thinks it should be, but it is what it is. And I'm angry that other kids have to go through that through no fault of their own. But I can help make it better. Maybe I can't personally make a kid's life better, but I can provide the funds to pay someone else who knows how to do it. That's what I'm good at. If I can prevent one little girl from growing up like I did because of some screw-up by her parents, then it'll be worth every penny I spend.", "input": "", "output": "I think you can help considerably more than one little girl."}, {"instruction": "I hope so. Boy, I really got on a soapbox there, didn't I? That sounds like the start of a good fund-raising speech. Maybe I should write that down.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I think I will. That just gave me an idea for a series of dinners. I'll discuss that with Leigha tonight. She's cooking dinner for me.", "input": "", "output": "That's nice."}, {"instruction": "It should be. Well, thank you again, Doctor Balis. You've really made a difference. Uh, would it violate your ethics to give you a hug?", "input": "", "output": "I think that would be all right."}, {"instruction": "Good. Okay, see you in two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Katherine. You're looking happy today."}, {"instruction": "I am, I am. Life is good. It's Spring in the City; my job is easy; my friends are...uh, friendly; my brother is happy and prosperous. The foundation is getting started; my work at the Arts Alliance is moving along; and I think the Recreation Alliance may actually get off the ground. I might not be able to open it until this winter, but by next summer, I think some school kids will have a place to go that encourages learning and self-esteem rather than boredom and crime. I met a school board member, and he seemed receptive to the idea. So we might get the city school system's backing. That would really put the rockets under the project.", "input": "", "output": "That all sounds very exciting."}, {"instruction": "It is, I am excited. And I'm planning a vacation as soon as the budget is finalized. The budget looks wonderful, too, mostly thanks to the Mole.", "input": "", "output": "Where will you go on vacation?"}, {"instruction": "Um...Alaska.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure you do. I've always wanted to see Alaska, it's the last great wilderness. And the middle of summer is the perfect time. And it's nice and far away from here physically, emotionally, and culturally. It's very remote, very good for thinking and getting things in perspective.", "input": "", "output": "So you're not going to look for your father while you're there?"}, {"instruction": "Uh...well, not really. Sort of. I do have the name of a town from his letters, and I plan to visit there. I'm curious about what happened to him, what drew him so far from the life he knew. That's natural, right?", "input": "", "output": "I suppose so."}, {"instruction": "And, of course, I'll try to learn something about him while I'm there. If he's still there, fine, we'll meet. But I doubt he will be. There's a couple of J. Lippards in Alaska, but none near Malbae.", "input": "", "output": "You've found some men with your father's name?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. It's easy on the web. I was just playing around one night and came up with a few listings. I've never been really sure if I wanted to contact them and find out for sure. I was afraid of what I might learn, I guess. But I figure, since I'm going anyway, I may as well visit his town while I'm in the neighborhood.", "input": "", "output": "Will you be in the neighborhood? Alaska's a big place."}, {"instruction": "Anything is accessible if you have the money. I'll hire a charter or hitch a ride with a bush pilot. I'm going to be going all over anyway, seeing all the natural wonders on the regular tourist routes.", "input": "", "output": "What will you do if you find him?"}, {"instruction": "I'll say hello, tell him what I've been doing, get acquainted. I'm not afraid. He'll like me, I'm sure of that. But I don't feel like I need his approval. I just hope he's not a jerk or that he doesn't run from me and try to deny his past. That would hurt.", "input": "", "output": "Are you interested in renewing your relationship?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It's not that important. If he wants to, fine. But I think it's been too long to expect a real close father-daughter bond. At best, we can be friends. At worst, we can go our separate ways again, hopefully with no hard feelings. But I don't think I'll run into him at all.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Intuition, I guess. I'm sure he's moved on. He might easily be dead, even. If I run into a clear trail, I'll follow it. But I suspect I'll find he left years ago and no one knows exactly where, if I find anything at all.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Are you taking anyone with you?"}, {"instruction": "There are a few people I know who would love to experience Alaska. I thought about asking Jake; it's right up his alley. But I don't think I'd be up for all the exciting things he'd want to do, and I don't feel compelled to bankroll his recreation anymore.  However, I do want to go camping in the wilderness, and he's great at that. I don't want to do that without an experienced guide.", "input": "", "output": "That's wise."}, {"instruction": "I really want to go with someone I love and communicate with, and  with someone who can appreciate the majesty of it all. So I'm going to ask...", "input": "", "output": "Phil?"}, {"instruction": "Of course! We'll pack up his studio and take it in a duffel bag. He's perfect for Alaska.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure he'll have a great time."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure he will.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you'll be okay with whatever you find out about your father. Be sure to bring my number with you, okay? I'll be here if you want to talk."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, I will. But don't expect a call. I'm a big girl now; I think I can handle the world on my own. You've taught me well, doyen. I'll send you a postcard, though.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I didn't tell you about the wedding.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, yes, Larraine and Mark. How was that?"}, {"instruction": "I got them season tickets to the symphony--out of sight of my seats, of course. And it turned out to be the perfect thing. They're a much classier couple than I gave them credit for.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. I expected gaudy ritz: a champagne fountain, sequined dresses, enough chiffon to choke an elephant. What I saw was comfortable, understated class. The wedding at St. Mary's was sober and respectful, and the reception was actually in the Culinary Academy. I should have known they had the perfect hall there. Jake would have loved it, he enjoys architecture. I expected to see him there, but I guess he and Alex are still on the outs. The guest list was impressive, though: socialites and celebrities hobnobbing with mail clerks and Alex's friends. There were more than one elected official and some executives, and very few Rachelesque faux socialites. No one put on airs one way or the other that I could detect.", "input": "", "output": "So you were impressed?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I guess truly high class people don't snub their noses at anyone. It's a lesson I suppose I should take to heart.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "The whole thing was so impressive and comfortable that I stayed much longer than I originally planned. It was a good thing, too, because I got to see all the festivities.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing scandalous, sorry. Alex is a tough kid, but he can do the sweetest things sometimes. I guess he really does love his mother, despite all she's done to him. It gives me hope that I can get over my resentment of my mother some day. Anyway, Alex got all weepy when they danced together. A murmur went through the crowd--as they say--and I got there just in time to see her plant a big, wet kiss on his cheek. Alex turned beet red, and they were both crying and hanging on each other. It would have been a real spectacle if it hadn't been so pure and sincere. Alex had to excuse himself. I talked to him later about this, and he was all: \"Gee, gosh.\" He looked embarrassed and about ten years old.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds very sweet. Did you talk with Larraine at all?"}, {"instruction": "We chatted a little, it was nothing big. You have to congratulate the bride and groom at their wedding. She did seem genuinely glad to see me, but you never can tell with Larraine. I guess I still don't trust her much.", "input": "", "output": "I can understand that."}, {"instruction": "I met Alex's boyfriend, Luke. Oh, my God! I know the word \"hunk\" is pass\u00e9, but it's the only thing that applies. I was spellbound. He's the kind of man who, when he walks by, you just have to stop and look. Do you remember the Coke commercial where these women in an office building stop every day to ogle a construction worker across the street?", "input": "", "output": "I remember that one."}, {"instruction": "That's what I was doing. Alex immediately berated me, took on this big \"my man\" persona. And it was my turn to be embarrassed. Of course, I wasn't looking too shabby myself, judging from all the attention and proposals I got.", "input": "", "output": "So Alex was possessive? Did he really think there was a chance you would make a move on Luke?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no. It was all in fun. But Lloyd eclipsed us all.", "input": "", "output": "What did he do?"}, {"instruction": "He sent this huge, hideous, iron kinetic sculpture. It arrived on a flatbed truck about an hour into the reception. I guess he wanted to make a grand entrance, though I never saw him at all. Oh, the thing was awful! I have no idea what they're going to do with it. When I left, it was still sitting on the sidewalk, just creaking and moving in the wind and generally looking menacing. Sometimes, I think that man has no connection with reality.", "input": "", "output": "Everyone has their own taste."}, {"instruction": "No one has that taste.", "input": "", "output": "So you had a good time?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I did. And I gained a new respect for Larraine and a new insight into her and Alex. I'm glad I went.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Our time is running short; is there anything else you wanted to bring up?"}, {"instruction": "No, there's not. Nothing at all, really. Um, I mean...I think I'm through.", "input": "", "output": "Through? With therapy?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. We've discussed this before. I know there are some things you'd like to cover, but they don't seem pressing to me. I really can't imagine what I'd talk about if I came back. I feel pretty good about things. I don't have any internal conflicts. My life is wonderful. Congratulations, Doctor, another cure.", "input": "", "output": "Yes...well, thank you, Katherine. So are you calling an end to our sessions?"}, {"instruction": "I think that's best.", "input": "", "output": "Well, okay. I'm glad I could be of service. My door is always open to you, Katherine. Feel free to call any time you want to talk, I'll be available. In fact, I'd like to hear from you once in a while to find out how you're doing."}, {"instruction": "Okay, it's a deal. And you'll definitely get that postcard from Alaska.", "input": "", "output": "I'll look forward to it. Take care, Katherine.  It's been quite a year."}, {"instruction": "It has, hasn't it?  You take care of yourself, too, Doctor.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, I will.  Goodbye, Katherine.  I hope you find what you're looking for in Alaska."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doc! Yeah, sorry it's been so long. I stayed longer than I thought would. And I've been working my ass off since I got back. And I've been looking for a house and...well, it's all just excuses anyway. And then you canceled my session last week.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry about that Katherine.  I had a family emergency that I had to deal with."}, {"instruction": "I wouldn't know anything about those.  I hope everything's okay.", "input": "", "output": "It will be fine, thanks.  How does it feel to be back?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't even really caught up with Alex yet, though I feel like I really need to nail him down. He needs to talk. That boy sure leads an interesting life.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, that's a good word for it."}, {"instruction": "Have you changed the office around since I left?", "input": "", "output": "I'm always adjusting things a little. Why, what's different?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know exactly. It feels more crowded, somehow--more clutter, less space.", "input": "", "output": "Things do have a way of accumulating. So how was your trip?"}, {"instruction": "Great! I couldn't believe it. Alaska was so incredible, I just don't have the words for it. Jake might, he's pretty good with a phrase. Phil tried, he said he was so inspired he had to try some poetry, but he never let me see any of it. He said it didn't do it justice. It was the first time I saw him try something he didn't excel at. But paint...man, that boy can paint! We had to ship some stuff home, he painted so much. I remember one time--it was the first morning of a four day hike--we topped this ridge, and he just...it was like...well, he was ahead of me, so he saw it first. I heard him kind of groan and sigh at the same time, and he literally fell to his knees. I thought something was wrong, he could have been shot for all I knew. I ran up to him and grabbed him and asked what was wrong. But he didn't even look at me, which scared the shit out of me. Finally, he said: \"Katherine, look.\" So I did. My god, it was magnificent! The best word I can come up with is majestic, and that about half covers it. There were mountains, and glacier, and a hint of ocean off in the distance...oh, man. We sat there for an hour just looking, no exaggeration--I looked at my watch, it was over an hour. We just watched the cloud shadows caressing the hillsides, the eagles soaring on thermals like they owned the sky, the wind molding the tree tops. It took all that time just to absorb this amazing vista. And in all that time, we heard and saw nothing human--not a plane, not a dirt bike, nothing. At one point, I asked Phil if he wanted me to get his paints. He looked at me like I'd lost my mind. I remember his words exactly, he said, \"Holy shit, Kathy, I can't paint this.\" And he was right. There is absolutely no way anything can capture all that grandeur. We have no pictures, no canvas, just a clear, amazing memory of maybe the purest, most majestic place on earth.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like an incredible place."}, {"instruction": "It was. The whole trip was incredible. You have to go there sometime.", "input": "", "output": "I just might."}, {"instruction": "That was in the third week. We were having such a great time, that we decided to stay an extra week. I sent a telegram to the office to tell them. A telegram, can you believe it? Finally, we had had so much that we couldn't absorb any more. Actually, when we got back from that hike two days later, we decided to just spend a couple days relaxing in a luxury lodge near Anchorage and then go on home. Phil is still painting. I've never seen him so inspired.", "input": "", "output": "That's wonderful, Katherine. I'm glad you got the chance to experience all that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, me too. It was really life affirming. When I came back and got into the City and the office, it was...wow, what a difference. But it's all wonderful in its own way, you know? I was afraid I might feel oppressed in a city this dense after all that open space, but it's okay. I'm okay. I can enjoy all this city has to offer on its own terms. And if I want to, I know the rest of the world is out there. I might go to the South Pacific next and see how wonderful that is. I hear New Zealand is pretty majestic, too.", "input": "", "output": "I had a colleague who moved to New Zealand. He was pretty impressed by it."}, {"instruction": "I'll give him your regards when I go.", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid we lost touch some years ago."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I really do have the best of everything, Doctor Balis: a wonderful brother, a job I'm good at and like, the freedom to travel, the ability to enjoy a broad variety of experiences. It's good to be me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you feel that way, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Thanks again for helping me realize all this. I owe you a lot.", "input": "", "output": "You don't owe me, Katherine, I was glad to help. I like my job, too."}, {"instruction": "Good, that's good.", "input": "", "output": "Did anything else happen?"}, {"instruction": "Do you mean did I find him?", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of.", "input": "", "output": "What does that mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we went to Malbae, the last place I heard from him. A man at the airfield remembered him. He said he was just a kid when my father left. But that couldn't be right, the guy looked at least 45. Anyway, he couldn't quite remember which town my father went to. But after we bought supper and an amazing amount of beer for five men, we finally narrowed it down to two places. Phil went to Annorack, and I tried Imaim. Phil struck oil the first night, so I flew over the next morning on Gehenna Air. That took most of the day, and I feel lucky to be alive. I actually watched a bolt rattle out of a wing support as we landed. I've never been so glad to get off a plane.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was the kind of thing Jake would do, although I didn't know what I was getting into when I hired that guy. Anyway, Phil met me at the airfield with this woman, Mary-Louise Clark. It was right out of a romance novel. Mary-Louise has a boarding house, and Daddy rented a room from her for four years. They soon became lovers and stayed that way until he left. She said he was a sad man, kind of lost, kind of distant. He seldom talked about his family, but she said he had a picture of all of us that he always carried next to his heart. And she said he was especially fond of kids. He flew the mail and supplies to homesteaders in the bush, and he took tourists and reporters around. But he never flew hunters or geologists looking for oil or anyone like that. And when someone got lost, he was always the first to volunteer to look for them.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "She made him sound like a good man, with a strong conscience...yeah...and a hero, too. The way Mary-Louise told it, there was once a group of hikers that got caught too far out without the right gear. They had an injured man, no fuel for the stove, and a blizzard coming in. Daddy knew they wouldn't survive the storm and went after them, even though planes were supposed to be grounded. He got them out just as the storm hit. He made it back by dead reckoning--no IFR beacons out there. It was a damn fool thing to do, but he saved four lives. Mama would have freaked if he tried something like that while they were married. Hell, I would have freaked in that position.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like he took quite a risk."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Mary-Louise was pissed. But she's over it now. I can tell she loved him. She was full of praise for him. Apparently, he was caring, and compassionate, and stubborn, and quiet, and moral, and committed, and loyal, but finally, a drifter.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "One day, he told Mary-Louise that it was time to move on. She said she understood and just let him go. She got a few postcards from Rae, about 1200 miles East of Annorack in the Northwest Territory, Canada. Then, nothing. He could be in Greenland by now, or Norway, or Hispaniola for all I know. Wherever. But I know two things: he's a man I can respect, and he never forgot us, his family.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about all this?"}, {"instruction": "Good. I feel good, kind of complete. I know it's weird. How can I feel complete when there's so many questions left unanswered? Were is he now? Why did he leave? What was he looking for? But it's enough, you know? It's enough. He loved me, and I love him, and he's a good man. I feel sorry for him--he's always wandering, searching. And he probably doesn't even know what he's looking for. But he's trying to be useful, trying to do what's right. Hmm, he could be flying for Green Peace over the North Atlantic right now. Who knows?", "input": "", "output": "I'm curious, Katherine, how do you feel now about his leaving the family?"}, {"instruction": "I feel...well, I feel kind of sorry for him. I guess the marriage and family experience just wasn't for him. I was kind of inspired by Mary-Louise. Clearly she loved him, but she didn't fight it a bit when he said he had to go. She loved him enough not to hold him back. I can do that. I couldn't when I was a kid, I didn't know such a thing existed. Kids are all about themselves, you know? But I can now. I can let him go, let him pursue his own path. I guess that's something a parent has to learn when their kids leave home, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it is, although it usually doesn't mean never seeing your child again."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Have you talked to Phil about this?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. That night, after the vista I told you about, at the campfire, we talked. It was almost a week after we learned about all this. I guess it took that long to get to where I could talk about it.", "input": "", "output": "How does he feel about it?"}, {"instruction": "I think Phil always understood what Daddy was doing. Even when he was a kid, on some level, I think Phil got it. He says he never really felt abandoned. And for a long time, he couldn't understand why I did. He's glad to know Daddy's such a good man. He says he feels reaffirmed. Do you know what I think, Doctor Balis? I think Phil is really much more Daddy's child than I am. I think Phil is the man Daddy wanted to be.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Phil loves life, he approaches it with zest. He's found his dream, and he's following it. He's free in the world and within himself. I think Phil should be a daddy. He would make an excellent father.", "input": "", "output": "Have you given any more thought to having children yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Some. I think I can do it. It will be hard to find a man to meet my standards, though.", "input": "", "output": "Don't sell men short, Katherine. There are some good ones out there."}, {"instruction": "Probably. Oh my, look at the time. I've got to get back to the office--I'm still catching up.", "input": "", "output": "It was good to see you again, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you too. Hey, Doctor Balis, let's get together for coffee or something once in a while, okay? Friends, no therapy. You're a nice guy, I don't want to lose touch.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I'll think about that."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Take care.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Katherine."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. It's good to see you, too. How have you been?", "input": "", "output": "Fine, fine. More to the point, how have you been?"}, {"instruction": "On the whole, I've been pretty well. I moved into a new house.", "input": "", "output": "I heard, over in Seacliff--a very nice area."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I like it a lot. I'm thinking of having a housewarming in a few weeks. Do you think you can come?", "input": "", "output": "That might be a bit awkward. I assume you'll have people from SII, and I treat a lot of SII employees. Some of them might be uncomfortable if they ran into me there."}, {"instruction": "Hmm, you're right. Maybe you'd like to come over alone some time, to enjoy a sunset on the deck before it gets too cold? Do you like cognac?", "input": "", "output": "Katherine, I still don't think..."}, {"instruction": "We could have Phil over, too. I know he'd like to meet you.", "input": "", "output": "So what brings you here today, Katherine?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I understand, the decision's been made. On to business. I'm a little concerned about Alex. You know he's been staying with me?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I knew that. You understand that, even though you and Alex are friends, I'm very limited in what I can discuss about him with you without betraying any confidences."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I know. But this is mostly about me and what I can do in this situation.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. If we keep the discussion centered on you...does Alex know you're here?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I asked if this would make him uncomfortable. He seemed okay with it.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, where can I start? You know he's been staying with me. It's not a real problem, there's plenty of space, he has a room of his own. But...well, it's starting to cramp my style. I like my solitude. I like to be able to come and go as I please, play my music, have someone over if I want to. But there's very little solitude with Alex. When I'm there, he's kind of...well, clingy. Sometimes it feels like having a dependent child.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I understand that he's been through a trauma, and it must be uncomfortable for him to be alone. He's jumpy, and emotional, and sometimes almost regressive. He needs comfort, and support, and validation, and stability. I know I represent the epitome of stability to Alex. And I know he sometimes feels like I'm the only one who understands and cares for him. And I do care. I am sympathetic, and I want to support him. But I don't really understand...I've been through the Rape Crisis Center training for counselors, but I haven't been able to bring myself to actually fill the role. I just don't think I can do the job. I've never been the victim of any kind of abuse. I don't think I have a frame of reference from which to approach him.", "input": "", "output": "I see. I don't think you need to approach him as a rape victim counselor. It's not your role. Those issues Alex and I will deal with here. You're his friend, and it's that friendship that Alex wants and needs. Just be a good friend to him. Be non-judgmental, supportive, and caring. He needs an anchor, and you seem to be in the perfect position to provide him with that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, okay. I see that, and that's pretty much what I'm doing. But two things are happening. First, I don't feel like just being there for him is effective. I am providing a safe haven, both physically and emotionally, but I don't understand what's happening with him, what's going on in his head. Do you think you can help me with that? Why is he so skittish and unstable emotionally? And...well, why is he downright childish at times? Is this a normal reaction to a rape?", "input": "", "output": "Well, we're getting dangerously close to material I must keep confidential, but I can tell you some common human reactions to rape and other violent attacks. Some of what you've described are classic post traumatic stress symptoms. Victims often exhibit hyper-vigilance: jumping at small sounds, checking doors and windows they know to be locked, being unusually aware of their surroundings. The emotional overload of the attack may put a person on a hair trigger, less able to regulate emotional responses. Plus, the grief associated with the attack--until it is properly processed--may linger just below the surface, ready to come out at a moment's notice, often surprising even the victim with its suddenness and intensity. Many post traumatic stress patients are prone to sudden crying jags which they feel powerless to explain."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. What about the childlike behavior?", "input": "", "output": "Some victims unconsciously regress to what seemed to be a safer, simpler time in their lives, when the world wasn't such a scary place."}, {"instruction": "So he could become dependent on me as a mother figure, a protector?", "input": "", "output": "It's a possibility, but it doesn't sound like Alex."}, {"instruction": "No, he has a stubborn, independent streak that won't allow that. I don't think Alex was ever really a child.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I guess you shouldn't express an opinion on that. There is something else that I kind of feel guilty about.", "input": "", "output": "What is that?"}, {"instruction": "He's starting to cramp my style. I love him and all, and I want to be there for him. And I think I'm doing an okay job at that. I'm not uncomfortable with him. We have some good times together. And frankly, sometimes, it's nice to have someone else in the house. But at the same time, I want my solitude back. I feel selfish about it, but sometimes, I wish he would find another place to stay.", "input": "", "output": "That's not unduly selfish. You're used to living alone, and suddenly having an indefinite house guest, not to mention a teenager with heavy emotional needs, can be very trying."}, {"instruction": "You know, Alex is so worldly; it's easy to forget he's a teenager.", "input": "", "output": "Have you discussed this with him?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I don't want him to feel like a burden on top of all the baggage he already has.", "input": "", "output": "That's laudable, but you have to take care of yourself, too. You shouldn't neglect your own emotional needs; that could put undue strain on yourself and on your friendship with Alex."}, {"instruction": "If I grow to resent Alex that won't do either of us any good, will it?", "input": "", "output": "It could easily make a tense situation worse. Are you looking for my permission to tell Alex your feelings about having to take care of him?"}, {"instruction": "God, Charles. This is frustrating. I want to do all the right things, I want to help. Alex didn't deserve any of this, all he's really guilty of is some poor judgment. And trying to keep kids out of trouble is sort of a mission for me; that's what the Rec Alliance is all about, that's why I started the Foundation. But there, I just coordinate social workers and skilled volunteers. This is personal, and it's hard.", "input": "", "output": "It is hard. Social workers have a high burnout rate. That's why it's so hard to find a good, experienced intervention professional. By the time they get highly skilled, the cumulative stress begins to take its toll. You need to be careful not to let this happen to you. Set some limits, draw boundaries. Make keeping yourself healthy and comfortable a high priority."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, I am concerned about myself. That's why I'm here.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you came. You can strike a balance between your needs and those of your loved ones."}, {"instruction": "I worked very hard to get where I am today emotionally. I like the person I've become. I'm well rounded, stable, and content. I wouldn't want to lose any of that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So I need to back off from Alex in order to protect myself.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. If you really feel this way, you have to be careful how you go about that. If Alex senses that you're putting up barriers, he may take that as a rejection."}, {"instruction": "Well, then I guess we need to discuss some limits.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "How do I approach that?", "input": "", "output": "What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "How about, \"Alex, you're cramping my style. Get the hell out.\"", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you still have some sense of humor."}, {"instruction": "Too strong? Okay, maybe, \"Have you thought about how long you're going to stay here?\"", "input": "", "output": "That's better. That opens up a dialogue."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. But I'd like to have some ideas about where he could go. If that asshole Benny gets out of the hospital, then Ralph's place wouldn't be safe for Alex. Maybe Elgin or Josh could help with that.", "input": "", "output": "You have to be careful and not reveal to others any of the confidences that Alex has entrusted to you. Maybe your social worker contacts could help?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe so.", "input": "", "output": "So is there anything else you wanted to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "Let me see. Well, we covered Alex's symptoms, the pressure I'm feeling, and my guilt over wanting my space back--I haven't even spent a night alone in my new house. You helped get me back on track for taking care of myself--thank you. That was all the major stuff. My job is still the same. Lloyd is still an eccentric genius. My staff is happy and stable. The books are balancing. We've increased the dividend--you should have bought stock when you had the chance. More money's going into R&D. But this is all very mundane, it's not really relevant. Oh, I have a date this week.", "input": "", "output": "Good for you. Who is he?"}, {"instruction": "He's a benefactor for the Rec Alliance. I started to work on him for a donation to the Foundation, and we hit it off. He's old money, never had to work a day in his life. He just dabbles in the market a few hours a week to keep the wealth flowing in. But he managed to be a real nice, down to earth guy anyway. He was raised in New York, got a business degree from Harvard. He decided he didn't like that, so he moved here to get a master's in Philosophy from Berkeley. Now he's a philanthropist.", "input": "", "output": "Quite a varied background."}, {"instruction": "Well, we'll see if he's different in a purely social situation.", "input": "", "output": "So this is your first date?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I'm going to meet him for dinner.", "input": "", "output": "Good luck with that. And I'm glad you're still meeting people..."}, {"instruction": "Expanding my horizons!", "input": "", "output": "Indeed. Well, our hour is up. It was good to see you doing so well, Katherine. If you need more help with Alex, I'm always here. You can come in and talk things through any time. I'm here for you."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis. I may call again.", "input": "", "output": "Feel free. Goodbye, Katherine."}]
