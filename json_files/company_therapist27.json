Then I get to enter it all in the computer. And I can do all of that. I don't love it. I don't hate it. But I can \"move to the groove,\" as they say.

I moved to Sydney when I was seventeen.", "input": "", "output": "And you came here to pursue a career in stand-up comedy?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but there were other factors, too. Part of the reason was simply because I could. My mother was an American citizen, so I have a US passport--I can work here. She met my father when he came over here as part of an agricultural lobby group. They fell in love at some Washington, cow-fest, knees-up sort of thing. She flew back with him to my father's farm, and they got married. And then they had me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have any brothers or sisters?"}, {"instruction": "No. Shortly after I was born, my mother was killed by a tractor. It was in the days before roll-bars were compulsory. I never knew her. She was only twenty-two. Too, too young. Out of respect for her, I don't do tractor jokes. And let me tell you, it's the only taboo I do respect, comically speaking. You'd be surprised how many times I have to censor myself.

Big Jill is a woman, Doctor Balis. A big, big woman. That's how she got her name. We were together for four years. In every sense, mind and body, she was everything.

But the thing is I won't compromise. I have a vision, a path to follow, and I won't deviate even if I have to pay the ultimate price, even if it meant I had to go back to Big Jill, which I won't. Take the early explorers. Australia's history of European exploration is littered with desert corpses. Burke and Wills--statues of these brave and famous explorers can be found in every city--lugged a cast-iron bathtub a thousand miles into an uncharted desert and died of thirst five miles short of a pub. Before they set out, when they were packing, people said to Burke and Wills: \"Whatever you do, don't take that huge tub with you.\" But they took it.

At this stage, the crowds aren't responding to my routine. There's noise all right: the muttering and murmuring of dawning distress; the chain saw clarity of front-row invective; and always the unnecessary wailing from the back wall. But there's no laughter.

It's always the same pattern. I get some drongo job in an office or a factory. I get the routine down pat, so I'm free to concentrate on what really matters--comedy. And just when I think I'm on the verge of flourishing, it all falls apart. Some distraction always creeps in. Some thread comes loose. The whole thing blows up, and I have to leave. So I got to thinking, maybe that is the pattern? Maybe that's how it's meant to be? Problem is that the time I spend at each job is getting shorter and shorter. And the jobs get harder and harder to find. I turn thirty next April. I'm an Aries, remember? I'm not sure I can keep up this pace.", "input": "", "output": "What is it specifically that makes your job at SII unbearable?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, the specifics don't really matter. They vary from job to job. It's the pattern that counts. I've been thinking, maybe I should spend some time in India or South America.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Can you name one specific thing at work that causes you stress or irritation?"}, {"instruction": "Oh well, if you want to anthropomorphize it, I'll give you a name. It's Doug Auble.", "input": "", "output": "Who's he?"}, {"instruction": "A loser, actually.", "input": "", "output": "Does this man work in your department?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. He has a desk about four feet from mine. Four feet, six inches to be exact. I measured it once while he was in the bathroom, trying to repair his scalp, or ease his eczema, or whatever the hell he does in there. But I don't give a snap about Doug Auble. A part of me thinks that if only he wasn't at the desk next to me...or better yet, if only he didn't work at SII, or if he didn't exist--if he had never existed, then everything would be fine. But I know that's not true. I can see things as they really are. Maybe in another place, another time, Doug would be...well, not quite so repugnant. Who knows? Hell, that's his problem.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Our time is just about up, Darius. It's been good to meet you. Obviously, it's your decision whether you want to leave your job or not. But I suggest that you give it a couple more weeks. In the meantime, you can come and see me. We'll talk and see if we can help you get that clearer perspective you were looking for. What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "Well, there are a few more venues round here I want to try to sneak my routine into. Do you know a place called The Cha-Cha?", "input": "", "output": "No, I can't say I've ever heard of it."}, {"instruction": "Well, anyway...yeah. I don't know about my job. When I make my mind up, that's usually final. Although sometimes, I don't follow through on what I have decided. But yeah, I'd like to come back. It's been okay today. Yeah...", "input": "", "output": "Excellent. Shall we say same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "Ha! If only you were the manager of The Cha-Cha...yeah. Good one. See you soon.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Darius."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. I'm still here, so...", "input": "", "output": "It's good to see you again, Darius. Please, come in."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Thanks. I wrote my resignation letter--I was going to quit, remember?", "input": "", "output": "I do remember; you seemed quite set on the idea."}, {"instruction": "I'd made up my mind. I put a lot of work into this letter. It ended up being quite good, just under twenty-three pages. It's this sort of thing: \"It is my sad duty...due to circumstances of a personal nature...interdepartmental conflicts...possible interdepartmental atrocities...I will always have a place in my heart...two weeks henceforth...for ever and ever, Darius Booth.\"", "input": "", "output": "I see. Did you hand it in?"}, {"instruction": "No! Ha! And I don't think I will for the moment. I finished printing it out on Thursday afternoon. I left it that long because of our first meeting. I wanted to think it over. I thought perhaps Doug might pull his head in. Fat chance. He seems to get worse every day.", "input": "", "output": "So why didn't you hand in your letter of resignation?"}, {"instruction": "Once, about a month ago, I left a dermatologist's pamphlet on Doug's desk. I was just trying to help--his entire epidermis is undergoing some sort of apocalyptic upheaval. And do you know what he did? He left the pamphlet right on top of his in-tray, where anybody walking past could see it. He can be malicious, all right.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I couldn't eat for days. Finally, during one of his lotion-laden trips to the bathroom, I had to sneak over and remove the pamphlet. Of course, he never said a thing. The whole thing was too...it was too awful. Does he come here? Sorry, I know I shouldn't ask that.", "input": "", "output": "My patient list is confidential, as I'm sure you know."}, {"instruction": "Yes, of course. Totally. I was just thinking out loud. If he doesn't come here, then he must go somewhere else. He probably has a whole team of doctors working round the clock--a United Nations of eminent surgeons scratching their heads and pulling on layers of latex. Oh, the disrepair!", "input": "", "output": "So why did you change your mind about handing in your letter of resignation?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. By the time I'd got the whole thing collated and bound, my boss went home. So I had to pack it away for the next morning.", "input": "", "output": "Did something happen that night to change your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Have you heard of The Cha-Cha?", "input": "", "output": "I think you mentioned it last week."}, {"instruction": "It used to be called something else, I can't remember what. They changed the name to The Cha-Cha a few years back to try and go up-market. Sadly, it kept on a fairly rapid decline anyway. It's been in the same location for a long time, but the surrounding area went from a pretty happening club scene to Multimedia Gulch. So now, it's a bit cut-off, a bit isolated.", "input": "", "output": "And what is this place exactly?"}, {"instruction": "Technically, it's a pub with comedy nights on Thursdays and Fridays. But I'll be honest with you, Doctor Balis, The Cha-Cha is a dive. It's worse than a dive. Perhaps it once was a dive, but at some point it bottomed out and began to turn nasty. It has odor rather than ambience, fog rather than light. The people who gather there may have already died, with their death gurgles and fate-sealing burps. It's a cramped, dark, humid yeast-hole.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds dreadful."}, {"instruction": "Oh it is. But it's funny, in a degraded way. It reminds me of Big Jill's first pub, the Boxing Dice.", "input": "", "output": "That was in Australia?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes. Big Jill is very patriotic. She would never leave Australia. Big Jill has often said: \"I like it wide and brown.\" And that was that. Ha! We had this running joke: whenever we would arrive at a party or nightclub, I'd go, \"So, Bigs, how do you take your men?\" And she'd reply, \"With drought and flooding rains, like my country.\" Ha! She was amazing. I thought it was all just joking around until I accompanied her on one of her northern sojourns. You should have seen her in the tropics, Doctor Balis: from Cape York to the Kimberly...dear God; in the very height of monsoon season; into the very heart of the tempest! No! No! She could never leave Australia! Never!", "input": "", "output": "All right, Darius. Just relax. Sit back and take a few deep breaths."}, {"instruction": "Yes, yes. Sorry. I'll just...goodness, this is turning into a two-hanky session.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like a glass of water?"}, {"instruction": "I'd never seen so much water, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Up north. And it was so loud. Half the time, I couldn't hear a word she said. I'm sure that was where my perspiration problem began--on the northern sojourn. Do you think I should see a doctor about it? It's probably some sort of gland thing.", "input": "", "output": "If it's troubling you, it's a good idea to talk to a physician. But it's not unusual for high stress levels to lead to excessive perspiration. Maybe part of the solution is to reduce your stress..."}, {"instruction": "By not talking about Big Jill?", "input": "", "output": "No, not at all. This is the place to work through your issues and to find areas of your life that cause you anxiety."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Get a perspective. Good one. But I'd rather not talk about Big Jill, if that's all right. I still have the rest of the day to get through.", "input": "", "output": "Okay then, why don't we return to your resignation letter."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes--the good news. That was Thursday night at The Cha-Cha. I'd scored a five minute try-out after the main act--Bertie Buckmeister's Pecker-boy routine. It was some R-rated ventriloquism revival thing. What an appalling act to have to follow. I nearly went home. All that manic head swiveling and lock-jaw grinning...awful. There was lots of stuff about how Pecker-boy had a constant woody, how he slept with a nubile sapling and got a Dutch-elm disease of the pecker, how he hated having Bertie's hand up his wooden ass. Appalling. Anyway, the geezers were spluttering lung-fulls of mirth all over that place.", "input": "", "output": "Isn't it a good thing to have the crowd laughing before you go on?"}, {"instruction": "Ha! Well, theoretically, yes. But during my five years in the business, I've found that the audience can easily be lured into what I call \"the laughter shallows.\"", "input": "", "output": "The laughter shallows?"}, {"instruction": "In the laughter shallows, the people are primed for the quick and the dirty. All they want is a sudden knicker-ripper and a surprise dildo attack. If I had a laugh for every time I've heard the house brought down by: \"So anyway, after I fucked her,\" I'd be on my way. Well, that's for sure.", "input": "", "output": "That bawdy style of humor certainly has a popular following, but there are many varied tastes when it comes to comedy, Darius. Perhaps you're performing in the wrong environment..."}, {"instruction": "What I do is stand-up comedy. Ergo, it is not only the right environment, it is the only environment.", "input": "", "output": "And you have no doubts about that?"}, {"instruction": "None. But listen, you're not letting me finish. Thursday night, the Punters were in. Bertie and Pecker-boy took their final curtain-call and left. I waited for the audience to compose itself and started for the stage. Suddenly, Pecker-boy reappeared from behind the rear curtain and gave a couple of lewd and woody waggles. I had words with the manager and waited for the audience to compose itself again. Finally, I was able to take the stage. I always use the first minute to reorientate my audience. I move through a series of intricate hand and facial gestures matched with contrasting high and low-pitched screams--a parody of evolution, with a few digs at the creationists. It has a funkiness and a raw sense of the elemental. It's supposed to create an alternative landscape, a place where comedy might suddenly emerge from a mysterious worm-hole, rather than spring wittily wrapped from the latest box of breakfast cereal.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Does it sound funny?", "input": "", "output": "It's hard to tell if a comedy routine is funny just from a verbal description. It sounds interesting."}, {"instruction": "You should come down there and see for yourself.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, at the first minute pause, all I could hear was the smoke seeping into the carpet and heavy drinking.", "input": "", "output": "That must have been very disappointing..."}, {"instruction": "\"Dying\" is what we call it in the trade. But you can stuff that. I mean, please. After I've worked in the Big Jill's inner circle, how could I possibly be afraid of \"dying?\" Ha! They wish.", "input": "", "output": "Did things improve after that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, during the second and third minute of the act, the usual howls of protest and sudden exits started to gather momentum and challenge the rhythm of my work.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But just into the fourth minute, when I made a series of stark comparisons between meteorology and sex, well...", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I think...no, I'm almost certain I heard laughter.", "input": "", "output": "That's good news. Did it build?"}, {"instruction": "It was just three syllables worth: \"Ha, ha, ha.\" But it was...it was unmistakable. I mean I know laughter. No one knows laughter like the man in a quiet room. I've heard all the trick-giggles, fools-guffaws, and belly-laughs that turn out be treatable conditions. I've had what was technically a laugh before, but it was worse than no laughter at all. It was laughter that delineates scorn, hate, contempt, goodbye. And, worst of all, is the laughter that came from what someone in the crowd has said.", "input": "", "output": "But you think this may have been different?"}, {"instruction": "I'm almost one hundred percent certain it was. It was a simple, unaffected laugh, perfectly placed at the end of my punch line. It came to me as plain and wholesome as a kiss on the cheek. It was mine.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's encouraging. But perhaps you should be cautious about placing too much emphasis on this one..."}, {"instruction": "Yes. You're right. I did overreact. And I made a mistake I've always been scathing of in others--I tried to milk that laugh. I tried to ad lib about the ebullient thundercloud piercing the unsuspecting troposphere. It was a big mistake. The room was pretty much cleared by the time I took my final bow. I immediately wandered straight to where the laugh seemed to have come from. It came from the back, near the jukebox and the outer reaches of the men's toilet. But it was so dark. Even up close and peering, the geezer just didn't come into focus. Maybe he'd already left by then.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you feel that this sign of encouragement can make your job at SII more bearable?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. That's the idea, isn't it? Maybe if I transfer to another department, away from Doug, and then get a bit of something going at The Cha-Cha...who knows?", "input": "", "output": "Will you be performing at The Cha-Cha again?"}, {"instruction": "Yes! I spoke to the manager after my gig. He's a strange little man with orange hair. We had an argument about how many people had left the premises during my act. He kept repeating over and over, \"It just wasn't funny.\" But I was able to hit back with, \"So what was that I heard after my Thunder-is-Heaven's-little-anti-rape-evangelist punch line?\" He said there was no laugh. I asked to see the owner. That was when he finally agreed to one more spot--the same time next week. Same time next week! Get it? Last week, right here, you said that! You could be my lucky charm, Doctor Balis. This is the first time I've snared a second booking at the same venue.", "input": "", "output": "Darius, surely you don't think there is any connection between..."}, {"instruction": "No, I don't mean it literally. But if Big Jill taught me anything, it was to never snub at the infinitely subtle and mysterious messages abuzz in the universe.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm afraid we're out of time for today."}, {"instruction": "No worries. But would you?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "We in the business tend to be very superstitious.

How have you been?"}, {"instruction": "Why don't you ask Doug Auble? He should know, the dirty sneak. Is there any way he could listen in from outside this door?", "input": "", "output": "No, that's not possible. What makes you think that he would try to do that?"}, {"instruction": "I tell you, it's the ugly ones you have to watch. He sits at his desk, quietly burping and blistering away, seemingly content in his own little compost. But I turn my back for one second, and he's rifling through my drawers and reading my personal papers.", "input": "", "output": "Hold on, Darius. What exactly did Doug do?"}, {"instruction": "He read my resignation letter, that's all! All twenty-seven pages!", "input": "", "output": "That's the resignation letter you wrote but decided not to hand in?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. It was buried under a stack of folders in the bottom drawer of my desk. I've always known Doug was a sticky-beak, but this? This is theft! This is a gross invasion of privacy!

Wow! Do you think I should? Because I can; I have evidence.", "input": "", "output": "You're not sure?  Did you see Doug reading your letter?"}, {"instruction": "No. But last Friday morning, I pulled it out of the drawer--things didn't go well at The Cha-Cha--and found a big brown thumb print on page thirteen. There's no way it was there before.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you so sure it was Doug's thumb print?"}, {"instruction": "It was like a squashed bug. And tasted of chocolate. Doug's always eating chocolate bars. He keeps a stash in his top left drawer. It's like a Grimm's fairy tale in there. With his skin condition, you'd think he'd watch his diet.", "input": "", "output": "Let's leave Doug's diet aside for the moment..."}, {"instruction": "I used to keep a bowl of fruit on my desk. Every time Doug would pull out a Mars bar, I'd start eating an apple. And I'd eat it loudly, partly to make him aware of the fruit and partly to drown out all the little noises he makes. But it didn't work. The fruit was like a red rag to a bull. Next thing I knew, he'd moved on to the king size varieties and to the two-for-one deals--an appalling business. I had to throw the fruit out.", "input": "", "output": "Getting back to your concerns about someone going through your desk, have you spoken to Doug about it?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't need to. I heard him talking to one of the other workers. He was saying something about how Jenny or Janie from Accounts Receivable \"wasn't funny.\" Then he raised his voice, making sure I could hear, and said, \"Yes, she'd better not give up her day job.\" I could have ripped his goiter out there and then.", "input": "", "output": "It doesn't sound like his comments had anything to do with you."}, {"instruction": "If he read my letter then he knew that my comedy routine has an underlying, rhythmic, gender fluidity--a slightly frenetic rhythm given my five-minute time limit, but it's there: girl, boy, woman, man.

And I promise you, it won't be pretty.", "input": "", "output": "Darius, you've mentioned previously that something has always gone wrong in the jobs you've had. Would you say the problem is always similar?"}, {"instruction": "Not at all. I've never come across anyone like Doug before. I should bring you in a photo so you can see for yourself. The lifeless hair pasted across his seething scalp; the extra mass of nose with its feeder network of veins and arteries; the eczema; the heavy spinnaker of flesh, billowing slackly beneath his non-existent chin; the short, pulpy body with breast development...", "input": "", "output": "That's a rather unflattering portrait."}, {"instruction": "And that's just the surface detail. More important is the way in which the whole package is animated. I suspect that Doug's outer ugliness is only a dim reflection of something far worse within.", "input": "", "output": "Like what exactly?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's not for me to say. But it's times like this I really miss Big Jill. She was a brilliant judge of character. She could pluck out their heart, if need be. But enough about Doug. He's not worth the time.", "input": "", "output": "Darius, I think there are issues surrounding your relationship with Doug that need to be examined. But if you'd rather not go on with it now..."}, {"instruction": "I'd rather not.", "input": "", "output": "All right, we'll move on. I'd be interested to hear about your previous job."}, {"instruction": "That was back in Australia, with a firm called Klomp Manufacturing. I was making those little keys that are used to open cans of spam and sardines.", "input": "", "output": "How long were you there?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, about six weeks. I can still remember the look on Mr. Klomp's face when I handed in my letter of resignation. He was mortified. He said, \"I'm not going to read all of this.\"", "input": "", "output": "Why did you leave?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, the whole thing went to hell.", "input": "", "output": "Could you be a little more specific?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose Janice was the final straw. She was a nasty, bony little thing who worked on one of the gasket-presses. She was always coming into the area I worked to have a go at me.", "input": "", "output": "What would she do?"}, {"instruction": "She mainly did knock-knock jokes. She'd stick her head round the corner and call out, \"Knock-knock.\" I always urged the rest of the guys to ignore her, but someone always called out: \"Who's there?\" I tried to stop her. I tried dropping a crate of keys or screaming out that I'd been blinded by an acid spill, but it never worked. Janice was relentless. Eventually, the whole \"Dick? Dick who? Dickhead!\" scenario would be played out. It was unbearable.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you find her jokes so offensive?"}, {"instruction": "There were too many of them. It wasn't right. I began to suspect something was wrong when she started plastering the sides of her gasket-press with comic-strips cut from the daily paper. So one night, I followed her home. It turned out she lived just two blocks from the Doon McDougal--a venue I'd performed in a couple of years ago. It was too creepy. I went straight home and began to write: \"Dear Mr. Klomp, it is my sad duty to inform you...\"", "input": "", "output": "You were concerned this woman might have seen your performance?"}, {"instruction": "If I remember correctly, things didn't go too well at the Doon. A lot of nasty things were said that night. Now I don't know if Janice was actually there or if she heard about it later, but all her comic-strips and knock-knocks were obviously designed to make a point. A lot of them made references to my routine. Once, at lunch, she looked at me straight in the eyes and said that she loved a good laugh. She was a knife, that one.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So you see, the two jobs presented very different problems.", "input": "", "output": "I do see some similarities, Darius."}, {"instruction": "Like what?", "input": "", "output": "In both workplaces, you've become very preoccupied with a colleague."}, {"instruction": "I think you've got it the wrong way around, Doctor Balis. I don't care if Doug lives or dies.", "input": "", "output": "Yet you're willing to quit because of his presence."}, {"instruction": "No...", "input": "", "output": "I gathered from what you've been saying..."}, {"instruction": "Well, you haven't been listening. Doug is nothing. That's the whole point of what I've been saying. I'd rather never talk about him again. Who cares if he read my letter? I got him back, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "Don't look so worried. I know what I'm doing. I know how to play these office games.", "input": "", "output": "Darius..."}, {"instruction": "It was only a harmless joke. Before Doug went to the bathroom this morning for his usual skin-and-hair salvation session, I placed a small, brown toupee in the washbasin.", "input": "", "output": "What was that supposed to achieve?"}, {"instruction": "I was just letting him know that I was on to him, him and his sneaky treachery.", "input": "", "output": "Darius, this is definitely not the way to deal with your problems with Doug."}, {"instruction": "It's like Big Jill always says: \"Ugliness begets ugliness.\" But it's over and done with. From now on, I'll just do my job and forget he even exists. I have a far bigger fish to fry.", "input": "", "output": "I want you to promise me that if you have any more problems with Doug, you'll talk to your supervisor, or call me, and not just take things into your own hands."}, {"instruction": "Doug who?", "input": "", "output": "Darius."}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay. It's a deal.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Now, was there anything else you wanted to discuss today?"}, {"instruction": "I had my second gig at The Cha-Cha last Thursday.", "input": "", "output": "How did it go?"}, {"instruction": "Not well. No laughs this time. And an ambulance arrived just as I was finishing. Apparently someone hyperventilated, or had a coronary, or something. The manager, Neville Hurt, tried to pin the blame on me--an outrageous accusation. All the drinkers in there have at least one foot in the intensive care ward. I told him he ought to run his pub like a race-track--have an ambulance follow the nags around, waiting for a fall.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like it was an unpleasant night."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. I suppose I had unreasonably high expectations after last week.", "input": "", "output": "That was when you thought you've heard laughter during your routine?"}, {"instruction": "It was there, all right. I can still hear it as though it were yesterday: \"Ha, ha, ha.\" I'd recognize it anywhere. Which is why I arrived so early at The Cha-Cha last Thursday--to see if I could find it. The unspeakable Bertie Buckmeister was on again, so there was plenty of cheap laughter around. While he put his despicable, woody-wielding Pecker-boy through the hoops, I wandered through the crowd, listening.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you heard it?"}, {"instruction": "No, it wasn't there. I was almost fooled on one occasion. Pecker-boy was trying to start a fire by rasping a chair leg--the crowd was going nuts. And from a corner table, I thought I heard the laugh, but it turned out to be a one-eyed man teaching a hag to blow smoke-rings.", "input": "", "output": "So will you be going back to The Cha-Cha?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Neville banned me from performing there again. So I insisted on talking to the owner. I always do that. I think it's my right, and you have to give yourself every chance. But he refused. I kept insisting, politely. The funny thing is that I quite like Neville. But anyway, he became increasingly nervous and evasive, didn't even give me a telephone number. But I just have a gut-feeling that I'm not yet finished with The Cha-Cha...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Well, Darius, we're just about out of time for today. Before we finish, I'd like to stress again that if any problems with Doug Auble arise again, you should call me."}, {"instruction": "Okay. But I've finished with him. This was good today. I've got it all out of my system.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I'll see you this same time next week."}, {"instruction": "Ha! I love that. Yes, indeed, I'll see you then.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Darius."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis! Great to see you! How are you?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Darius. I'm fine, thank you. Is something wrong?"}, {"instruction": "On the contrary. Like Madonna said at the Oscars, \"I'm king of the bloody world!\"", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Darius, just try and calm down a little. Please, take a seat."}, {"instruction": "Yes, all right. It's just a bit of a spin-out coming in here after the week I've had. Sorry if I'm a bit grubby, I haven't had a chance to get to the laundromat.", "input": "", "output": "You look quite pale. Have you been getting enough sleep?"}, {"instruction": "Don't worry about my looks. I'm a comedian, remember? It doesn't hurt to look a bit funny. But seriously, Doctor Balis, you see before you a deeply happy man. The world may be a beautiful place after all. I hope being ecstatic isn't breaking any therapist rules.", "input": "", "output": "Not at all. I'd like to hear what's put you in such high spirits."}, {"instruction": "It all comes down to The Cha-Cha. The Cha-Cha rocks! I've had this song going round in my head all week. Do you know Barry Manilow's \"Copacobana?\"", "input": "", "output": "I'm familiar with it."}, {"instruction": "That song. All week. With different words, of course. It goes: \"At The Cha-Cha, Cha-Cha-crapola; lung-meat and tumors are always the humors, at the Chaaaaa-Cha; Cha-Cha-crapola.\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, an interesting version."}, {"instruction": "It's not meant to be a go at Barry Manilow. Barry's okay. He put in the hard yards. Good luck to him.", "input": "", "output": "So what happened at The Cha-Cha, Darius?"}, {"instruction": "Everything! I knew that place had something. After our session last week, I realized that Doug Auble was taking up far too much of my time, not to mention money. Do you know how much a good toupee costs?", "input": "", "output": "It's not something I've looked into."}, {"instruction": "Hundreds! I should have gone with something basic, like a strangled chicken or a cut-and-paste note. I'm sure Doug never appreciated the levels of the toupee, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Have there been any more incidents..."}, {"instruction": "No, no, no. It's not possible--I took the rest of last week off. By Friday, I could barely remember what Doug looked like. He even changed appearance in my dreams.", "input": "", "output": "Does Doug Auble often appear in your dreams?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. But usually it's in a very straightforward way, almost like a replay of the day's events: Doug at the photocopier, doing something secretive and possibly illegal; Doug walking to his desk with a fist-full of chockie bikkies and wisps of steam rising from his shoulders. I figure, either I've got a very lazy subconscious or Doug is already so hideous that there's not much more dirt to be found on him.", "input": "", "output": "Dreams, in general, reflect one's own thoughts and emotions."}, {"instruction": "Yes, well, he's almost out of the picture now. In last night's dream, he was dressed as a priest. Except for a single nose-wart, his skin was blemish free and creamy-smooth. He stood so tall and impassive. I can't work out why I thought it was Doug.", "input": "", "output": "Did anything else happen in that dream?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. It quickly turned into someone else's movie, as dreams do. It went right over the top. Doug was holding my old green school-bag. He reached in and pulled out a pair of thin, slippery, black snakes. There was lots of running around and hiding, and I think my elbow cracked open. But please, the last thing I need is some MTV clip to tell me about my life.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But what is this? Why are we talking about Doug? It won't be long before I never have to see him again.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I've been offered a job at The Cha-Cha.", "input": "", "output": "You have? Doing what?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.", "input": "", "output": "You've been offered a job but haven't been told what it is?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think it will be as a full-time comedian. It doesn't work that way in the stand-up business, although Bertie Buckmeister sure seems to have tenure. He was there again on Thursday night. You'll be glad to know that Pecker-boy is still having it away with everything wooden.", "input": "", "output": "So how did the job offer come about?"}, {"instruction": "Persistence--that's the key, Doctor Balis. Since our last session, I've been at The Cha-Cha every minute it's been open.", "input": "", "output": "Darius, it's no wonder you've..."}, {"instruction": "It's not as bad as it sounds. The Cha-Cha often doesn't open until two or three in the afternoon.", "input": "", "output": "So have you given up your job at SII?"}, {"instruction": "No. I'll go back tomorrow. I want to see how everything pans out at The Cha-Cha first. I'll start this Thursday night--the comedy night. It sounds good, uh?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. It seems highly unusual to be offered a job but not be told what it entails."}, {"instruction": "Well, yes, but the circumstances were unusual. It's been a very strange and wonderful week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Please tell me about it."}, {"instruction": "At first, the only goal I had was to find my sweet little thing.", "input": "", "output": "I beg your pardon?"}, {"instruction": "The laugh--the \"ha, ha, ha.\" I wanted to find the man who laughed during my first routine. That way, I'd have been able to confront Neville Hurt and demand another try-out. It was a simple plan, but practical. Those are always the best.", "input": "", "output": "Darius, I don't think..."}, {"instruction": "No, you're right! The joke was on me. Tuesday night was Country-and-Western night. Who the hell was laughing? I think the band was called The Ho-Diddle-Fiddles--all grizzled beard and fancy brown frills, jumping and a-careening. It was like a cross between a Scout Jamboree and the slaughtering of an ox. I'll tell you this: whatever happens, job or no job, I will never again step foot inside The Cha-Cha on a Tuesday night.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Wednesday night was better. It seemed to be devoted to the mixed-grill. There's no entertainment, just beer and a selection of five different meats. The punters spent a quiet night moodily hunched over their consumption.", "input": "", "output": "And what about you, Darius? You were spending all your time in a pub. Were you drinking a lot?"}, {"instruction": "Oh no, I was all business.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been taking any other drugs?"}, {"instruction": "Not at all! I need a clear head. I had one, maybe two glasses of house red just for appearances. But if you ever call in to The Cha-Cha, Doctor Balis, I don't recommend the house red--a very nasty drop.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you for the warning."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, by late Wednesday night, Neville Hurt was becoming very uncomfortable with my presence there. He seems rather flighty for a manager. What's left of his hair won't lie down, it's always poking up in pluckable orangey-red tufts. I've noticed that a lot of the regulars there call him Fluff. He doesn't seem to mind.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think he was so upset with your presence there?"}, {"instruction": "At first, I thought he must be afraid I was there to cause trouble. But I kept telling him, \"Neville, just let me talk to the owner for a minute, then I'll happily leave and never come back.\" This seemed to freak him right out.", "input": "", "output": "What were you hoping to achieve by seeing the owner?"}, {"instruction": "I've no idea. But even mentioning the owner got such a reaction--Neville would start waving his arms around, and go on about how I didn't know what I was doing, and wouldn't I please, please just leave. He even offered me a free mixed-grill! I politely declined. The gravy reminded me of an overly long winter. Anyway, as I was having no luck finding my laugh, asking for the owner seemed the only course of action left.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And then came good old Thursday night--the comedy-night. The place was abuzz. The previous night's protein was kicking in. Bertie Buckmeister's arrival was imminent. Old men were recounting Pecker-boy's stiff-necked debauches. Old women were wondering how far it could go. I remained happily seated at my little table in the back corner, taking it all in. Then Neville came over and asked me to leave. I asked if I might see the owner for a moment. He lost it. He stood up straight as a broom, pointing at the door, screaming, \"Go! Go! Go!\" I stayed where I was, calmly humming to myself, \"At the Cha-Cha, Cha-Cha-crapola,\" until Pecker-boy appeared. He came up on the stage, from behind the curtain, as if on his own, with his wicked, stiffy grin and his limp, waggling limbs. The place filled with an eager roar. Neville ceased his imprecations. He turned to me and said curtly, \"See me after the show.\"", "input": "", "output": "It's possible, Darius, that the manager was trying to warn you off the place for your own good. Spending a lot of time in an environment like that is not good for your health--physical or mental."}, {"instruction": "But if I have a job there...", "input": "", "output": "Do you think it's wise to pin your hopes on a job when you don't even know what it is?"}, {"instruction": "You don't understand. It's not the job that matters. It's the way it came about.", "input": "", "output": "How did it come about?"}, {"instruction": "After the show, I found Neville. He was giving Bertie a pat on the back, telling him that tonight was possibly his best performance. I interrupted to ask Neville what he wanted to see me about. Looking over my shoulder, a bit sniffily, he said, \"Do you want to work here?\" I couldn't believe it! I could have jumped on him, but I played it cool. I said, \"That sounds like an interesting proposition. Perhaps I should first see the owner?\" Ha! That was a good one, uh?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Of course, I expected him to wig out. But he simply spun around and said, \"Follow me,\" and neatly zig-zagged his way back behind the bar. He was hard to keep up with. For one awful moment, as he paused beneath the rows of bottled spirits, I thought he might want me to tend the bar. I don't know a Bloody Mary from a Green Tree Frog. But he started off again, out through the kitchen--thank God, I didn't eat the mixed-grill--down a long narrow corridor, finally stopping at a door with a name \"Anne Cursaro.\"", "input": "", "output": "That was the owner of The Cha-Cha?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Did you meet her, Darius?"}, {"instruction": "I...", "input": "", "output": "Darius?"}, {"instruction": "Her office was so cluttered--papers, and books, and folders everywhere. She was behind a desk, almost hidden by towering columns of paperwork. She seemed trapped in there, like a small bird, a rather agitated bird. She was hunting about furiously for something. It was so intense, I felt like searching my own pockets. Suddenly, she looked up and said, \"Have you got a pencil?\" I didn't, but I couldn't just say \"no.\" After what seemed like a split-second and an eternity of missed opportunities, she made a sharp gesture of dismissal. Neville tapped me on the shoulder and whispered that it was time to go. It all seemed a bit rushed. I still can't help wondering what would have happened if I had a pencil. What would she have said?", "input": "", "output": "That was the extent of your meeting?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Just before the door closed, I saw her make a sudden, extravagant motion as if unsheathing a sword. Inwardly, I cried out. I thought I should go back in. But the door was shut, and Neville was tugging me down the corridor. I managed to loiter long enough to hear her talk sharply into what must have been a cordless phone or a walkie-talkie. She said, \"Joe? Where are the fucking pencils?\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "When we got back to the kitchen, Neville asked if I still wanted to work there. I said I most definitely did. He told me to report next Thursday at six pm.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Darius, I think you made the right decision not to quit your job with SII for the time being. I think you should be very cautious about any further involvement with The Cha-Cha. Go there on Thursday, see what happens, but don't rush into anything. Think things through."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'll definitely have to have my wits about me, that's for sure.", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Well, I'm afraid our time's up for today."}, {"instruction": "Is it? Time sure flies when you're on top of the world.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I sure hope so. See you then, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Darius."}]
