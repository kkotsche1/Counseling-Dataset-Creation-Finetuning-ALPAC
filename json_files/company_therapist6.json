My nightly ritual during that period of unemployment was to turn off all the lights in the apartment, light a candle on the coffee table, whip out the vodka and some depressing music, and drink until I was unconscious. I'm sure my mom thought I'd eventually kill myself. She lived with her boyfriend but kept the apartment for my brother and I to use when we were home from school. But she'd sometimes stop by to check up on me. I must have worried her to death. It came to the point that I realized my dreams weren't going to come true, and that I'd have to make the best of what I had. I took the part-time newspaper job greedily. I just didn't care anymore.

Sometimes when I'd come home from work, I'd find little love letters stuffed in my mailbox from Sharon. She was always doing things like that. That really made me feel special. Like I mattered. But, for me, there was always this underlying fear throughout the relationship. You see, Sharon was a senior in high school, and I knew that when she went to college, it would tear us apart. I was cognizant of the fact that I was living on borrowed time. Our break-up was inevitable. I had already seen this happen to other couples while I was in college. They just don't work.

I've always felt that going out and interacting with people in the social arena is a big game. There are a lot of people out there who are good at playing the game, and some score...in more ways than one, might I add. But that's all it is, really. I don't think people go out for the sake of going out to enjoy themselves. I think they do it for status. It's a test to see who can speak the most eloquently or be the most athletic.

She called me that night at my house and apologized again, saying she didn't realize she had done so much damage to my car. I told her it was okay, no harm done, these things happen. Then she kept going on and on about how nice I had been to her in light of the situation and how she hates this city and all the traffic and that she's going to take a different route from now on.

Maybe it was just wishful thinking. She was somewhat attractive--seemed a little older than me, but attractive, nevertheless.  Except she smoked. I hate smokers. I wasn't looking for rings on her fingers at the time, so I have no idea if she was actually married. I guess it's just nice to imagine that she really was interested in me.

Hell, I don't even know if I could go through a relationship again.  I mean, it's pretty stifling, isn't it? I'm too used to living alone now.  I'd have to make too many compromises. I don't expect a woman to move in on the first date, mind you, but you know it's inevitable. And I don't know if I could deal with that.

I'd walk into his room and see him all bandaged up--didn't even seem like my dad anymore. He couldn't speak, but could move one arm, and he'd motion it like he'd want me to come to him, but I couldn't. I was scared. My brother would go up to him and talk to him like there was nothing wrong. He'd keep asking, \"When are you coming home, Daddy?\" like he couldn't see the bandages or something.

Mom was the first person to walk into the viewing area and she collapsed right there. She spent two nights in a psychiatric hospital after that. My aunt Denise went to see her and told me years later that Mom had been completely oblivious to everything. She didn't even know Denise had been there.

All we ever did was play checkers and Connect Four and then she'd throw a few ink blots on the table and ask me what I saw in them. It should have been obvious to everyone why I couldn't keep my mind on my school work. My Dad had just died, for Christ's sake. All I ever thought about was death. I remember looking at all my classmates one day when suddenly they turned into skeletons. I used to believe that I had x-ray eyes, that I could see through them. I could see through the whole world.

And there was this strange glow around him, like someone was shining a spotlight over his head. He'd just sit there, grinning. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't seem to take my eyes off him. It was like all the darkness in the room somehow focused on my Dad. I remember trying to scream out to my Mom but I was too petrified to make any sound. Then I'd pull the covers up over my head and close my eyes tight, as if that would protect me from him.", "input": "", "output": "What would happen then?"}, {"instruction": "My brother slept on the bottom bunk. I'd concentrate on his snoring--it seemed to drown out the sound of my heart thumping away. Then I'd eventually fall asleep. The next morning, I'd peek out from under my covers and Dad was always gone by then. This went on about once a week for the next month. That's when I started seeing the doctor. Five months later, I was on Ritalin and the visions stopped. But so did everything else. I had no imagination at that point. I lost about 10 pounds. I'd try to eat, but everything tasted like ashes. My grades didn't really improve. I shut down. I was on and off the drug for nearly two years. It was like they couldn't make up their mind. Finally, I just stopped taking it.", "input": "", "output": "What happened after you stopped taking the medication?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. So many things were happening by that time. Mom had met the jerk she'd eventually marry, then we moved to Scranton and I was trying to cope with being the new kid at school, then I had to put up with my stepfather and all his crap. I closed inward, I guess. My grades stabilized, but I wasn't making any friends. It was not a great time to be alive. It's pretty easy to see that that's about the time I began avoiding any type of unnecessary social interaction. After I had transferred to the new school, I started skipping class regularly. You want to know which class I skipped, Charles?", "input": "", "output": "Which one?"}, {"instruction": "Lunch, Charles. Lunch! While everyone else was munching on soy burgers and PBJs, I was hiding out in the bathroom. Had my technique down pat. Whenever someone would come in, I'd stand in front of the urinal like I was doing my business, and I'd just stick around until they had left. Sometimes I'd have to get a little more creative if it was the principal coming in to take a prolonged dump, but I never got caught. I couldn't stand being in a cafeteria full of hundreds of kids I didn't know, Charles. It scared me to death.", "input": "", "output": "How long did this go on?"}, {"instruction": "A few months. Eventually, a few people even less popular than I took me under their wing. I sat at their table in the cafeteria, but I was still petrified. I couldn't get up to get something to eat. I'd just sit there and wait for the period to end. Then everyone would leave at once and I could stand up and blend with the crowd. I felt okay if I was assured I was just a number in the masses, but if there was any chance that I'd somehow get singled out, I'd panic.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever get singled out?"}, {"instruction": "Well, no, but the threat was always there.", "input": "", "output": "Who was a threat?"}, {"instruction": "Everybody! My teachers, my classmates, the cooks, the bus driver--they were all a threat to me. I never knew how to react to attention. If my teachers called on me, usually I'd just freeze up, couldn't even talk. Or if someone yelled hello to me in the hallways between class, I'd ignore them.", "input": "", "output": "Why? What do you think made you respond like that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't really know, Charles. I suppose I was afraid. I didn't want to be picked on again. I didn't want to say something stupid or give the wrong answer or draw any sort of attention to myself. It was comfortable being obscure and anonymous. I felt it gave me freedom. A freedom I now have an overabundance of, I might add.", "input": "", "output": "So, initially, you enjoyed the freedom of obscurity."}, {"instruction": "I wouldn't say I enjoyed it necessarily, I just felt less threatened in that state.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, my strategy would backfire. Being very quiet and unresponsive to the things around you makes people nervous, I've found. There was a kid in the sixth grade who used to try to rile me. Sometimes he'd stick thumbtacks on my chair and wait for me to sit down. Ouch. Other times he'd criticize my Prince Valiant haircut or call me a sissy. He sat in the seat behind me. I knew my shyness really bothered him.", "input": "", "output": "People's initial reaction to anything or anyone they don't understand is usually fear, Tom. His actions were most likely a result of that fear."}, {"instruction": "So I have heard so many of you shrinks say. But it was all right after awhile. I got him back.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "I super glued his ass to the chair.", "input": "", "output": "You what?"}, {"instruction": "Planned it all out. Brought in the super glue, made sure no one was looking, squirted a bunch of it onto his seat, then very casually wrapped up the tube in a piece of notebook paper and threw it away.", "input": "", "output": "So he couldn't get up from his seat?"}, {"instruction": "Oh he got up, all right. By the time the class was over and it was time to move on to the next period, that glue had plenty of time to set up just right. When he stood up, his pants let out the loudest ripping noise I've ever heard. I was just about out the door when he got up, but it felt great to hear the laughter behind me. The teacher demanded the next day that whomever did the deed come forward or the whole class would suffer the consequences. Like I cared. Fuck them all. Naturally the asshole accused me, but do you think that Ms. Watson believed it? Hell no. She couldn't see that I was capable of doing something like that. I was too much of a little angel in her eyes. And that's just my point. It's all about society's perceptions of you and how much they impact your life. My teacher didn't want to believe I was capable of such mischief because I didn't fit the mold.", "input": "", "output": "Were you trying to get revenge on the bully or were you rebelling against the perceptions that your teachers and peers had of you?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I guess I never really thought about that. I suppose maybe unconsciously I was sick of everyone else around me making their assumptions about what type of person I was, based on my lack of interaction with them. I honestly don't know. All I know is that's the only time in my life, besides my days with John, that I actually took a stand on something.", "input": "", "output": "John?"}, {"instruction": "My stepfather.", "input": "", "output": "Ah, yes. Well, it appears our time is just about up. Would you mind if we discussed him next week?"}, {"instruction": "Wouldn't mind at all. And, Charles, thanks a lot for today, really. I came in here acting kind of like an ass and you really helped me get a hold of myself.", "input": "", "output": "Venting frustrations can be a constructive thing, if done properly, Tom."}, {"instruction": "True. See you next week, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Next week it is, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Charles?", "input": "", "output": "Oh hello, Tom. Sorry. Come on in and have a seat while I put these away."}, {"instruction": "Taxes, eh?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. I've been putting these forms off for too long."}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess that's one good thing about being poor--takes two minutes to fill out the EZ form and then it's off to the mailbox. I don't have to worry about factoring in all those pesky investments like stocks and CDs and so forth. I've already received my refund. Now I can finally afford those dirt floors I've always dreamed about.", "input": "", "output": "How was your week? Free of ritual killings, I trust?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, no murderous rages this week. There's only so many ways you can reheat leftover girl scouts, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Isn't that the truth."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, I apologize again for being so snappy toward you during the last session. That was really inexcusable.", "input": "", "output": "Nothing to be sorry for, Tom. I admire the way you handle your frustration, in a way. Your sardonic style of humor seems to increase proportionately to your anger. Actually, I find it very healthy."}, {"instruction": "Just a shame I have to be angry to get a few laughs. So where were we last week?", "input": "", "output": "Well, your brief references these past few sessions to your stepfather obviously paint a very grim picture. Tell me about him."}, {"instruction": "I really shouldn't give him any more airtime than he deserves, but I'll tell you what you want to know: he was the most twisted son-of-a-bitch who ever slithered his way into our lives. When I think back on him, I'm reminded of that drill sergeant from the movie \"Full Metal Jacket.\" Except John was short and bald. Maybe that's what his problem was: he had a short complex. Always barking out orders, made us call him \"Sir.\" But I'd be damned before I ever called him \"Dad.\" He didn't deserve such an honor.", "input": "", "output": "Was he in the military himself?"}, {"instruction": "Army sergeant. He was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam. I'm not too familiar with the particulars of exactly how he went from Captain to a non-commissioned officer, but the gist of it was that the Army had had a surplus of officers during the war and solved the problem by demoting many of them. About twelve years ago, he was able to sue the government over it and received a settlement, but that came after Mom's divorce, conveniently enough. Anyway, I think the demotion made him bitter. He was a very angry man, and I only refer to him as a man for gender purposes.", "input": "", "output": "Your mother met him two years after your father's death?"}, {"instruction": "Right. They met at a county fair, of all places. His two sons were participating in some equestrian event or something, I can't exactly remember what. John was originally from Texas, you see, and I guess he had lived on a small ranch at one time, so that's how he brought up his kids. Mom worked with John's sister and she sort of set the two up. I wish that'd never happened. Mom brought us to the fair and introduced my brother and me to him, and immediately I sensed something phony about John, like he was putting on some kind of an act. The bad thing was Mom fell for it.", "input": "", "output": "What was it about him that tipped you off?"}, {"instruction": "Just his mannerisms. It was like he didn't really know how to be nice. The things he said sounded awkward, even to a kid. The clincher in my mind was when he sat me down and had this \"man-to-man\" talk with me, saying how much he wanted us all to be together as a family and how much he loved my mother. Keep in mind they had only dated for about a month. Everything during that time seemed to be happening way too fast, and it was pretty obvious that Mom was being caught up in his lies.", "input": "", "output": "How long was their courtship?"}, {"instruction": "Well, let's see. They met in July and were married in November. About four months. Four months! I don't know what Mom was thinking.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps your Mom was trying to keep the best interests of you and your brother in mind when she made the decision. She may have thought having a father figure in your life would benefit the both of you. How old were John's two sons?"}, {"instruction": "David, the oldest, was 19 at the time. Lynn was 17. They were almost as abusive as John. It was like they were tentacles of him, and even when he wasn't around, Dave and Lynn would be right there to take up where he left off. Dave was definitely the worst of the two, though. At least Lynn had some sense of humanity to him. He'd sometimes stick up for us, but then other times he'd just wig out.", "input": "", "output": "What sort of abuse did you endure?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it wasn't sexual, but when I think back on a couple incidents I think it's possible John tried. It was physical and psychological. He really knew how to get under your skin. I guess they teach that in the military. The abuse didn't start until shortly before Mom and John's wedding. One day I was in a light argument with my Mom, when all of a sudden I felt this sharp pain in my ass. John had kicked me as hard as he could, and he was wearing cowboy boots at the time. A little safety tip, Charles: asses and cowboy boots don't mix.", "input": "", "output": "What was your mother's reaction?"}, {"instruction": "She trusted his judgment by that point. Mom gave me a \"you deserved it\" look and that was that. She told us later that John would help teach us discipline.", "input": "", "output": "Did he abuse your younger brother, too?"}, {"instruction": "Alex? Yes, but I tried to shield him from it when I could. I mean, I didn't physically get in between John and my brother when Alex was being hit, but I would do things to make John focus his attentions on me in general.", "input": "", "output": "How often did the abuse occur?"}, {"instruction": "After the marriage, it was pretty much daily. John had his prize so he didn't have to put on a show anymore. He had us pack our things and we all moved to an army base near Scranton. The housing situation was awful. The place was pretty run-down, and I remember this lingering odor in all the rooms, like maybe there was once a fire. I hear you can never get that musty, smoky smell out of a house that's had a fire, so that's probably what had happened. It was a three-bedroom apartment, so Dave and Lynn shared a room and Alex and I shared one. I think that was the one good thing about the whole situation, because Alex and I could commiserate. I remember how every night, we'd plan out how to murder John and move back to Swiftwater. We'd entertain ourselves with new ways of killing him. Alex got the bright idea to slice off his legs and then stand the limbs up in the middle of the living room with \"these boots are made for walking\" scrawled in blood on one wall.", "input": "", "output": "What else would John do?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he had these really strict rituals that we needed to abide by every day. Like the beds had to be made so tightly that they'd pass that stupid bouncing quarter test. What's with that anyway? How is not making your bed a danger to national security? I've never heard of soldiers getting killed because the sheets on their bed weren't tight enough. Anyway, if they didn't pass that test, he'd tear them apart and send us back to our room to redo them--he didn't care if we missed the school bus or not. Then he'd beat our asses raw until we got it right. Alex and I started using safety pins to pin the sheets to the mattress. Kind of a crude trick but it worked. Then there was dinner. John was very particular about our behavior at the dinner table. Dave and Lynn sat at one end of the table while Mom and Alex sat on either side of John. I sat next to my Mom. We weren't permitted to sit back in our chairs: we had to sit on the very edge of the seat and keep our backs straight. He'd go around the table to make sure everyone was doing this. If he caught you sitting back in your chair, he'd use one of those long bread knives to slap the exposed part of your ass. When he sat down, we all had to pass our plates over to him. He decided what you ate and how much. John knew exactly what foods each of us liked and didn't like--he had found that out during his \"nice\" stage. Once he knew that I liked mashed potatoes and gravy, he made sure I never got any. When he realized that Alex and I hated hot peppers on our steak sandwiches, he'd put extra heaps of them on the bun and make us eat every bite. One night we had chicken--everybody got a decent piece of meat except for me. He gave me the chicken neck and made me eat that. Strict table manners had to be adhered to at all times. If we were chewing, we weren't allowed to hold our forks. The knife had to be resting at a 12 o'clock position on the plate when it wasn't in use. Alex learned the table manners well, because John kept him close enough to slap a spoon hard onto his head if he did something wrong. I remember one day when it was Alex's birthday, John started going off on him, slapping him silly until he was crying, then sent him up to his room without dinner. It turned out that John only did that so that my Mom would have time to bring out the birthday cake. So when John called Alex back down, the lights had been turned off and the candles were lit and everyone was singing \"Happy Birthday.\" My brother still had tears streaming down his face. John beat us around a lot, sure, but it was the head games like that incident that really affected us.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like he was a very disturbed individual. You mentioned a couple incidents that you believe could have turned into sexually abusive situations. Can you tell me about them?"}, {"instruction": "John liked to prove his manliness a lot by wrestling around, even it if was with someone much younger and obviously weaker like me and Alex. One time he grabbed me while I was doing one of my daily chores and pinned me down. I kept telling him to stop, to get off me. \"Quit squirming,\" he yelled. He pulled my pants down. I started crying. Finally he picked me up, walked me toward the front door and threw me outside, with my pants still hanging at my knees. He thought this was extremely funny. Another time, I walked up to my bedroom to find John standing over Alex as he slept. John was wearing just his robe and he was just staring down at my brother. He wasn't looking at him like my Mom would look at us. He looked like a predator. It really sent chills through me. Then he suddenly turned and realized I was there. \"What the fuck are you staring at?\" he yelled. My brother woke up and immediately cowered into a little ball with the pillow in front of him.", "input": "", "output": "Have you talked to your brother about this and the possibility of abuse?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, we discussed it. He says nothing like that ever happened. I sure hope so. Jesus! John really dicked us all. I hope that sick son of a bitch is dead now.", "input": "", "output": "Obviously the level of abuse escalated as time went on. How was your mother taking all this?"}, {"instruction": "She blocked it all out. She was sort of like a robot. When we'd tell her what John would do to us, she'd say things like, \"there's nothing wrong. Everything's fine.\" It was so mechanical how she said it. Like she had been brainwashed.", "input": "", "output": "Was she also abused?"}, {"instruction": "In a different way. John and Mom's bedroom was right next to ours, so we could hear things. Many nights, I'd hear my Mom screaming, telling John to stop. Now, I know the difference between orgasmic screams and those of someone in distress, and I tell you Mom was not having a good time. He'd wrestle around with her and stick the pillow over her face and do who knows what else. Plus he was cheating on her. He was screwing around with some bimbo who worked at the officer's club. But what really scared the piss out of me was something Aunt Denise had told me. I guess John was screening Mom's phone calls, listening in to her conversations and generally being possessive. Denise said that one night Mom called her and said that she feared for her life. I guess she was finally beginning to realize what kind of nut John really was.", "input": "", "output": "Was it at that point that your mother sought a divorce?"}, {"instruction": "No. Actually, it was more John's doing. He told her that he was being assigned to a different housing area, which was large enough only for him and his two sons. So he had Mom, Alex and me move back to our apartment in Swiftwater \"temporarily.\" What John was really doing was making his apartment available for the bitch from the officer's club. Needless to say, we never moved back in with John. Mom filed for divorce about a month later.", "input": "", "output": "So how long were they married?"}, {"instruction": "About two years.", "input": "", "output": "Well, obviously there's a lot of animosity that has been generated from this episode in your life, and clearly the fact that your stepfather's abuse, compounded by the new surroundings and your adjustment to a new school, played a role in the development of your social behavior. I know replaying those events today in your mind must have rekindled some of that hatred. I'd like to delve more into this anger and perhaps, in time, we can try to manage it together."}, {"instruction": "Sure. Maybe we can hunt him down and stick his head on a pike. I think we could manage my anger a lot better after that.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure we could, but I make it a point not to conduct sessions with iron bars separating me from my clients."}, {"instruction": "Good point. See you next week, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Hi Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Is anything the matter? You look tired."}, {"instruction": "I'm okay.", "input": "", "output": "Have a seat."}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "So how have we been this week?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, we've been fine.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure you're feeling alright--have you been getting enough sleep?"}, {"instruction": "Honestly, I'm...", "input": "", "output": "Because you don't look too well."}, {"instruction": "Nothing's...", "input": "", "output": "I could get you some coffee or some water or..."}, {"instruction": "No I'm fine, believe me.", "input": "", "output": "Very well."}, {"instruction": "[Laughs].", "input": "", "output": "What? What are you chuckling about?"}, {"instruction": "Just life, Charles. The whole idea of it.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you have something on your mind."}, {"instruction": "You ever wonder what a copy machine thinks, Charles?", "input": "", "output": "Come again?"}, {"instruction": "A couple days ago while I was at work and was using the copier, I imagined what it would be like to be the machine. All those reports, all those spec sheets and tables, copy after copy, day after day, nothing changing except for the text and the paper size. It accomplishes so much but for all it does to make our lives easier, it's probably the least appreciated device in the department. People take it for granted. We expect it to always be there for us--we never stop to think that it might need another ream of paper or a toner cartridge occasionally.", "input": "", "output": "You're beginning to feel like the copy machine."}, {"instruction": "Am I that transparent?", "input": "", "output": "Everyone feels that way from time to time. You think there aren't times when I don't feel appreciated? We all have days when we wonder if what we're doing really matters to anyone. There are six billion people on this planet, Tom. That number rises each decade. It becomes more and more difficult to separate the single voice from the masses. But regardless, each of us is unique and has something special to offer."}, {"instruction": "I'm not so sure. I want to be that person in the spotlight; I want to be recognized for my achievements.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "But, I'm afraid.", "input": "", "output": "Because if you were to be recognized for your deeds, it would mean enduring the pressure of being singled out from the crowd."}, {"instruction": "Exactly. Am I contradicting myself here? Why is it that I want to bask in the glory yet at the same time hide in the shadows? I do a lot at work. There are many problems I solve behind the scenes while others accept credit for the work they do and get recognized for their achievements. Damn it, it's not fair. If I were just more outgoing, things would be different.", "input": "", "output": "You're not contradicting yourself, but you are challenging yourself, and that's good. I would be more worried if you were content with being perpetually anonymous. I think if you continue to challenge yourself actively--socially--you'd be surprised at what you could accomplish. You're shaking your head. You don't believe me?"}, {"instruction": "You don't know my past history in the social department, Charles. I've had a lot of bad luck during the times I actually do go out, almost as if I weren't meant to be around people. It just seems that every time I try to peek out of my shell, there's something waiting to bite my head off.", "input": "", "output": "Something happened this week, didn't it?"}, {"instruction": "Jesus, Charles, you must be able to see the wall behind me when you look into my eyes. Yeah, something happened.", "input": "", "output": "You want to talk about it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's no big deal, I guess. It's just amazing to me how strange things seem to happen only when I make an attempt at socializing. Last week at work, a couple guys who sit near me were talking about the big scandal with our VP.", "input": "", "output": "Scandal?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe I shouldn't really talk about it. Let's just say that there were rumors about this woman's involvement with some people in the department and recently the rumors were confirmed in a big way. In any case, eventually I started participating in the conversation just to be, you know, one of the guys, and then we started talking about going out after work for a few beers. No biggie. Rob, a friend of mine who sits in the cube next to me at work, basically talked me into going. We used to hang out together more often than we do now, which is never. I think he doesn't fully understand how uncomfortable it is for me when I go out in public. But, he's probably the closest friend I have, so I agreed to tag along. We went to The Bull Market after work--it's that little bar and grill with the Old West-type atmosphere down the street, across from the Pacific Stock Exchange.", "input": "", "output": "I've been there a few times. Good food."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, the more grease, the better. Anyway, Rob, Chad and I stayed there a lot later than we should have for a Monday night. Between the three of us, I think we had about seven or eight pitchers of beer. Some other people from work were also sitting nearby and Chad, well, he's sort of the company hound dog--hitting on anything remotely feminine and all. He decides to walk over and start talking with a girl from work whom we all know is very married. Another hour passes, and Rob and I are busy complaining about work and about our ex-girlfriends and about a thousand other topics that start spewing out of your mouth when the alcohol hits your brain. Chad's still working on this girl when her husband walks in. The husband is pretty cool at first, sits down near us and joins in on a conversation nearby, while all the time keeping an eye on his wife and Chad. Now, I don't know what the hell Chad was thinking next, but before we knew it, the girl was heading toward the ladies room and Chad was following her in! Rob suddenly says to me, \"Uh oh,\" and I turn around to see the husband right in Chad's face. At first they were shoving each other around and shouting obscenities--the bartender and a couple cooks were trying to break it up--then all of sudden the two of them were rolling around on the floor bashing each other's head in. Rob's the type of guy who will instinctively go out of his way to mediate disputes, so he gets up and pulls the two of them apart. I don't know how he did it, but while he was holding back the husband, who was still flailing away, he was able to talk to Chad and calm him down. It looked like the trouble was over.", "input": "", "output": "But they started fighting again?"}, {"instruction": "No, the cops arrived. As soon as Rob saw the cops, he sort of mumbled, \"You guys are on your own now\" and let go of the husband, who immediately leaps toward Chad. The police officers grab the husband and try to get him to calm down, when all of a sudden he throws a punch at the one of the cops! I couldn't believe my eyes. The four cops pin the guy down to the floor and spray mace in his face. Then they handcuff him and arrest him for resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a very entertaining evening!"}, {"instruction": "It was shocking. Obviously, the whole place sort of became subdued after that--with the smell of mace in the air, we all got out of there. I really think that Janet--the girl--was sort of egging the whole episode on. Rob and I walked out to the parking lot and had nothing to say to each other, we were so stunned. As we approached our cars, we just sort of looked at each other and shook our heads.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel somehow responsible for causing the fight?"}, {"instruction": "Well, no. I didn't know Janet, after all.", "input": "", "output": "No, I mean do you feel that if you hadn't accepted Rob's offer to join him for a few drinks, that the fight would not have occurred?"}, {"instruction": "I know it sounds crazy, but yes I do. Based on everything else that's happened to me, I really do believe that somehow this episode was related to my being there. I mean, I had been interacting with Chad that night, perhaps something I had said at the table prompted him to get up and start hitting on women, I don't know. But I definitely believe that my presence somehow evokes negative forces. To me, it makes complete sense, Charles. The world is, after all, made up of positive and negative energy, and our existence is based on their perfect balance. I feel that, for whatever reason, I was destined to be a negative force. I emit negative vibes. Not literally, of course, but socially. Somehow, I affect those around me. And it's for that reason that I believe I should just stay home and not deal with it.", "input": "", "output": "I believe you're being a bit unrealistic about that. You're needlessly accepting responsibility for the actions of others around you. Don't you think the alcohol most likely played more of a role here than anything else?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I definitely agree that the beer had a great deal to do with it, but I also feel that makes us even more vulnerable to those around us in terms of social pressures. Basically I either make people upset or I simply push them away. I somehow bring out their negative side, and they act it out in strange ways. One time last year, Amanda and her boyfriend, Trent--I work with both of them--invited me to their party. I was really, really afraid, Charles. But I decided to be strong. I tried to overcome my fear of people and accept the invitation. I was one of the first ones to arrive there, which was easier for me. I feel more comfortable being the first instead of showing up when there's a million people stumbling around. I was still very, very nervous. I remember breaking out in a cold sweat and trying to come up with things to say to the few who were there. The first hour, I drank about five or six glasses of beer from the keg just to calm myself down. Later that night, as the group grew to a crowd, I became increasingly drunk. There are many periods of the night that I don't even remember. From what Rob tells me, I was having a good time. He said I was making a lot of the women nervous because I was going around trying to kiss them all. Anyway, I passed out. Well, at a party, you wouldn't think this was such a big deal. When I awoke, it was about 4:30 and I'm laying on a couch in Amanda's apartment and it's pitch black and I have no idea how I got there. The last thing I remembered was playing darts with Trent. So I look at my arms, and notice that someone had written all kinds of words and designs on them in magic marker. I got up and went to the bathroom, and realized there was also marker designs on my face. Someone had even written \"cute butt\" in magic-marker on one of the back pockets of my jeans.", "input": "", "output": "How did this make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I felt like crying. I felt like I had been betrayed. These were my friends. These were people I thought I could trust. But there I was, getting picked on again, just like when I was the new kid in Scranton. There were so many people at the party that night, and I finally felt comfortable and felt like I fit in, and then I wake up and realize that, while I was passed out, I was made the outcast once again. I didn't know what to do at that point. I just grabbed my keys and drove home.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk to Rob or Trent about what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, they thought I was overreacting. Rob didn't think it was a big deal. He told me how his frat brothers used to put makeup on him when he passed out and sat him on a chair in an elevator so passengers could see. It wasn't too comforting to me. I don't think he can possibly understand where I'm coming from. It's not fun for me to go out. It's work. I have to concentrate hard on socializing. I have to prepare. And when someone does something like that to me, it gives me less incentive to continue to go out.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. Tom, I'm convinced you're not a negative force. These incidents aren't happening because you're somehow influencing others around you to act out against you. There is, however, such a thing as a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you feel that something negative will happen, it will happen, Tom. It is a chore sometimes to be positive, but it can be done. Think on that."}, {"instruction": "I will.", "input": "", "output": "And all your socializing involves large amounts of alcohol.  People tend to act unconventionally when they're drunk.  Anyway, I'll say this: you definitely look better now than you did coming in here."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I seem to feel a lot better talking about this stuff than letting it cycle through my own head every day.", "input": "", "output": "Talking is a start. Acting on what we've discussed will come later."}, {"instruction": "I look forward to it.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week?  Is Friday, April 18th at this time okay for you?"}, {"instruction": "That'll be fine.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, then.  See you later, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Only a little while. I know I'm early.", "input": "", "output": "Where are my keys? Oh, here they are. Bear with me a second while I unlock the door."}, {"instruction": "No problem.", "input": "", "output": "Did you take some extra time off from work or something?"}, {"instruction": "I took the day off.", "input": "", "output": "Here we are. Let me flip on the lights. Come on in and have a seat."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "I apologize that you had to wait out there; I'm usually loitering around the office most of the day, but I had to make a few errands this time."}, {"instruction": "I understand. It wasn't your fault I was early.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been ill?"}, {"instruction": "Why do you ask?", "input": "", "output": "Well, you said you took the day off. I assumed you were sick."}, {"instruction": "No, not really. Just a little hung-over. I've had a lot on my mind lately.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Is it a subject you want to discuss?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, Charles. It's really nothing new. I usually go through this cycle about once or twice a month. This is the first time I've called in sick because of it.", "input": "", "output": "Cramps?"}, {"instruction": "No, not that kind of cycle. Clever.", "input": "", "output": "It was a stretch as far as humor goes, but what do you expect on a lazy Friday afternoon?"}, {"instruction": "I just go through this period of...I don't know how to describe it--mourning.", "input": "", "output": "What is it exactly you do during these periods of mourning, besides drink?"}, {"instruction": "I do a lot of reflecting. Looking back into the past, remembering people. Remembering Sharon.", "input": "", "output": "Your ex-girlfriend."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "You spoke of her briefly during our first meeting, if I recall. Perhaps we could discuss your relationship with her further. How long were the two of you involved with each other?"}, {"instruction": "One year, seven months, almost to the day. We met February 22, 1994.", "input": "", "output": "How did the two of you meet?"}, {"instruction": "I had been working at the newspaper for a little over a month. There was a guy downstairs, in customer service, who I met in the lunchroom. We started meeting regularly. I was comfortable talking with him. Jay was about five years younger than I was and a bit slow for his age, but not so much that he didn't realize how anti-social I was. Anyway, I guess he pitied me in a way. I think he had initially tried to befriend me thinking that I was this older partying stud who could hook him up with some beer and invite him to parties or something. As it turned out, he actually took me under his wing. His fianc\u00e9's best friend had just broken up with her boyfriend and one day he talked me into going out with her on a blind double date.", "input": "", "output": "You were how old at the time?"}, {"instruction": "Twenty-two.", "input": "", "output": "And Sharon was?"}, {"instruction": "Well, all right. I know I originally told you she was eighteen, but I didn't want to make a big issue out of her age. She was actually 16 when we first met. Fortunately, the age of consent in Pennsylvania is 14, so I wasn't breaking any laws.", "input": "", "output": "That fact wasn't much of a consolation to you, I imagine."}, {"instruction": "No, it wasn't. Jay had originally told me she was 18 and a senior in high school, which in my mind was still too young. But then, only twenty minutes before Sharon and Crystal--that's Jay's fianc\u00e9--pulled up into the driveway to meet with us, Jay takes me aside and whispers, \"I lied about her age, man. She's actually 16, but she turns 17 in May.\" I was so shocked that I wanted to sprint to my car and drive off, but then I thought, \"This is only a date. It's not like we're going to get married or anything.\" So I decided to stick around and just go through with it and try to have a good time. Besides, I was very lonely and very bored and welcomed any opportunity to get out of the house.", "input": "", "output": "How did the date go?"}, {"instruction": "It went about as well as most first dates go. A bit awkward, especially since I'm so quiet. It was bad enough that Sharon was so young, but to top it off, I noticed she wore braces. That just seemed to punctuate the age difference. The four of us went out to one of those miniature golf courses and hit some putts, then we bought the girls some ice cream and headed out to see a movie. We saw \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\" I was very nervous sitting next to Sharon, but thankful that I was in a place where I wasn't expected to talk. Anyway, we returned to Jay's house and said our goodbyes; Crystal asked if I could drive Sharon home, so I did. I tried my best to make small talk with her on the way to her house until finally I said, \"I know I'm probably the oldest guy you've ever dated.\" To my surprise, she said I wasn't. Then she told me she was much more comfortable around older men, which put me more at ease. In fact, after our little chat in the car, I realized I really liked this girl. She was funny, smart, friendly, and loved to smile. That was one of the most exhilarating evenings I had ever had with a girl. She made me forget my pain and my insecurities. I kept her number and called her back a few days later. We started chatting over the phone--talked for hours at a time--and went out more and more frequently. In less than a month, we were a couple. My life seemed to change for the better at that point. I became a lot more optimistic for the future. I quit drinking entirely. Things seemed to fall into place.", "input": "", "output": "How did her parents react to your relationship with their young daughter?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think they had too much of a problem with it. When I found out a little more about Sharon's past, I began to see why. I think her parents believed for a while that I'd settle her down a bit. She was very...wild. She had probably slept with more men than most women do in a lifetime. Her past boyfriend had gotten her pregnant and she promptly got an abortion. Jay and Crystal, in fact, were getting married because he had gotten Crystal pregnant. I think Sharon regretted aborting her child, especially since Crystal and she conceived at about the same time. After Crystal's baby was born, it really affected Sharon. We'd visit with her and the baby a lot, and Sharon took to it immediately. Needless to say, that made me nervous.", "input": "", "output": "Because you were uncomfortable with the idea of having sexual relations with someone her age?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no. I overcame that hangup fairly quickly. A few weeks later, after the braces came off, Sharon seemed a lot older to me. We had a very active sex life. Four or five times a week was pretty much the norm throughout the course of the relationship, and sometimes we'd have a go at it a few times a day. I definitely know where all my gray hairs come from. I was more concerned that she would try to get herself pregnant, like \"forget\" to take her birth control or something. It would have been ugly if that happened. I wasn't ready for a child, and I certainly didn't want to see Sharon ruin her life by having a kid while still in high school.", "input": "", "output": "She never got pregnant, I gather."}, {"instruction": "There were a couple of times that she was late, but they were always false alarms. We lucked out.", "input": "", "output": "Was the relationship fairly stable?"}, {"instruction": "I would say so. It got to be pretty routine. After I quit my part-time newspaper job and started working full time at the computer company, we lost a lot of time together. That sort of put a strain on us, but we managed. We began to appreciate our time together more on weekends. During the week, she would either greet me when I came home from work, or drop love letters in my mailbox. Then I'd drive over to her parent's house and stay with her until late in the evening. We'd wait until her parents were asleep and then make love in the living room. I remember driving home from her house some nights happily smelling my fingers...well, never mind.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right."}, {"instruction": "I loved her very much. After nearly a year, I began to see her as the person with whom I'd like to spend the rest of my life with. We talked a lot about marriage and I really began to look forward to that possibility, despite the fact that I knew it couldn't happen. College loomed ever nearer for Sharon. I've seen too many relationships end in college to think that our relationship was going to last. I even told Sharon that once. She assured me it wouldn't happen, but...I knew.", "input": "", "output": "How did your relationship end? Was it a clean break?"}, {"instruction": "No. In fact, Sharon will have nothing to do with me now. She won't even speak to me. She broke up with me after only a week in college. Maybe it had something to do with that self-fulfilling prophecy you were telling me about last week, I don't know. The college she ended up going to was only a ten-minute drive from my house. I caught her walking from her dining hall to her dorm room with another guy one night when we were supposed to go out. He was tall, long black hair, tanned and was visually undressing Sharon when I intercepted them in the lobby of her dorm. I knew it was over when Sharon introduced me to the guy as \"my friend, Tom.\" Not \"boyfriend\" or \"honey bunny\" or \"sweet cakes\" or anything, just \"friend.\" My heart crushed inward at that moment. He realized who I was and immediately left, and Sharon and I started fighting. I told her that if she wanted to break up with me she should say so. So she did, and that was that. I got in my car, bought a case of beer, and bawled my eyes out.", "input": "", "output": "Why did she stop speaking to you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that was my doing. After the breakup, we still got together once in a while and went out, but we were no longer intimate with each other. She'd call every now and then and we'd talk as friends but I needed more. I was horribly distraught after the breakup. I wrote her letters, sent her cards and flowers, anything to let her know that I still loved her and wanted her back in my life. But she kept toying with me. She'd come over to my house sometimes and give me mixed signals, like hug me, and pinch my ass or kiss me--it was very confusing. It would have been better to just stop seeing each other rather than being together but yet not as a couple. I couldn't handle it. Finally, out of frustration and rage, I took all of her love letters, highlighted certain parts of them and wrote nasty comments in the margins. I then collected them all and mailed them to her in a large manila envelope. Her phone calls to me immediately ceased. I finally called her about a month later to see how she was doing, but she screamed at me and told me I was a psycho and to stop calling her and to stay out of her life.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "No. And I know it was wrong. Sometimes I'd call her number and hang up, or leave cryptic messages on her answering machine. One time I drove out to her campus and stood outside her dorm window for about two hours.", "input": "", "output": "What were you doing?"}, {"instruction": "Just staring. Trying to catch a glimpse of her as she walked past. It made me feel close to her in a strange way. Jesus, maybe I am psychotic. I mean, that's called stalking, isn't it? I was stalking her. I think back on that and it really scares me what was going through my head.", "input": "", "output": "Was this something you did for a long time?"}, {"instruction": "No, just that once.", "input": "", "output": "And when was that?"}, {"instruction": "That was about a year and a half ago.  So do you think maybe that's what I am, Charles? Am I a stalker?", "input": "", "output": "It's difficult to pigeonhole a person into one particular category like that, Tom. Society likes to classify certain types of behavior in neat, tidy packages with bright, colorful labels, but the reality is that there are many circumstances involving many types of people that don't fit these molds. My interpretation of a stalker involves a high level of malice aimed at another person. You may have altered the love letters out of spite, but that type of revenge is a somewhat natural response to being hurt, although your method might have been a bit unconventional."}, {"instruction": "I would never hurt Sharon. I just missed her, you know? I felt like she betrayed me. I still wish she'd forgive me and talk to me again.", "input": "", "output": "Of course you do. But I feel the best thing you can do is get your mind off Sharon and out of the past. Try occupying yourself with other activities.  That's the only way you're going to overcome these cycles you say you experience."}, {"instruction": "So basically buck up and get out of the house more, right?", "input": "", "output": "In a nutshell."}, {"instruction": "I guess I'll give it a shot, but it's difficult.", "input": "", "output": "It will be at first, Tom, but you must help yourself take the first steps at socializing and starting new relationships. I know this will sound trite, but you must put the past behind you. As for our next session, I'll see you on Friday, April 25th at 4 pm."}, {"instruction": "All right. Thanks, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Take care."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Is everything okay?"}, {"instruction": "Why, do I look that bad?", "input": "", "output": "You called me \"Doctor\" for the first time."}, {"instruction": "I did?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, which is fine, but it threw me off guard since you've never called me that before. You do look particularly depressed today. What's going on?"}, {"instruction": "Do you ever feel like you have absolutely no control over your life?", "input": "", "output": "Well, there are brief times when I feel that way--most people experience periods of helplessness on occasion."}, {"instruction": "You have no idea what I mean. I don't ever recall feeling in control at any time in my life. I hate who I am. I hate my life and where it's going...or where it's not going, as the case may be. My job sucks, my social life sucks, my loans and bills suck, my haircut sucks, my vacuum cleaner doesn't suck--nothing goes right for me. I don't know why I'm alive. People protest against toxic waste and nuclear waste and how that affects our environment, but what about human waste, Charles? Shouldn't that be a crime, too? There are millions of us worthless people out there, living day to day, accomplishing nothing yet wasting precious resources by staying alive. People in Ethiopia are starving because American businesses use their land for cattle grazing to support our beef demand. That same land could have been used to grow crops to support the people in that country. I'm a beef eater, so that makes me partially responsible for those lives. I'm also wasting precious rental space that could have been used for someone who really needs shelter. I'm tearing up the ozone layer driving my car around aimlessly because I have nowhere in particular to go. There's no point to my being here. I'm simply a waste of human flesh.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you less important than anyone else?"}, {"instruction": "I have the luxury of certain items and opportunities others don't have. And I don't deserve those luxuries, Charles, because I don't take advantage of them. Why don't I? Because I don't know where to start. I don't know what route to take. I feel trapped in the life I lead, being tossed around in a swift current of failure that leads me nowhere. I wish I could be dead and start my life over. I'd like to be reborn into a wealthy, stable family where I can live a pampered life and have Mommy and Daddy pay my way through some expensive school and call my broker four times a day and scratch my nuts while I wait for my checks to roll in.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel that's possible? That if you were to die, you'd be able to start over in a new life?"}, {"instruction": "No, of course not. I don't believe in reincarnation any more than I believe in God or Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny. I know there's only blackness waiting for me when I die--that's what makes my situation that much more unbearable. I'm only alive because I'm not dead, you know? There's no reason, no purpose to my existence. Is that why so many people get involved with religion, Charles? Because the reality of our lives is so terrifying and pointless that we desperately cling to this notion that there's some elaborate, magical realm somewhere in the cosmos where we'd live throughout eternity?", "input": "", "output": "That's an argument that has plagued the minds of scholars for ages, Tom. I feel that you must trust your instinct and your heart when it comes to this area. If you find peace in your own belief, or your lack of one, then it is the right answer."}, {"instruction": "Then what you're saying is that I should turn to religion because right now I don't find peace in the fact that there is no God?", "input": "", "output": "No, that's not what I'm saying. Your feelings of inadequacy are not necessarily dependent on your religious beliefs. You feel a need to start over in order to correct what you believe are mistakes made during your life, but you can start making the changes now, Tom, to get the satisfaction out of life you need. You don't have to start over."}, {"instruction": "You ever watch Star Trek?", "input": "", "output": "From time to time."}, {"instruction": "I can't stand it. They always use this bullshit technical terminology to explain away just about every unique phenomenon that occurs in each episode. Whenever there's a crisis, there's this android on the show who'll tell the Captain: \"The hexadecimal Blaupunkt mounted horizontally will cause a static warp shell to beam lasers out of our assholes at approximately three million bits per second\" or some such gibberish. Anyway, I used to watch the show when I was younger and actually liked it. Recently, while I was flipping through the channels, I caught a recent episode. It was the one in which the Captain is killed and some character named \"Q\" gives him a chance to go back and change the course of his life, to prevent his death.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "The Captain accepted the offer, but when he made changes to points in his life he thought were mistakes, it reshaped his future to the point that he never became Captain--instead, he led his life doing menial, forgettable tasks as some junior-grade Lieutenant. So once the Captain realized what his changes had done, he told Q that he'd rather die as a Captain with all his mistakes intact than be the boring, drifting loser he was the second time around. When I saw this episode, it had a tremendous impact on me. I felt like I was that loser. I felt like I had made all the \"safe\" decisions and avoided taking risks in life. I had so many chances, Charles, to become more than what I am now. And I blew it.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you feel you've failed? You work for a reputable company, you have good technical skills and hundreds of employees depend on you, you graduated with a journalism degree--do you not feel these are tremendous accomplishments in and of themselves?"}, {"instruction": "No, because they don't make me happy.

I feel like abandoning everything.I want to have the freedom to get up from my cubicle at work, walk over to the manager's office, say \"fuck you\" and never step foot in the building again.I want the freedom from my school loans that keep me tied to this horrible job because otherwise I wouldn't be able to maintain the payments.I want to have the freedom to drive out to the beach and watch the sunset and fall asleep and wake up the next morning and not have to worry about whatever worthless fucking report my superiors want just so they have something to whack off to.I want my girlfriend back so I can hold her and make love to her and go away with her to places I'll probably never see in my lifetime.I want to write really torrid cheesy romance novels that thousands of women will swoon over and provide me the income to buy a boat so I can sail across the Pacific.I want to live in Australia, and I want to own a brewery so I don't have to keep stocking my fridge.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a nice life."}, {"instruction": "It's fucking Disneyland, is what it is. It will never happen. None of it. I'm stuck in the dreary life I lead. There's only one way out, in my mind. I just want to die, Charles. Is that so much to ask?", "input": "", "output": "Tom, we both know you don't want to die. You may feel like you have no control over your destiny, but that is because you've really made no effort to change or to do those things you wish you felt comfortable doing."}, {"instruction": "I thought you were on my side.", "input": "", "output": "I am, Tom, believe me. But no one can make those changes for you. You have to motivate yourself to go out and face the world and take charge of the path you lead. Avoiding people--shying away from social activities--will prevent you from achieving a large portion of the goals you've set for yourself."}, {"instruction": "I know. You're right. It's just so hard to do. I get so frightened in public, Charles. My mouth gets dry, my palms get sweaty, I feel sick to my stomach--I start to panic. All I want to do is get out of that environment and go home. I feel comfortable only when I'm alone, yet I hate being alone. Damn it, this is so hard. Why can't I just be like everyone else? Why do I have to be the type of person I am? I don't want to remain a hermit. I want to meet people and make friends and go places and do things. It's just not possible for me. I've been this way for too long to change, I think.", "input": "", "output": "That's not true. You're already changing. You've come to see me and you've identified points of your life that you feel have made you the person you are now. You did this almost completely on your own. It may not seem so, but that's tremendous progress, Tom. Your next step is to venture out more often and push yourself into those uncomfortable situations. That is the only way you're going to overcome your fear."}, {"instruction": "I wish I could just stick a tape in my VCR and watch some instructional film for a couple hours and be cured of all this.", "input": "", "output": "I know. It's going to be tough. I'm not going to fool you into believing otherwise. You seem to put yourself down before giving yourself a chance. You expect defeat. That attitude is your undoing.

See you at the concert tonight."}, {"instruction": "Hi Charles. Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "So, what did you think of the concert?"}, {"instruction": "It was all right. They were a lot more garish than I expected them to be.

She looked like some sort of hideous melting wax figure under all those stage lights.", "input": "", "output": "The makeup? Yes, I noticed that, too. What did you think of the music?"}, {"instruction": "It was quirky. When they started playing the Sesame Street tune, I had to laugh. Only in San Francisco, you know? I wasn't paying too much attention after the first couple tunes, mainly because my mind was reeling from being around so many people.", "input": "", "output": "I noticed after we greeted each other at the door that you sat down with a couple of people in a booth."}, {"instruction": "Yes. That was Rob and Jennifer--they work on the Help Desk with me.", "input": "", "output": "Wasn't Rob the one who broke up the fight at the Bull Market a couple of weeks ago?"}, {"instruction": "That's right. We all grabbed the booth in the corner and talked about work and how we're getting screwed-over again. Rob is up for a promotion as team leader, and when Doris Meckle on the Help Desk found out he was getting it, she threw a fit. Apparently she felt that position was hers. So Rob heard through the grapevine at work that Doris went to Human Resources to file a sexual discrimination charge against Dave Torriello, our manager. Can you believe that? First of all, no one on the Help Desk likes Doris. Second, she's a stuck-up ass-kisser who does nothing at her cubicle all day but call her boyfriend and shove matzos crackers down her throat. Third, she has the most obnoxious laugh of anyone I know. Imagine Fran Drescher from \"The Nanny\" trying to laugh with a Kazoo in her mouth while someone was choking her and you have an idea. Rob is furious, and he should be. He's far more experienced than Doris and a lot more likable. He found out from Dave today that he's going to have to re-evaluate the team leader position.", "input": "", "output": "So SII already has put pressure on your manager to lean towards Doris?"}, {"instruction": "It would seem so. Rob said that if she ended up getting the position over him, he was going to counter with an age discrimination charge against Dave.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds ugly."}, {"instruction": "Just another wonderful day at SII. Fucking job. It's not worth it. We're the hemorrhoidal sphincter valve of the company. Everyone--even our own employees--walk all over us. And we get paid nothing to show for our misery.

Did something happen?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so. The crowd, the noise...it just got unbearable for me after a while. I started feeling ill. Well, not exactly ill, just extremely uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "Can you describe the sensation a little more?"}, {"instruction": "Driving up there, I was okay. I was actually looking forward to it. But when I pulled into the parking lot, I began to feel queasy, like I was anticipating the doom of being out in public. It's the same feeling you get just before you reach the top of the first hill of a roller coaster. Your stomach is churning wildly in preparation for the impending physical forces your body's about to endure. I waited in the car for about 15 minutes, petrified. The longer I waited, the more people I saw in and around the club, which made me feel worse. I didn't want to get out, and I started and shut-off the ignition several times trying to decide whether or not to just leave and go home.", "input": "", "output": "What made you finally get out of the car?"}, {"instruction": "I saw Rob and Jennifer pull up. It was an enormous relief. Finally there was someone there I recognized. I was still very uptight and nervous, but at least I could be around them and blend in. We walked in together and Rob and Jennifer went off to grab a booth. That's when I saw you and we said hello.", "input": "", "output": "I see. How did you feel once you were seated with your friends?"}, {"instruction": "I felt a lot better. Some of the pressure was off. It was easy to tune out our surroundings and pretend that it was just the three of us, chatting away like we do at work. It was only later, towards the end of the concert, that I started to get nervous again.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure. During the concert, I knew that most of the people in there were focusing their attention on the band, so maybe that made me feel more at ease. But when it was close to the end of the performance, I slowly began to become ill again. I started to feel very claustrophobic--like the world was closing in. I tried to remain focused on Rob and Jennifer's conversation but the anxiety was overwhelming me. At one point, I distinctly remember imagining that the band had just finished, and then the crowd all at once turned around and looked at me. Everybody was completely quiet, staring me down, waiting for me to do something--maybe perform for them or say something eloquent. It was very frightening. That was all I could take. I shot up from the booth, said my goodbyes to Rob and Jennifer, and left as quickly as I could.", "input": "", "output": "How did Rob and Jennifer react to the way you left?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. They think I'm a little eccentric anyway, so I don't think it surprised them. I made up some excuse about having to get something to eat. I don't think they thought I was really hungry, but they didn't argue.", "input": "", "output": "Did the nervousness cease once you left?"}, {"instruction": "Almost immediately. I felt relieved and completely relaxed. Actually, I was sort of hungry, so to avoid being a liar, I went to this 24 hour place across the street and got some dinner. But you remember how I was telling you that strange things seem to happen the times I decide to go out?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Well, after I left the diner, I was crossing the street back to my car and I noticed a couple of police cars pulling up. Two officers walked through the back entrance to the club. Did something happen after I left?", "input": "", "output": "I heard there was a fight and one guy got arrested."}, {"instruction": "Strange. I think it was the same cops who maced the guy at the Bull Market. Anyway, it was just another instance in which I bailed out of a social situation in favor of my boring, lonesome existence back at my apartment. At least it wasn't as bad as the wedding.", "input": "", "output": "The wedding?"}, {"instruction": "Cherie Thorpe, a girl I used to work with and sit next to in the sales department, invited me to her wedding a couple of months ago. I accepted the invitation, bought her a wedding gift and planned on attending. I think I accepted the invitation more to force myself into overcoming my fear of people than to watch her exchange vows, although it would have been a nice gesture of friendship to show up.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't, I take it."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I was there. I just didn't go inside the church. Can you believe that? I get dressed up, spent a half hour trying to wrap her present, drove forty miles from town to get there, and only then do I decide to chicken out.", "input": "", "output": "Was it the same pattern as the concert, the same feeling of anxiety?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I was fine until I actually arrived at the church. The church parking lot was packed. Gobs of people I didn't know meandered about, chatting with each other, and then went inside. Suddenly, I was consumed by fear. I drove around the block about four times, trying to build up the strength to park and face these strangers, but I couldn't. Instead I drove a few miles down the road to where the reception was being held. There were a few people setting up decorations and caterers were preparing food when I walked in. I set my wedding gift on a table that already had some presents on it and I left.", "input": "", "output": "Did Cherie confront you later?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I knew she was disappointed with me. Rob was supposed to go with me that night, but he got sick. If he had come with me, I think I wouldn't have had a problem. Anyway, I used that as an excuse to Cherie, but I could tell that I had let her down. I let myself down! Why did I do that? What's so difficult about walking into a church and sitting down and watching a wedding? Why do I have these problems interacting with people? No, don't answer, Charles. I think I should just go now.", "input": "", "output": "I'd really like to discuss this with you further if you'll let me."}, {"instruction": "I really need to go home, Charles. I'm sorry.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right. Should I expect you next week at the same time?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Can I give you a call later on? I think I need to sort some of this out on my own for a little while.", "input": "", "output": "As you wish, Tom. But I think I can help with that. Take care, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Sorry, I guess I'm feeling a little lightheaded.", "input": "", "output": "Is it safe to assume you took the day off from work today?"}, {"instruction": "Damn right. I have several million fucking personal and vacation days accom...accume...accum-ul-ated and I don't use them for anything else anyway. I deserve to call in sick once in a while.", "input": "", "output": "How much alcohol have you had?"}, {"instruction": "Enough. I don't really count them anymore. That's something you do in college--that and stack the beer cans on top of one another to make an aluminum pyramid.", "input": "", "output": "Please don't tell me you drove here yourself."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I won't.", "input": "", "output": "Tom!"}, {"instruction": "Don't worry. I think I'm a better driver when I drink anyway. I stayed in the slow lane and even wore my seat belt this time, which I never do when I'm sober. I just wanted to make it to the session today and talk to someone other than myself. Besides, I called you earlier this week and told you I'd make it to this session, and I keep my promises.", "input": "", "output": "All right, well, now that you're here, is there anything in particular you want to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "Everything. Work, my drinking, my lack of a love-life, my lack of a life, period. I feel like I'm at my wit's end. Like there's no hope and everything's coming to a head. But all the shit that's tearing me apart inside isn't really what scares me the most.", "input": "", "output": "What does scare you?"}, {"instruction": "It's the fact that I actually enjoy it all, Charles. I think I'm attracted to negativity and pain and being depressed. Hell, maybe I'm addicted to it. Throughout my life, there's always been something traumatic to make me feel miserable, and I guess that over time I've gotten used to the misery. I mean, it's really the only thing I can truly count on to be there for me. Depression is like an old friend I've become close to and would feel empty without. I know it sounds horribly Pavlovian to you shrinks, but it's true. Someone starts crying and I suddenly get a hard-on. No, not really, Charles. But, do you know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do and considering your past, I don't find your reaction to be entirely out of the ordinary, especially since the negative events in your life have been pretty consistent for a number of years. It's good that you can at least still recognize negative emotion for what it is. We need to work on bringing some positive forces into your life."}, {"instruction": "\"If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.\"", "input": "", "output": "I beg your pardon?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing. Never mind.", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "I remember when Sharon broke up with me, how devastated I felt, how hopeless and futile my life and my future seemed to be. It was a deep, penetrating pain, Charles, unlike any kind of emotional distress I had ever experienced before. I was so very much in love with her. For once in my life, I could relate to that word and what it meant to care for someone and to want that person to remain in my life. Dad's death and my stepfather's abuse struck me in different places and with a kind of pain that was more dull and lingered over the course of a number of years, but when I lost Sharon, it hurt intensely and immediately. That whole night I spent sobbing uncontrollably. And yet at the same time, while all these horrifying sensations were knocking the wind out of me, I felt a distinct sense of rejoicing. When I left Sharon's campus that day, I recall looking forward to going home and listening to really depressing music and downing some beers for the first time in over a year. It was like, \"Hooray! The old Tom is back! Hell has returned!\" At times I wonder if my persistence in trying to get back together with her wasn't something I intentionally did to make myself feel worse, as if I allowed her continuous rejection to sting me as long as was possible. I was a junkie of pain, greedily and hungrily trying to squeeze every last drop of heartache I could out of the situation. It hurt greatly but it was also a very potent, very invigorating feeling, Charles. It made me feel more alive than when I was actually going out with the bitch. Does any of this make sense?", "input": "", "output": "Most of it, yes. This sensation you hunger for, is it what drives you to drink? Is this why you're inebriated now?"}, {"instruction": "All I know is that I have good days and bad days. Sometimes I go a whole week or two without drinking, then suddenly I feel overcome with depression and turn to the brew, not to make me feel better, but to accentuate the experience. When I'm on a binge, Charles, I try to determine in my head how fast I can drink to make me effectively suicidal by midnight. God, this sounds so strange to me when I'm describing it out loud.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "It's just that I've never really admitted that to myself. I've never acknowledged that I aim to perpetuate and enhance my own sorrow. Maybe that's one of the reasons why I prefer to stay home by myself and drink instead of going out with friends or socializing. I like the pain.", "input": "", "output": "On the other hand, when you do go out with friends, you still tend to drink heavily. Is this also because you want to enhance your negative sensations?"}, {"instruction": "The people I hang out with tend to have their own set of personal problems, which means they all wallow in alcohol and complain and talk about what they should be doing in life and aren't. No one on the Help Desk wants to be on the Help Desk, Charles. We all ended up there because things basically didn't pan out for us in the technical world the way we had hoped. But, as Dave Torriello is fond of saying, \"you are exactly where you're supposed to be based on the decisions you've made in life.\"", "input": "", "output": "Do you believe that?"}, {"instruction": "Fuck no. Do I think people who live in the projects are there because they chose to be there? Or children whose parents molest them were put in that situation because they chose to have it happen to them? Of course not. It's just that all those people I work and go out with are misfits like me. It's a welcome environment. I don't feel out of place when we all hang out together. So I don't mind drinking with them. But these friends are also more gregarious than I am, which means they typically like to do things when we go out that I don't feel comfortable doing. They like parties, meeting people, dancing--that sort of thing. I can't deal with any of those things. So I get very uptight when they urge me to leave the bar and join them for more group-related activities. The times I'm thrust into those situations, I usually drink to feel more comfortable. So I guess when I'm out in public, I'm drinking for two reasons: to feel like shit but also to feel more at ease.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Contradictory, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but from what you've said, we can determine a pattern of drinking influenced primarily by both your past experiences and outside social pressures. You've become accustomed to the emotional pain because you've encountered some traumatizing events in your life over a long period of time. Naturally, any other sensations--positive or otherwise--would be foreign to you. As for your drinking in response to uncomfortable social situations, I feel you may be unwittingly treating yourself for your affliction the only way you know how.  We call it self-medicating."}, {"instruction": "On the contrary, I'm quite aware that beer's effects will make me feel more at ease. And at the same time I know it will also make me feel horrible about myself, which I'm pretty sure I'm attracted to. What I don't understand is, if being uncomfortable in a public place makes me feel horrible, why do I try to cure myself with beer? If I love the pain so much, why don't I take on the experience sober?", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps it's more about control, Tom. Your father's death, your stepfather's abuse, the dissolution of your relationship with Sharon--these were events you could not control. But now, by remaining at home in a controlled environment and drinking large quantities of alcohol, you have the power over your emotions. You can dictate when you can and cannot feel miserable. You're doing it on your own terms."}, {"instruction": "And by going out in public, being with friends and around a bunch of people I don't know, I've lost that power, that control?", "input": "", "output": "Precisely."}, {"instruction": "It's all terribly confusing to me. All I know is, I like beer. It makes me feel the way I want to feel sometimes, and no one can take that away from me, you know?", "input": "", "output": "No one can take it away from you, but if you're not careful, the alcohol can very quickly assume control over you, Tom."}, {"instruction": "You think that's what's happening? That I've lost control over my drinking?", "input": "", "output": "Have you?"}, {"instruction": "No! Honest, Charles, I can stop! I know that sounds like denial to you, but I really can. I don't need booze. I don't wake up every morning shaking violently because I haven't had a drink in eight hours. There are just times when I want to feel a certain way and beer makes me feel pretty close to how I want to feel.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to experience positive feelings in your life, or are you content with the negativity?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if I could recognize a positive feeling. It's been a while since I've felt happy. Happiness is like a hollow word in the dictionary to me right now. But I do want to change. I don't want to be stuck at home all the time. I want to feel in control when I'm out there, on the other side of my apartment door. I just don't know how to get there.", "input": "", "output": "I think that if you continue to thrust yourself into social settings, that's a good start. I would also like to again bring up the possibility that certain medications might have a positive effect on you."}, {"instruction": "I was skeptical when you first brought up the subject, but I'll have to admit I'm interested.", "input": "", "output": "I'm pleased to hear that, Tom. I'd like to start you on a type of drug called Chlordiazepoxide.  It's in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines and I think it may help you feel more at ease in social environments, among other things. It would mean, however, sacrificing the alcohol."}, {"instruction": "Completely?", "input": "", "output": "Ideally, yes, I'd like for you to stay off it; an occasional beer--say one or two a week--wouldn't be harmful, but when I say one or two, I mean exactly that.  Here's your prescription."}, {"instruction": "Understood.  Wait a second, this says Librium.", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  That's the trade name."}, {"instruction": "Isn't Librium what schizophrenics take?", "input": "", "output": "I think you mean Lithium."}, {"instruction": "Oh, but isn't this a tranquilizer?", "input": "", "output": "It's more of an anti-anxiety agent.  Here.  I've got a sheet which will give you a lot more information about this drug.  I really think that you'll see a very rapid change for the better.  And I'd also like for you to continue our little project of visiting public places. The more often you elect to participate, the more comfortable you'll get. Libraries, shopping malls, crowded restaurants, a Giants game--all of these settings would be suitable for the exercise."}, {"instruction": "There's a book store I've been to before that has a coffee shop inside. It's usually packed full of artsy-fartsy types and I've usually felt those pangs of nervousness when I go there, which isn't often. Maybe I could try actually sitting down to a cup of tea and a book there from time to time.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds appropriate. Pay close attention to the dosage, and I'll see you in one week."}, {"instruction": "All right, thanks, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Where do you think you're going?"}, {"instruction": "Aren't we through?", "input": "", "output": "We are, but you're not driving home. I'm calling you a cab."}, {"instruction": "Come on, Charles, I...", "input": "", "output": "I insist, Tom."}, {"instruction": "All right. No sense in arguing. I'll be in the waiting room.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Tom. He should be here in about fifteen minutes."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Tom. How have you been these past two weeks?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Sorry I had to suddenly cancel last week but I had a surprise visitor show up.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, my brother Alex flew out here last Friday and stayed with me for a week. It was completely unexpected. As soon as I found out he was here in San Francisco, I knew there was trouble. He's been having some problems lately with his live-in girlfriend. They've been together for four years but the last six months have been fairly tumultuous. I'm just glad their son is still too young to understand what's going on.", "input": "", "output": "How old is their son?"}, {"instruction": "He'll be two in July. His name is Jordan. Alex is a big Chicago Bulls fan, you see.", "input": "", "output": "Got it."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, Alex and Martha graduated from Penn State a year ago. They stayed in Swiftwater for about a month before Alex found work as a graphic designer for a firm in Pittsburgh. The three of them packed up and moved out there, and Martha took a job waitressing until she eventually got hired at an advertising agency. After their move, things began to steadily go downhill. Of course, I've only heard one side of the story, but it sounds pretty bleak for them, which sucks. I've always hoped that Alex would end up being successful and happy so at least one of us wasn't a disappointment to Mom.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure your mother doesn't see either of you as disappointments."}, {"instruction": "I wish I could be so sure. I've always been sort of the black sheep. What the hell--black is my favorite color, anyway. But Alex, well, he always seemed to have a more level head. Things seem to bounce off him a lot easier than they do me. He always did better in school, was far more outgoing and had a lot of friends. He's pretty much the exact opposite of me. It's strange that I see him that way, because I've noticed we seem to think alike on a lot of things. We have a tendency to finish each other's sentences and, over the phone, my Mom can't even tell us apart because our voices are so similar. He's led a decent life so far. It has really shocked me that he's having problems now after seemingly doing everything right for so long.", "input": "", "output": "What sort of problems do you mean, if I may ask?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's a little embarrassing to talk about, even for me. Alex has always been overly suspicious of Martha, in my opinion. Her job requires her to work late on projects and I guess staying home with a kid every night, waiting for your girlfriend to come home, gets the imagination going. He was sure she was cheating on him. He told me once it was only a matter of time before he had proof, but I told him he was being ridiculous and should focus on getting his family settled in Pittsburgh. It bothered me that my brother was beginning to look more at the pessimistic side of things. I mean, that was my territory to cover, not his. He has everything I wish I could have. What gives him the right to destroy it all with accusations he can't prove? It's ridiculous and paranoid.", "input": "", "output": "What prompted him to fly out to visit you? Did he get the proof he had sought after?"}, {"instruction": "In his eyes, yes. I met Alex at the airport, and the first thing he did was pull me close and whisper in my ear, \"The bitch gave me herpes.\" He told me that Martha tried to give him some explanation her doctor had presented to her that she could have given him a form of the herpes virus from a cold sore in her mouth while she was performing oral sex on him. Alex wouldn't accept this possibility. He had the proof he needed that she was unfaithful. He said he grabbed a suitcase, packed some clothes and a toothbrush and bought a plane ticket here. In the car on the way to my apartment he told me that he was going to leave Martha.", "input": "", "output": "You said he stayed a week. Did he manage to work things out?"}, {"instruction": "I hope so. Every night he was here was spent on the phone with Martha. I overheard bits and pieces of their conversation, partly because he was screaming and it was unavoidable, but I think he realizes he needs her and he's been unreasonable. They've got a kid to worry about and I don't think they're ready to bail out on each other. When I dropped him off at the airport this morning, he seemed a lot more optimistic. I think he just needed some time away from Martha to sort his feelings out. It was a good week for him.", "input": "", "output": "A diversion from the standard routine is usually healthy."}, {"instruction": "I tried to get his mind off home as much as I could. Over the weekend, I took him to the usual tourist spots: we drove across the Golden Gate, walked around downtown and rode on a cable car. It was clear and warm Wednesday so Alex and I went to the Giants game. Of course with our luck we had to see the one game in the series they lose to the Colorado Rockies. I don't think I've ever been to a baseball game where the home team won. I must be jinxed.", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't let any of the ballplayers catch wind of that. They tend to be very superstitious. You might not get to come back. Did Barry Bonds get any hits?"}, {"instruction": "Nope. Walked once, but that was it. The Rockies won 10-7. It was still a good game, and I was itching for a beer, but you'll be happy to know my brother and I sat in the Pavilion. They don't serve alcohol in that section.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "My brother kept calling the stadium Candlestick Park but I had to keep reminding him that it was now 3COM Park. Everything has to be corporate these days. 3COM Park, Pacific Bell Park, Cinergy Field, Turner Field--you can't go anywhere without seeing some corporate label attached to something.", "input": "", "output": "That's true. How comfortable were you this week, taking your brother out to all these public places?"}, {"instruction": "I felt better than I usually do. I wasn't as self-conscious. I don't know if it's due to the Librium you prescribed me or just the fact that it was my brother or maybe a combination of the two. I definitely felt more at ease.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "Maybe a little too much at ease sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, there were some occasions while Alex and I were out that I reacted to situations differently. Instead of being edgy and nervous out in public, I sometimes felt...drunk. My inhibitions seemed to drop completely a few times and just about anything or anyone was fair game for my amusement.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "Well, my brother is a vegetarian, so I took him to a street cafe I had heard about, one that serves primarily meatless entrees. The setting didn't stop me from ordering one of the few red meat options on the menu: a double cheeseburger with mushroom sauce and onions. My brother didn't mind but it was obvious from the stares I got that everyone else wanted to throw me off in a corner somewhere with the smokers and lepers of the world. Hypocrites. I mean, these people complain that beef production contributes to the world's deforestation yet they think it's okay to waste reams of paper on their stupid art projects or that they can wear those stylish leather jackets. Anyway, instead of feeling embarrassed about the situation, I took advantage of the opportunity to offend them more. A couple of college girls who were seated near us and who were especially bold with their glares and finger pointing became my target of entertainment.", "input": "", "output": "Uh oh."}, {"instruction": "When the waiter arrived with my burger, I picked it up, opened the top bun and moved it up and down as if the burger were talking to me. \"Eat me, Tom, eat my big, beefy, greasy body!\" it said loudly to me in a voice not unlike Grover from Sesame Street. The girls looked disgusted. Alex couldn't stop laughing. Then I bit an unusually large bite out of the burger and began making chomping noises and moaning in ecstasy. \"Oh, you're such a good burger, oh what a good burger, oh my GOD!\" There was sauce dripping down my chin but I didn't wipe it off so as to add to the effect. By this time the two girls were quickly grabbing their things and trying to get the waiter's attention so they could pay and get the hell out of there. It was kind of a crude, juvenile thing to do but it was more of an experiment for me than anything else. I wanted to see how far I'd go. I would never have had the balls to do that before, not in public. The embarrassment I would usually feel simply wasn't there. Amazing what a little pill can do, assuming that's what caused me to put on the performance.", "input": "", "output": "How did this performance make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I felt like everyone's eyes were centered on me, much like they were when I went to the Dozin Pozers concert, but this time it was almost as if I welcomed the attention. The more people who noticed my antics, the more animated I got.", "input": "", "output": "Like you would act if you were drunk."}, {"instruction": "Right. To be honest, I don't think I would have done it if my brother hadn't been there, so that's why I think it wasn't all the work of the medication. It seems like I can't have a happy medium; I'm either petrified of socializing and being in public or I have to be on a virtual stage, putting on some kind of show with the whole world as my audience.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Why do you think that is?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure. An uncle of mine told me once that he thought I remained quiet and anti-social to draw attention to myself, not avoid it. I had never really thought of it in quite that way, but maybe he's right. But it still doesn't explain why I would feel anxious in public. Maybe it's because I feel obligated to put on a show in those situations, I don't know. Maybe now that I have Librium in my blood I can follow through with the performance.", "input": "", "output": "Let's give the medication a little more time before we start drawing conclusions. Our time is about up. Can I expect to see you next Friday?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'll be here. Oh, and I wanted to let you know that I'm leaving for vacation in early June and won't return until about June 10th, so I'll be missing the June 6 session.", "input": "", "output": "Vacation, eh? Anywhere special?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't really made any firm plans. Just needed some time off work.", "input": "", "output": "You're not having any more problems there are you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes and no, but nothing I can't handle.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Take care, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "A little late, are we?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, sorry about that. And thanks for making the session on Monday instead of Friday. I've just spent some extra time at work getting everything squared away so I don't have as many surprises when I return from vacation.", "input": "", "output": "Ah, yes. Tell me a little more about that. Do you have any special plans?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it was very difficult to do at the last minute but I was able to arrange a flight out to Scranton. From there I'll rent a car and head to Swiftwater and visit my Mom for a while. There's a lake near there and I thought after my visit I'd get a cabin for a couple days away from the city. I don't know exactly what I'll be doing in a cabin all by myself, but I guess I don't really have much choice in the matter.", "input": "", "output": "And why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Because I attract about as many women as a can of bug repellent attracts mosquitoes.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you really give women a chance, do you?"}, {"instruction": "I guess not, but I can't help it. I've never been able to approach women, unless I'm drunk, in which case I end up making even more of a fool of myself. I know I'm not butt-ugly yet I also know that I lack the allure that other, more outgoing and confident guys enjoy. I think my low self-esteem is far too evident to women and I know it's such a turn-off. I mean, I definitely don't get aroused by those quiet, mousy girls who cover their mouths when they laugh and do everything to avoid attention, so why should I expect any woman with half a brain to go after someone like me?", "input": "", "output": "What about your ex-girlfriend Sharon? She evidently saw something in you if you sustained a relationship for over a year."}, {"instruction": "Totally different circumstances. I never approached Sharon. I was set up with her on a blind date. I didn't really have to do anything. Plus, Sharon's self-esteem hadn't been all that great at the time we met. She had just broken off with her last boyfriend who got her pregnant, then she got an abortion. She was feeling pretty low--I think she would have gone out with anyone then. Over time, my love for her boosted her own self-esteem to the point that eventually she outgrew me and realized that she could do a whole lot better. She left me more for that reason than anything else. It was just a coincidence that college happened to be starting up at the time.", "input": "", "output": "You're being too harsh on yourself, Tom. It may well have been true that the two of you were beginning to drift apart, but based on what you've told me, I'm sure the transition to college lent a hand in ending the relationship."}, {"instruction": "Maybe. All I know is that I'll never get that lucky again. And it was luck, make no mistake about it. How many blind dates have you heard about that end up turning into a relationship that lasts a year and a half? Not too many. It's almost as if fate stepped in and allowed me just one relationship, so that I could experience sex and have an idea of what being in love felt like. Then fate took it all away from me. It dangled happiness in my face teasingly and when I reached out to grab it, fate yanked it away. It's not fair. I'm a decent guy. I'm not overweight, I don't smell bad, I read sentences from left to right, yet I see tons of complete jerks all around me with women who fawn over them while I'm stuck at home on Friday nights beating off to a Baywatch rerun.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think your difficulty has as much to do with your personality as it does the circumstances you allow yourself to participate in. You're not putting yourself out on the market, so to speak. You have to make yourself known before women will notice you.  It's like the old joke about the religious man who kept praying to God to let him win the lottery.  But week after week went by, and nothing.  Finally, when the old man was losing his religious faith, a booming voice rang out from the heavens--\"Give me a break.  At least go and buy a ticket.\""}, {"instruction": "Yeah, great. But even if I do go out, as a male I'm expected to make the first move. That's Society's little damnation for all men like me. I could never be that guy who walks up to a girl at a bar and buys her a drink and starts up some ridiculous conversation about who the hell knows what. I hate men like that, anyway. They all seem like smug, conceited assholes. I have this theory that you have to be a complete jerk if you expect to attract women. Women don't like nice guys. They want someone who will ignore them or cheat on them or fight with them or smack them around. That all equates to mystery and adventure. I've met so many women at work or at college who have come to me when their boyfriends treat them like shit. Yet they always end up going back to them. They never break up. It boggles my fucking mind.", "input": "", "output": "Let's go back to what you just said. Women come to you to talk about their boyfriends?"}, {"instruction": "It's a tremendous curse of mine. Because I'm so quiet and non-threatening, women seem to think I'm a great person to talk to. If I had a dime for every woman who said I was a good listener, I'd have enough money to hire a high-priced hooker for a week. And lately that doesn't seem like it'd be too bad an investment. Women seem compelled to tell me all about their fucking problems and then I end up giving them advice that they never really heed anyway. Occasionally I find myself getting emotionally involved with these women, which makes it even worse for me because I know I'll never be able to have a relationship with any of them. And it's frustrating. I'm always on the outside looking in. I can see but I can't touch. Why can't I be one of those boyfriends that they come to me complaining about, anyway?", "input": "", "output": "You don't have to change who you are to be involved with someone."}, {"instruction": "Like hell. If that were true, there'd be no such thing as bars. You go into any bar and all you see is a sea of desperate guys like me spending money they don't have on booze and hoping they'll score. Society has done this to men, Charles. If you're not the type of person that fits the mold you see on those Calvin Klein billboards, you might as well hang it up. Women, on the other hand, have all the power in the world when it comes to relationships. Any relatively attractive woman can get a man at the snap of her fingers.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that's true."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, right. If a woman stepped into a crowded bar, stood on top of a table and announced \"I want to have sex tonight, who will accommodate me?\" a fucking line of guys would form, all of them jumping up and down with their hands raised, screaming \"Me! Me! Pick me!\" If a guy did the same thing he'd be greeted with laughter and a few shouts of \"Yeah, buddy, join the crowd!\"", "input": "", "output": "Well, a bar is about the worst location you could find if you were looking for someone to have a meaningful relationship with."}, {"instruction": "So where do you suggest, Charles? A library because all the women there are intelligent? A gym because all the women there are fit, if not dripping with sweat? A mall because age of consent laws really aren't well enforced, anyway? There aren't a whole lot of options out there, Charles. It must have been immeasurably easier in the prehistoric times when all you had to do was club a woman over the head, drag her to your cave and convince her to stay by showing her what a big dick you have. The fact is, I really want to be with someone, Charles. It's driving me crazy. I don't want to be alone and that's really the reason why I chose to see you. I don't simply want to overcome this fear I have of going out, I want to be strong enough to initiate a conversation with a total stranger and get to know her and ask her out and do all the things that nature intended for males to be able to do. You would think the natural instinct to be with the opposite sex would be enough to get me out of the apartment, but it isn't. Even with the drug you've prescribed me, I haven't found the strength to do anything more than simply be in a public place.", "input": "", "output": "But you have managed to go out more often than what is usual for you?"}, {"instruction": "I went to the bookstore I mentioned a few sessions back, the one with the coffee shop in the store's center. A lot of women go there--mostly college age, many of them very attractive. I bought a cookbook I'd been planning on getting--naturally, living by myself leaves me little choice but to fix my own dinner--bought a cup of almond-amaretto cappuccino and sat myself down. I was there for maybe ten minutes when a couple girls walked by me on their way to the counter. I glanced back at them and the redhead immediately caught my eye. She was looking over at me and smiling while her friend was placing their order. I started to break out in a cold sweat, more out of giddiness than fear. I tried to maintain my composure and went back to reading my book, when the two girls returned to sit a few tables away from me. As they passed, the redhead said, \"Oh, so you fancy yourself a chef, do you?\"", "input": "", "output": "What did you say?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing.", "input": "", "output": "Nothing?"}, {"instruction": "I completely choked on whatever brilliant words I imagined would come from my mouth. In the end, I simply smirked at her stupidly and out of embarrassment turned back to my book. She sat down with her friend and that was it.", "input": "", "output": "What a shame."}, {"instruction": "And I know I blew it. I have had so many shots like that over the years, Charles, believe me, but I squander them every single time. I never dated in high school. Girls resorted to asking me out because I'd never initiate anything. But even when they'd ask me, I'd turn them down. I was too afraid, I guess. Or maybe I didn't feel like I deserved to be with someone at the time. I don't know. All I know is that it took beer to finally get me to open up in any form.", "input": "", "output": "How have you been with the alcohol, lately?"}, {"instruction": "Drinking about as much as I normally do. About one or two a night and six or seven on Fridays and Saturdays", "input": "", "output": "That's not good, Tom. Especially with Librium. The combination is really not recommended. I must emphasize the danger of combining these two drugs."}, {"instruction": "I know it's potentially fatal.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm not sure about fatal, but certainly the combination is not conducive to your well-being.  Promise me you'll cut back on the alcohol, Tom. In fact, you should stop completely. Our time is about up.

Goodbye, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Take care."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "How was your vacation in Pennsylvania?"}, {"instruction": "Uneventful and wet. It either rained or threatened to rain most of the time there.", "input": "", "output": "How long did you stay?"}, {"instruction": "I left Tuesday morning, the day after our last session, and arrived back in San Francisco this morning. I decided to take my full two weeks off. I return to the regular grind at SII Monday.", "input": "", "output": "You went camping or something, right?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess you could call it that, but I cheated. I rented a cabin that comes complete with a kitchen and a shower and a TV. It was in the woods near a lake but I definitely wasn't \"roughing it.\" I did some fishing, grilled some steaks and watched it rain. I got fairly bored after the third day but at least I wasn't staying at my Mom's.", "input": "", "output": "Did you visit your mother at all?"}, {"instruction": "She picked me up from the airport. As usual, we managed to talk civilly for about ten minutes and then we ended up in an argument over something ridiculous. This time it was over religion.", "input": "", "output": "How did you get on that topic?"}, {"instruction": "Mom's boyfriend, Jeff, has a grandson who's two years old. Basically, this means Mom considers the kid her grandchild, too. Mom and Jeff are both into Christianity now and shower the grandson with little religious trinkets and Christian storybooks and crap like that. She said she sent similar gifts that week to Jordan, my brother's son, and Alex immediately sent them back. This, of course, greatly upset Mom, even though she knows that neither Alex nor I believe in a god. Alex and Martha had already told Mom not to try to influence their child with religious articles but Mom presses on anyway, hoping that eventually we'll \"see the light and be saved.\" Such bullshit. That's what I said in the car. \"Religion is bullshit.\" The argument soon followed.", "input": "", "output": "Were you arguing more over the idea of religion or over the fact that your mother persists in trying to impose her religious views on Jordan?"}, {"instruction": "We fought about religion in general. Alex and I stopped believing in God at about the same time--while we were in high school. From a practical standpoint, the existence of some divine force controlling the cosmos and granting miracles seemed very silly to us. Mom has known that we don't support her beliefs, and it's been very difficult for her. When we tell her we don't believe in God, she starts crying and making us feel guilty. \"I want us to all be together in a happy place when we die and when you talk like that you're preventing your salvation, \" she'll sob. Give me a break! So here we are, in the car, and I basically scold Mom for sending religious gifts to Jordan when she knows Martha and Alex are Atheists. She looked over at me in shock, like it was the first time she had heard that. Then she went on about how we're too young to fully understand the concept of creation, blah, blah, blah. Yet because she lives with her boyfriend and is assumably having sex, she's living in sin herself.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Alex made that point to her. Religion breeds hypocrisy. There have been more wars waged and lives lost in the name of some God than anything else, yet these gods supposedly do not permit the taking of a life. You don't need to have religion to have morals, but people seem to think that without religion there'd be chaos. I say religion causes chaos. Anyway, it was a long ride to Mom's house Tuesday.", "input": "", "output": "I'm beginning to see why you chose to rent the cabin."}, {"instruction": "It was worth the money in that sense.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else happen during your vacation?"}, {"instruction": "Not really, except I saw Sharon.", "input": "", "output": "I'd say that's pretty significant, wouldn't you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I never expected it to happen.", "input": "", "output": "Did you approach her?"}, {"instruction": "No, she actually walked up to me. I was shocked. I thought for sure she hated me and wouldn't want to set foot near me again. I had rented a car early Wednesday morning and drove to the grocery store to get food for the cabin, and there she was.", "input": "", "output": "How did the conversation go?"}, {"instruction": "It was very strained at first. She had changed a lot in two years. Her hair was very short and it appeared more blonde than I had remembered. I guess she bleached it out. She also seemed to have gained some muscle and she seemed very toned. When I first saw her at the other end of the isle, she was looking at me, and was basically waiting for me to react. I think that if I hadn't smiled or if I had looked away, she would never have approached me. She smiled back slowly and then walked up to me. I asked her how she was doing, and she said she was fine and that she was still going to school. She was surprised when I told her I had moved out to San Francisco. I had figured she would somehow find out about it but I guess I was wrong. She congratulated me, but seemed a little down, almost disappointed. It was then that I told her how sorry I was about sending her the scathing letters, that I had felt frustrated and hurt at the time and did it without really thinking. She seemed to blow it off like it no longer bothered her. It was at about that time that I noticed the engagement ring.", "input": "", "output": "That would certainly explain why she'd be so quick to forgive you now."}, {"instruction": "Yup. Sharon saw me looking at the ring and told me a little about her fianc\u00e9. They met in Poli-Sci class and have been dating for two years. She opened up her purse and pulled out a picture of him, and the guy looked a lot like me. He had short brown hair and was slightly more muscular in build. They're getting married in three months. I congratulated her, wished her the best, and then we hugged. I don't know how long we held each other, but in those moments all the feelings I had for her rushed forth at once. I realized that this was going to be the last time I would ever hold her and it ended up being in the canned foods aisle. We said our goodbyes and I checked out my items. As soon as I stepped into my car and shut the door, I started crying like a baby.", "input": "", "output": "I see tears welling up now."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, so they are. Funny how life goes. Sharon loved me once. I could have been that guy she's marrying if I had just been a few years younger. Even though I'm living in San Francisco, I still felt that somehow I'd end up back with Sharon. Now she's really gone forever.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Sharon is truly the woman with whom you'd want to spend the rest of your life? From what I've heard so far about her, you had very little in common."}, {"instruction": "She was my first and only love, Charles. No other woman has ever been in love with me. I turn 26 in August. Under the circumstances, I don't think I have many options. In a few years I'll be 30 and if I haven't found someone by then I might as well hang it up.", "input": "", "output": "I have to tell you that's absurd.  I'm 37, and I'm not ready to hang it up.  As we've discussed before, you're not giving yourself opportunities to meet people, Tom. Staying at home and keeping yourself secluded from the outside world is not exactly conducive to finding romance."}, {"instruction": "Well, I went to that coffee shop and bombed when the redhead tried to flirt with me.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't exactly bomb, you simply chose not to talk. That's what you need to change. You're self conscious.  You worry about how someone is going to perceive you when you speak and that worry is inhibiting your ability to talk to people."}, {"instruction": "I just don't want to make a fool out of myself, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Would you agree that the girl at the coffee shop probably didn't feel too highly of you after you said nothing and turned away?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she probably did.", "input": "", "output": "And would you also agree that if you had answered her when she spoke to you, the chances of getting to know her would have been much greater than how you chose to handle the encounter?"}, {"instruction": "Probably. But it's so hard to speak to someone like that. I don't know how to articulate to you the fear that I feel when I'm in those situations. My body wants to either fight or flee, and I always choose to flee.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure she felt uneasy approaching you, too. But she was able to take the first step. If you simply tried to take the first step, Tom, you might find the results in your favor. At least give it some thought."}, {"instruction": "I'll try.", "input": "", "output": "All right. And we can work on making you more comfortable talking to people--trying to reduce that feeling of self-consciousness.  How would you like to schedule the next session? Same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "That's fine.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you then."}, {"instruction": "See you later.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Charles!", "input": "", "output": "Why hello, Tom. I must say you seem in high spirits."}, {"instruction": "Oh, you might say so. It probably has something to do with the Mountain Dews I've been sucking down all day.", "input": "", "output": "No, there's something else different about you. Take a seat."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "If I didn't know better, I'd say you've met someone."}, {"instruction": "Come on, Charles, that's such a clich\u00e9. Getting laid doesn't change the world that dramatically.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what happened to you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, no, not really, but it seems like if someone's in a good mood it always has to be attributed to a recent sexual experience. That gives women way too much credit--much more than they deserve.", "input": "", "output": "So this recent mood swing of yours has nothing to do with sex or women?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't say that. Damn it, Charles, do you have to analyze everything? I'm in a good mood, for Christ's sake. Is that so bad?", "input": "", "output": "No, it's not bad at all. It's just that I don't buy that it's completely unmotivated."}, {"instruction": "While you're sitting there dissecting me, could you maybe find the time to go to hell?", "input": "", "output": "Tom, you have to understand..."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry. That was out of line. It's just that every time I walk in here and talk to you, I feel like either you're completely not listening or you're staring so intently at me that you make me feel guilty, like you think I'm holding something back from you and should be ashamed for not sharing it. I feel compelled to talk about things I never intended to bring up.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't realize I made you so uncomfortable."}, {"instruction": "You don't...well, not really. I talk to myself a lot, Charles, living alone. Coming here...speaking to you is a lot like talking to myself. I don't mean any offense by that. It's just that sometimes I need to explode and vent to a living, breathing person once in a while and never get the opportunity. So I pay you to listen to me regurgitate my thoughts. Before I started seeing you, I used to stare in the mirror a lot and talk out loud about how I feel and what I want to do in life and why it's not happening.", "input": "", "output": "Was there ever a response?"}, {"instruction": "No! The mirror never talked back. I'm not that far gone yet. When I had been hired to my first full-time job a few years ago and had a steady relationship with someone, things seemed to be falling into place. It was easy to look ahead to happier times. Then it all ended abruptly just when I thought life was starting to make sense and coming into focus. Sharon was a big part of my happiness and, when I lost her, everything else followed. Since then, I've lived a pretty hollow existence. Many times I find myself wondering what point there is to anything. You're born, you grow old, and then you die. What does this accomplish? Why exist at all? So we can watch MTV all day?", "input": "", "output": "You've placed a lot of emphasis on Sharon in relationship to your life and your perspective of it. For the little time you two had together, your feelings seem disproportionate."}, {"instruction": "Maybe what you said earlier was right. Maybe getting laid does make that much of a difference to us guys.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't say that. I simply guessed that you had met someone."}, {"instruction": "Whatever. You implied it. Let me put it this way: Sharon loved me. That made me mean something. It gave me purpose and, for the first time, a sense of clarity. She took all that with her when we broke up.", "input": "", "output": "She didn't take anything from you. Your perceptions of the situation were all that changed. It was your inability at the time to cope with the emotions that inevitably followed your breakup that made the experience so devastating to you. From what you've told me, you weren't experienced with the nuances of relationships and certainly you found it difficult dealing with the repercussions of the split. I think during that period of your life, you had an unusually high sense of co-dependency."}, {"instruction": "You're saying I kissed her ass.", "input": "", "output": "Not exactly, but it certainly seems like she played more of a dominating role than you did. You were only happy when she was near, which gave her an enormous amount of control. The key to this, though, is your lack of experience. As you become more involved socially, you will begin to see in retrospect the relative insignificance of your time with Sharon."}, {"instruction": "Well, I think my involvement with other people might be hindered by Sharon once again.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by that? I thought she was engaged to be married."}, {"instruction": "She is. Sharon called and left a message on my answering machine four days ago.", "input": "", "output": "How did she find your number? What did she want?"}, {"instruction": "She simply called my Mom and asked for it. Mom thought I would have wanted her to have it, so she readily gave it to her. I got home from work Monday night around seven, and there was the message light, blinking at me. When I pressed the button and heard her voice, it triggered something. I felt this pleasant tingling sensation in the back of my neck and I could feel the blood rush to my skull. It was like my dream had come true. Sharon wanted to talk to me! Her message was pretty brief: she asked me how I was, left me her e-mail address at school and her phone number. It was amazing. This same girl two years ago had removed her phone number from the school directory to keep me from calling and had done everything to make sure I stayed out of her life, and then all of sudden she's giving me everything but her bra size, which I know already.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I like what you're telling me."}, {"instruction": "Then you definitely won't dig what happened next. I sent an e-mail to Sharon later that night since Pennsylvania's time zone is three hours ahead of ours and it was getting too late to call. She replied the next afternoon and asked me to call. That night I called her and we spoke for at least two hours. We re-lived the whole year and a half we had together, including the break-up. It was like our entire relationship was encapsulated into that one conversation. We laughed, we argued, we cried...we had sex.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "This is probably not a good thing to talk about.", "input": "", "output": "I'm assuming you're not speaking figuratively?"}, {"instruction": "This is hard to talk about.", "input": "", "output": "If it makes you uncomfortable..."}, {"instruction": "We had phone sex, okay?", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Apparently Sharon is not all that happy with Antoine. They've been having frequent squabbles and she's questioning her love for him. He got a job in Indiana and he wants Sharon to drop everything and move with him and abandon her own career goals after college. She told me she had forgotten how comfortable I made her feel talking to her and then we talked about our sexual experiences together. Soon Sharon's voice began dipping down a couple octaves and she slowly whispered things she wanted to do with me and pretty soon my fly was unzipped. Graphic enough for you yet?", "input": "", "output": "I'm getting the idea."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, we talked again the next night and we're meeting in a chat room on the Internet tonight. I don't exactly know why I'm letting her do this to me again, but I can't help it. I haven't felt this hopeful in a long time.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel the two of you will renew your relationship? Do you think that, somehow, you'll be together again despite the miles between you?"}, {"instruction": "No. My gut says no. But I want exactly that. I want her back. I need her. I need somebody. I feel like she's rescued me. A few months more of what I was going through emotionally before my vacation, and I would have killed myself.", "input": "", "output": "You honestly believe that?"}, {"instruction": "I can only tell you how I felt. When I was feeling that hopeless, visions of death flooded my mind. How else would you describe that?", "input": "", "output": "You're more levelheaded than you give yourself credit for. I don't think you would have taken your own life, especially when you're in the midst of treatment and are so eager to improve. My feelings about your situation with Sharon are strong. You won't like my opinions but I'm not here to tell you what you want to hear. Your relationship with Sharon is destructive. It was based on emotional instability and your break-up ended on the same note. I feel you need to find the strength to move on before you can expect any type of healing. And even if you are able to renew a relationship with Sharon, you haven't been able to accomplish enough independently to give that relationship a chance of working. We'll have to talk more about this next week."}, {"instruction": "All right.", "input": "", "output": "How's next Friday at 4 p.m.?"}, {"instruction": "It still works for me.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you then."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "How are you?"}, {"instruction": "Good.", "input": "", "output": "It doesn't seem like that's true."}, {"instruction": "This whole Sharon ordeal is just getting ridiculous.", "input": "", "output": "You're kidding!"}, {"instruction": "I know, I know. You warned me. I feel like she's pulling my strings again. \"Hi, I'm Tom, the magic fucking puppet! Look at me! I can walk and talk and kiss your ass!\"", "input": "", "output": "That's an impressive Pinocchio imitation."}, {"instruction": "She's doing it to me all over again, and I'm letting her. Fucking bitch. She doesn't give me the time of day for two years and now, all of sudden, she wants to talk to me again. I can't have any association with her unless she dictates it and it's convenient for her spoiled ass. I should just ignore her phone calls and e-mails.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you?"}, {"instruction": "It's like what Eddie Murphy once said: when you're starving and someone throws you a moldy, soggy cracker, you scarf it down declaring all the while that it's the best tasting cracker you've ever had. It's the same idea with me and Sharon. I've been lonely for so long and then out of the blue she decides to call me and now I can't get enough of her. She's on my mind every day. I even have dreams about her.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about the dreams."}, {"instruction": "Well, in the dreams, I start off alone in what I guess is my apartment, only it's different from the one in real life. This apartment is all white and unbearably bright: the walls, the floors, the ceilings--everything.", "input": "", "output": "Is Sharon there?"}, {"instruction": "Not at first, no. The dream begins in a room I can only describe as a total blank. There isn't any furniture or any other articles there. All I see is the same penetrating whiteness that's so painful to look at; it compels me to shade my eyes. I start to get very frightened. I look around the room frantically until I can barely discern the silhouette of a person through the brightness. As I walk closer, I realize it's Sharon, but she isn't moving. She seems frozen in time and it's clear from her pose that she had been in the midst of talking and gesturing before she suddenly became still. I try to get her attention by yelling directly at her, but there's no response. I shake her violently, but still she doesn't react.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have a feeling associated with her frozen passivity?"}, {"instruction": "I feel frustrated and angry. I begin shouting obscenities at her. Finally, I pick her up and run with her in my arms to the bedroom. It is here that I see the only piece of furniture in the apartment: the bed.", "input": "", "output": "Is there anything out of the ordinary about it?"}, {"instruction": "The bed is very gaudy, incredibly large and it seems to somehow expand beyond the confines of the bedroom itself. The bedpost and headboard are ornately carved with tiny naked women in various poses, and there is a large mirror mounted over the mattress. I'm not sure, but I think the bed is heart-shaped, like you'd find in one of those honeymoon suites they show on TV.", "input": "", "output": "What happens next?"}, {"instruction": "I toss Sharon onto the bed. Suddenly, the intense whiteness of the room is replaced by a red illumination, much like what comes from the lights you'd find in a photographer's darkroom, only this is slightly brighter. Sharon's once frozen form now springs to life, and she smiles at me mischievously, sitting up on her hands and knees and tossing her hair back. She brings up her right hand and motions with her index finger to come to her. At this point, I'm quite aroused. I soon forget all the emptiness I felt with her in the other room when she wouldn't speak to me. Racing into bed, I claw eagerly at her blouse and she lets me remove it. We soon have each other's clothes off and I begin kissing her everywhere. Sharon points downward, signaling that she wants me to perform oral sex. Kissing her breasts and her stomach on the way down, I willingly do as she asks. After several moments, we return to kissing and begin to have intercourse. As she's on top of me, I look at the mirror and watch her movements. Then the mirror seems to fade away to reveal a group of people I don't recognize staring down at us. Sharon begins moaning, softly at first, then with louder cries. Finally she screams, \"Oh, Antoine!\" I am stunned by what she says, but continue to have sex. The people above begin pointing at me and laughing, as if to say, \"Ha, ha! The joke's on you, dumbass!\" When the both of us reach climax, Sharon and I hold and touch each other playfully. I ask her to take a bath with me, and she agrees. As we stand up, I begin talking to Sharon about all the things I want to do now that we're back together, only to find when I turn to her that she is once again frozen in time. I begin crying and the room turns white again. That's when I wake up.", "input": "", "output": "Is this dream recurring?"}, {"instruction": "I have variations of it, but this version is by far the most vivid and memorable. So what do you think the dream means?", "input": "", "output": "Dreams are very helpful in determining one's state of mind, but it's my belief that they are best interpreted from the individual who experiences them. What do you think it means?"}, {"instruction": "It seems to reflect my past relationship with Sharon. We never really had anything much in common except the sex. She used to ask me sometimes why we didn't talk more than we did, and I'd never really know what to tell her. We were so many years apart that it was difficult to see things from her younger perspective. I found the best way to communicate to her and show my feelings was through sex.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like the obvious comparison between your life and the dream. What do you think about the other aspects you described, such as the bright white light versus the red? What of the people laughing at you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, during the periods in the dream when there was a blinding whiteness, I felt very helpless and alone, but during the time when I was in bed with Sharon, there was a lot more intense emotions going on: love, lust, joy, and ultimately, uneasiness.", "input": "", "output": "The uneasiness came when Sharon cried out the name of her fianc\u00e9, right?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes, definitely during that time, but there was a constant level of it throughout the sexual episode. It was like a feeling of impending doom. I couldn't fully trust her, which prevented me from being completely satisfied. And the people laughing at me seemed to represent more my feelings of how other people felt about my relationship with someone much younger than myself.", "input": "", "output": "Interesting."}, {"instruction": "I guess that's really the root of my problem socializing: worrying too much about what others think and not trusting anyone.", "input": "", "output": "I agree that a lack of trust can make it difficult to open up."}, {"instruction": "Which is why I want to trust Sharon's intentions now. I want to believe she's not out to hurt me again. That's why I wanted to keep the lines of communication open until recently.", "input": "", "output": "So you feel that Sharon intended to hurt you when she broke off your relationship?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I guess not really intentionally, no. But she hurt me even if she didn't mean to.", "input": "", "output": "It was the circumstances of the situation, Tom. The age difference and the beginning of her college life were the primary factors, as we've discussed before."}, {"instruction": "I guess so. So why does she want to have anything to do with me now, when we never had anything in common?", "input": "", "output": "It's not uncommon for some people to explore past relationships in the midst of emotionally trying times. But these situations are almost always temporary."}, {"instruction": "Well, you've pretty much made up my mind that I'm not going to get back together with her. I'm not going to brush her off completely, but I will set some boundaries.", "input": "", "output": "So long as you don't depend on her to provide you happiness, I don't see too much problem with keeping the channels open. I don't want you investing all your time in her when you could be working on improving your own social life."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know. Don't worry, I'm beginning to see that now.", "input": "", "output": "Well, our time's about up."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Let's see.  Next Friday is the Independence Day Holiday.  Why don't we skip our next session and I'll see you in two weeks?  That would be July 11th, okay?"}, {"instruction": "That sounds good.", "input": "", "output": "And remember, if you need to talk to me before then, you can always give me a call."}, {"instruction": "Sure, I know.  See you later, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "How have you been?"}, {"instruction": "Do you really want to know or are you just shooting off pleasantries?", "input": "", "output": "No, I really want to know. It seems you've changed these past couple weeks."}, {"instruction": "In what way?", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be in a very pensive frame of mind."}, {"instruction": "Taking myself off the drug probably has something to do with it.", "input": "", "output": "Excuse me?"}, {"instruction": "The Librium. I stopped taking it.", "input": "", "output": "And why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I've been reading up on it. It sounds no better than the Ritalin doctors prescribed me when I was younger. It's a type of drug that only should be used on a short-term basis. I hear it fucks with your body, that it zones you out, makes you feel lethargic and decreases your sex drive. I think those are symptoms that related to me of late. I realized that since you'd put me on the medication, I didn't really feel any more at ease in social situations, I just felt...indifferent. I didn't fucking care about anything or anyone. I didn't care if people said things about me in hushed circles; I didn't care who was winning the ballgame on TV; I didn't care that my smoke detector was going off for five minutes because I had burnt something in the oven; I didn't care if there was a big stringy booger protruding from a nostril while I was talking to someone; and I definitely didn't get aroused enough to keep up with my usual whack-off schedule. So I stopped taking it.", "input": "", "output": "How long ago?"}, {"instruction": "About three weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Tom, this is a prime example of your trouble trusting the judgment or intentions of others. My goal by prescribing this medication was to help give you that extra push you seemed to need to get out into social situations and maintain yourself on a competent level. I planned on keeping you on the drug until such time as I deemed you were ready to handle these situations without its influence. That could have taken weeks or months. You're right in that it shouldn't be used long term, but it was not my intention to keep you on the Librium for a significant amount of time."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm off it. As of now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not going to force you to take anything you don't feel comfortable taking."}, {"instruction": "You fucking doctors like to ignore our fucking real problems and simply look for the quick fix. \"Here, Tom, here's some fucking drugs to send you to La-La Land. Have a nice day!\" Fuck that. I mean, really Charles, what the hell do you know about me except for what comes up in these little 45 minute sessions of ours? Nothing. Not a damn thing. Your expensive degree in psycho-skull-fucking doesn't give you the extra sensory perception to see into my future and look through my fucking eyes and know how the fuck I'm going to feel under certain fucking conditions. You know what? I'm beginning to think all you shrinks are scam-artists. Hell, if I had known I could take some bullshit classes and graduate to a big city, working out of a plush office and throwing out bad advice to people who aren't worth spit, I'd have changed my fucking major.", "input": "", "output": "You can take the drugs or not take them. That's your choice. If you feel that I'm not helping you, then you need to decide whether you'd like to either discontinue therapy or seek help from another provider. I will say this: I'm very devoted to my work and to my patients. I would not recklessly throw different drugs at you, hoping that some stick and solve your problems. Therapy is a process between a patient and a professional trained to understand mental processes and reactions. I'd say at least 70% of the healing process is completely in the patient's hands. If that patient is not interested in participating, then it is very difficult for the professional to accomplish much. I don't know everything about you, that is true, but I know enough to have a strong grasp of the influences in your life and the emotions they evoke. I'm very willing to help you but I need your complete cooperation. Is that fair?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Give me a few minutes. I have to collect myself.", "input": "", "output": "Take your time."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, take as much time as you need--I get my co-payment from you either way.", "input": "", "output": "There you go again."}, {"instruction": "I know.  I'm sorry.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right."}, {"instruction": "Well, do you want to know what happened to me this week?", "input": "", "output": "Of course.  Are you ready for that?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I got a cat.", "input": "", "output": "Really? What kind?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. A black one. A kitten. She just opened her eyes a few days ago.", "input": "", "output": "What's her name?"}, {"instruction": "Katherine, with a \"K.\" \"Kat\" for short.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "That way I can just say, \"Hey, Kat, get off that table!\" \"Come here, Kat!\" \"Oh Kat, dinner!\"", "input": "", "output": "Very original."}, {"instruction": "I'm not good with naming animals.", "input": "", "output": "Had you been looking to get a pet?"}, {"instruction": "No. Basically, everyone was pressuring me to do it. My mom, my brother, my co-workers--hell, even Sharon suggested it. They all felt it would be good for me since I live alone. A girl from work has a cat that had given birth to a litter, so she offered me first pick. I think I got one so everybody would get off my back about not having a pet.", "input": "", "output": "So you don't really want the cat?"}, {"instruction": "I do and I don't. I know having a pet will get my mind off my loneliness to a certain degree, but I don't feel it'd be fair to the animal to not really love it or care about it.", "input": "", "output": "I think in time you'll grow attached to it."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I feel guilty. She may have been perfect for another owner who would have truly loved her, but I took her instead. It just doesn't seem right of me to be doing this. What if I don't grow to love her? Or what if she ends up hating me after a while and we both realize we've wasted each other's time?", "input": "", "output": "Are we still talking about the cat?"}, {"instruction": "As far as I know. Why?", "input": "", "output": "For a minute I got the impression you were speaking metaphorically."}, {"instruction": "Oh.", "input": "", "output": "You said Sharon also suggested getting the cat. I take it she's still in the picture?"}, {"instruction": "We are e-mailing each other about once a week. Seems like we're more pen pals now than anything else, which I guess is fine. I know there's nothing more of our relationship and I think she's realizing that, too. It sounds like her wedding jitters have subsided. So I'm happy for her.", "input": "", "output": "But it doesn't solve the issue of your lovelife."}, {"instruction": "True, it doesn't, but I'm getting used to that now.", "input": "", "output": "But that's counterproductive. We don't want you to be getting used to your situation. The idea is to get you back on a social track."}, {"instruction": "I know. I've been pretty despondent lately. When I stopped taking the Librium, my body seemed to take it pretty hard. I got very depressed. For about three nights straight, I drank myself to sleep. Eventually I started feeling a little better, or at least on the same level I was before taking the drug. I just want to venture out socially knowing that I accomplished it and not the drugs. Can you understand that?", "input": "", "output": "I can."}, {"instruction": "So no more drugs, okay?", "input": "", "output": "If you don't want them, I'm not going to prescribe them. We'll look at other alternatives, of which there are several."}, {"instruction": "So what's the next step?", "input": "", "output": "Continued exposure to social settings. You were a journalism major, right? Perhaps you can join a writing club. I'm sure that bookstore you frequent offers some of those types of programs, as I've seen groups meet there myself."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. They usually horde the area just off to the side of the coffee shop.", "input": "", "output": "Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I haven't really written anything in a long while. I don't see myself as a writer anymore. I'm just a computer geek pecking away in a cubicle eight hours a day. That's the extent of my identity.", "input": "", "output": "It's up to you."}, {"instruction": "We'll see.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Same time, next week?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, I'm going to be pretty busy next week. Could we make it two weeks from today?", "input": "", "output": "We can. Is Friday, August 8th at 4 p.m. good for you?"}, {"instruction": "That's fine.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I'll see you then. Goodbye, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "So how is Tom today?"}, {"instruction": "Tom is shitty today, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "And why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, a collection of things that seem to happen to me in the truest spirit of Murphy's Law.", "input": "", "output": "For example?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, let's start with the cat. This kitten has so far served as a constant scratching, pooping, biting reminder that I really don't like animals all that much.", "input": "", "output": "What is it doing?"}, {"instruction": "She's dominating my life at home. She knows more about getting her way than I know how to control her. Claws--I renamed the cat last week for obvious reasons--has learned to manipulate me better than any woman could have. I usually eat supper in the living room, watching TV. Claws refuses to leave me alone. She'll jump onto the coffee table and wants to drink whatever I'm drinking and delve her cat litter-encrusted paws into my food. I throw her off but she'll just jump back up. A couple days ago, I literally spent fifteen minutes throwing her off the table and watching her jump back on before I gave up.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you have a little devil on your hands."}, {"instruction": "I can't have a moment's peace in my own apartment. She has to be around me almost all the time. I tried closing her out of the bathroom once and she meowed and clawed at the door until finally I got so annoyed that I had to give in. If I hadn't, I'm sure there'd be serious damage to my door right now. And then the poop--oh, don't even get me started on that. I've shit in her litter box more times than she has. Claws finds my couch to be much more convenient. What's so damn funny about this?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Tom. I think you're taking this a bit too seriously."}, {"instruction": "That's easy for you to say. You're not awaking to a living feline nightmare of hairballs and catnip-induced attacks on her owner.", "input": "", "output": "There are steps you can take to control your cat. I've heard a spray-bottle filled with water works wonders. If Claws is doing something you don't want her to be doing, you can squirt her with water. She'll soon get the idea that doing those things brings about bad consequences."}, {"instruction": "And the cat shit? How the hell do I stop her from shitting all over the place?", "input": "", "output": "I'm no expert on the subject but I've heard you can lock the cat in a room with her food and her litter box and she'll start using the litter box exclusively."}, {"instruction": "It's all such a pain in the ass. I wish I had it as good as that damn cat. Eat and shit, eat and shit--wheeeee! Look at me! She has no worries. I, on the other hand, have to deal with people like those at my insurance company on a regular basis.", "input": "", "output": "What happened with your insurance company?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm just high-risk at the moment as far as auto insurance goes. I've had three accidents in two years, two of which were my fault, but they take all the accidents into account and label me high risk. So now I get this letter in the mail saying I now have to pay $1000 every six months just to drive back and forth to a job I hate anyway. I tried to go through another insurance company but they turned me down because of my driving record. I mean what do you expect? This is San Francisco, for Christ's sake!", "input": "", "output": "If I were you, I'd start using the city's transit system."}, {"instruction": "No way. I need that freedom with my car to be alone and away from everything. It's really the only way you can truly have some semblance of privacy anymore. It's just me and the radio and...", "input": "", "output": "...traffic jams."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. But as long as you're in your car, it's like you're separated from the outside world. You don't have to really deal with anyone, and the people in the cars around you aren't really people, you know what I mean? They're just non-descript, boxy metal objects scurrying about that drive too slow or cut you off from time to time.", "input": "", "output": "Do you find yourself escaping to your car often?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I don't like interaction with people, as you well know by now. Driving my car is one of the few things that still gives me some sense of satisfaction.", "input": "", "output": "And protection."}, {"instruction": "What's that?", "input": "", "output": "It protects you from having to cope with people on a social level. You can be amongst people and yet not have to interact with anyone. If you ever feel uncomfortable, you simply drive away."}, {"instruction": "Well, there must be a lot of anti-social people out there besides myself--look at drive-thrus at fast-food restaurants or at banks. No one wants to deal with other people if they don't have to.", "input": "", "output": "That's different. That's a matter of convenience."}, {"instruction": "Bullshit. It's because people don't want to deal. They'd rather listen to a barely discernable voice crackling back their order than talk to them face-to-face.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps. But I still think it's a matter of convenience for most people. For you, it's clearly a different story."}, {"instruction": "Well, whatever. I think maybe you're reading too much into what I'm saying, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "That's my job. Not necessarily reading in \"too much\" but I do explore avenues you may not have considered."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, I have been having some serious relapses when it comes to relating to people lately. I thought maybe I was getting better but I've come to realize I still have anxiety attacks over it.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if you know about this, but every year at SII, the company reviews the performance of certain individuals who excel and they reward them by herding them together to have a week-long drink-fest in the Bahamas. They get together with the president of the company and have presentations and pass out awards and drink a lot of beer. Well, Dave Torriello, my manager, picked me to represent the Help Desk.", "input": "", "output": "That's great! Congratulations."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to go.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Because all the VPs and heads and managers and staunch corporate types will be there and I'll be forced to mingle with them and because I'm afraid, frankly. I am so scared of people that I even skipped the announcement that Dave gave to everyone in the IT department. I couldn't muster the courage to be surrounded by 50 people at once, gathered together to stare at me as he announced his pick.", "input": "", "output": "There are 50 people?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not in the Help desk area, but with all the departments combined in IT, there are about 50 people. So all the managers for all the departments announced their picks. At least, so I hear.", "input": "", "output": "What did Dave say afterward?"}, {"instruction": "He was...concerned. My defensiveness with customers was an issue earlier in the year, but my performance improved greatly and my statistics far exceed those of anyone else in the department. Plus Rob Farber changed departments and now works as an engineer in Network Operations. So now there's just me, Jennifer Keys and Doris Meckle. Dave figured I was covering the phones at the time, so I went along with it. I told him I was working on a critical issue and couldn't leave my desk for the meeting.", "input": "", "output": "So how did you feel when he asked everyone to meet with the rest of the IT department?"}, {"instruction": "I was petrified. I got sweaty and my heart started racing and I felt like a cornered animal. I knew what the meeting was for and knew that if I'd go, I'd be singled out. I can't stand that. I like the fact that many people can't associate a name to my face. At the same time, I know it's wrong to feel that way. As soon as I got off work, I went straight home and drank a six-pack. Guess I was self-medicating again.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds that way."}, {"instruction": "I know what you're thinking. I might as well be using the Librium if I'm going to use alcohol to achieve the same results.", "input": "", "output": "Not necessarily. Last time you were here, you were very adamant that the side effects outweighed the value of the drug in relation to your social life. If we started you back on that medication, the side effects you reported are likely to recur. On the other hand, I'd rather you not turn to alcohol at the first sight of a crowd."}, {"instruction": "Well, it was only a six-pack. Not like I chugged a case or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Six straight beers is still fairly significant."}, {"instruction": "I guess.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Well, next week, let's discuss this trip you've been chosen to take--when is it scheduled for, by the way?"}, {"instruction": "Sometime in October, I think.", "input": "", "output": "Good, that gives us some time.  Okay. Next week, same time?"}, {"instruction": "How about Friday the 22nd.", "input": "", "output": "If you want to skip a week, I understand.  But try to get out a little.  I want you to start gradually and try to get used to people."}, {"instruction": "Hey.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks for accommodating me by switching our appointment to today.  How have you been?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Two weeks ago we discussed your trepidation over this business trip you'll be taking in October."}, {"instruction": "It's not really a business trip. The company's flying us to the Bahamas as sort of a celebration of our job performance. There will be a lot of drinking, which I'm more than comfortable with.", "input": "", "output": "But you're not comfortable with the idea of being among the other employees."}, {"instruction": "No. There will be about three hundred of them, none of whom I really know except for maybe the few I've talked to over the phone.", "input": "", "output": "So instead of being excited about this honor..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, right.", "input": "", "output": "Come on!  Of course it's an honor.  But you're not looking forward to it and you'd like very much to get out of it."}, {"instruction": "Yes, which puts me in a quandary. I'm torn between my fear of people and my responsibilities as an SII employee. So far, I've been successful at making sure the two factors never mixed. Now, I think they will. When Dave Torriello told me I had been chosen to go on this trip, I wanted to rush out of his office screaming \"No, no, no,\" but I knew that if I did that, it would have put me in a poor light.", "input": "", "output": "Isn't he already aware that you've sought therapy?"}, {"instruction": "He originally suggested indirectly that I go to therapy, but that was because he felt I was getting too defensive when I was talking with customers. He has no idea how profound my fear of people is, or that I have this fear at all.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you feel that it's inevitable that your fear will manifest itself during this Bahama trip?"}, {"instruction": "During the trip, there's a recognition ceremony. All the employees will be corralled together in an auditorium and they'll be asked to walk on stage, accept their award, and stay up there for pictures with the President. I'm absolutely dreading it. To make matters worse, SII will film the event for their yearly propaganda video they show to trainees. All this time, I've felt like I've been put up in front of everyone for display, and now it will literally happen. I've been thinking about skipping this ceremony once I fly down there. Maybe just stay in my hotel room or something and say that I'm ill, which I guess isn't too far from the truth.", "input": "", "output": "Tom, do me a favor. Don't do that."}, {"instruction": "Easy for you to say. You can't know what this fear feels like. It's overwhelming. It's paralyzing. I may throw jokes at you every now and then about it but I really want you to know this is truly horrifying for me.", "input": "", "output": "I know it is, Tom. But the only way you can overcome the fear is to confront it. Your fear seems to have stemmed from some event in your past and you have since used other events to reinforce that fear. I'd like to try a desensitization technique if you'll allow me."}, {"instruction": "Does this entail my taking off my clothes and running up and down the street screaming, \"The British are coming, the British are coming?\"", "input": "", "output": "No, hardly ever. Come with me."}, {"instruction": "Wait! We're going to leave the office?  Where are we going?", "input": "", "output": "You'll see."}, {"instruction": "I don't like that answer.", "input": "", "output": "You'll have to trust me.  Take your stuff.  Let me lock the door."}, {"instruction": "Just tell me you're taking me to a bar and treating me to a couple shots.", "input": "", "output": "Well...no. Nice try."}, {"instruction": "Seriously, where are we going? How long are we going to be?", "input": "", "output": "Only until the end of the hour. My, you ask a lot of questions when you feel cornered."}, {"instruction": "I don't feel cornered, I...", "input": "", "output": "Let's go."}, {"instruction": "Great. Here I am coming to you to try to talk about my problems and you're taking me on some kind of psycho-field trip.", "input": "", "output": "Isn't the weather nice today? Perfect time of the year--not too cold, not too hot..."}, {"instruction": "I need a drink.", "input": "", "output": "Nonsense. Oh, you ever been to that restaurant over there? Quite a nice place."}, {"instruction": "No, I usually don't go to a fancy restaurant just to eat by myself. Can we go back now?", "input": "", "output": "Keep walking."}, {"instruction": "Great. San Francisco, late afternoon, two guys strolling along pointing at things. We look like a couple of fags.", "input": "", "output": "You're not my type."}, {"instruction": "Neither are you. How much farther?", "input": "", "output": "Just around the corner.  Here."}, {"instruction": "Stacey's? You're taking me to a bookstore?", "input": "", "output": "I know this isn't the one you frequent but it will suffice for our little exercise."}, {"instruction": "Oh, great.", "input": "", "output": "Aren't you coming in?"}, {"instruction": "I've bought my quota of books for this month, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Let's go."}, {"instruction": "You can be a pushy bastard sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, quite. Now, here's the plan: I want you to select a woman in here and approach her."}, {"instruction": "You want me to what?", "input": "", "output": "This'll be good for you. A lot of your fear stems from desperately wanting to be liked--which makes it very difficult for you to say anything.  You overanalyze what you're going to say, so that you never end up saying anything at all.  Here, I'd like you to just gain some practice talking to strangers when you have nothing to lose.  I'm not looking for you to pick the woman of your dreams in here but I'd like you to practice speaking with strangers."}, {"instruction": "This is ridiculous. I'm out of here.", "input": "", "output": "Leave if you must, Tom, but we both know the only way you're going to get over this fear is if you face it head-on."}, {"instruction": "I've already told you I've been trying to go out and meet people. I don't need you holding my hand when I actually do it.", "input": "", "output": "You've also indicated your encounters ended in failure because you felt incapable of making conversation."}, {"instruction": "Well, suppose I do approach one of these women here...what the hell do I say? \"Hey, baby, I'd like to be your page-turner?\"", "input": "", "output": "No, this is a bookstore, not a bar. Say whatever comes to mind, within reason, of course. Please try. I'll be over there in the health and science section."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll do it, already. Jesus, this is crazy. Okay, get a hold of yourself, Tom. How about her?", "input": "", "output": "The brunette reading the magazine? Nice choice. Good luck."}, {"instruction": "This is so bizarre.", "input": "", "output": "Excuse me, could you tell me if you have a book in stock by Ben Watt called, \"Patient?\""}, {"instruction": "Were you watching?", "input": "", "output": "I glanced over my shoulder while you approached her. I'm assuming from that smile that it went well? What did she say?"}, {"instruction": "If I recall her exact words, she said, \"Go fuck yourself.\"", "input": "", "output": "Charming. What did you say to her to evoke such a response?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I noticed she was skimming through Cosmopolitan, so I stood beside her and commented that I enjoyed taking the quizzes they have in that magazine.", "input": "", "output": "And then?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's when she told me to go fuck myself.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So I guess that's it, then. Some people can approach women, others get stuck with a jar of Vaseline and a Penthouse.", "input": "", "output": "Tom, don't get discouraged by this. The point of this exercise was not to necessarily win someone over with your wit and charm, but to work on establishing communication in the light of uncomfortable circumstances."}, {"instruction": "It's true that when I finally did muster the strength to say something to her--just to get it out of my mouth--I felt a lot better.", "input": "", "output": "You see? That's wonderful! Of course her reaction was a bit crude and uncalled for, but don't blame yourself for her attitude. Rejection is a part of life, Tom. You're going to run into that regardless of how silver-tongued you might be. I'd like to continue this type of exercise during our next session, but we'll keep it in the office the second time around. Can you come by this Friday at the same time as our normal session?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "See you then."}, {"instruction": "What, you're just going to stay here?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, well I'm buying a few books. Take care!"}, {"instruction": "All right.", "input": "", "output": "I tried calling you back Thursday night but there was no answer."}, {"instruction": "I must have gone to buy more beer.", "input": "", "output": "Some of the things you said left me rather concerned, especially when you told me you were a loser and that I should kill you."}, {"instruction": "Just stupid things I say when I'm drunk. I was actually reciting the lyrics of a Beck song.", "input": "", "output": "Beck?"}, {"instruction": "He's a...oh, nevermind. It doesn't matter. I was feeling like shit that night, so I drank about five beers, ran out, and had to go buy more.", "input": "", "output": "So you were driving that night, too?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, although that was before all this traffic bullshit happened. All this week, I worked from home because the freeways have been too congested. It took me over an hour just to get here. This is getting ridiculous.", "input": "", "output": "You're referring to the effects of the BART strike?"}, {"instruction": "Yup. I've never seen so many cars and buses take to the streets since this happened. The strike is really slowing the city down to a crawl. I never realized how many people depend on those trains to get to where they're going. I guess it's a good thing I can do all my work from a laptop and modem.", "input": "", "output": "True."}, {"instruction": "And it got me thinking why I should even go to work at all? If I can successfully do my job remotely, why not do so on a permanent basis?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm sure the reason you aren't normally working from home has a lot to do with the type of support work you do. I imagine employees call a particular number to reach your helpdesk group when they need assistance, which you can't answer from your apartment."}, {"instruction": "Yes, but the bulk of the problems sent to us come via e-mail. So really there's no need to even have that number. They  could very easily do away with it.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure that would be perfect for you, not having to interact with anyone face-to-face."}, {"instruction": "Don't start with me. I'm talking pragmatics here. It's more logical in my mind to do this remotely if it's technically feasible. Why travel 15 miles just to sit in a cubicle and accomplish the same damn thing?", "input": "", "output": "Earlier you told me how driving your car was the only means of freedom you had away from people. Now you want to work from your apartment. This is not a particularly healthy turn for you. How do you expect to cope with the social environment you'll face at SII's awards function in the Bahamas?"}, {"instruction": "I don't. I'm going to find some way out of it.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I've already told you, damn it! I will be thrown into a crowd of over 300 people I don't know from branches all across the country. I don't have any friends who also work at SII, so there will be this pressure for me to join conversations and groups where I don't belong, like being a third wheel. It's like in gym class where one guy picks people for his team and chooses you last. I'm participating, but not because I really want to or anybody really wants me to. I don't like parties. I don't like mingling with people. Why is it so wrong to want to just be alone? Why do I have to \"network\" or whatever the fuck they call it now? I don't want anything to do with it.", "input": "", "output": "Were you picked last in gym class activities as a kid?"}, {"instruction": "A few times...who the fuck cares? I have never fit in, Charles. Growing up, I was always the loner, the outcast. I stayed home all through high school, never going out with friends. People say that underage drinking and sex is wrong but all the people who did that in school seemed to have turned out better than I have.", "input": "", "output": "This fear of rejection is very deeply rooted in you, isn't it?"}, {"instruction": "I don't fear those bastards. Fear is not the issue. Fuck people. Fuck what they think. I couldn't care less.", "input": "", "output": "If that were true, you'd have no qualms about going to this Bahama function."}, {"instruction": "It's different. I'm being asked to participate in an activity I don't want to participate in. And the only reason I didn't immediately refuse the offer my boss made is because I have to play the fucking corporate game of \"yes, sir, no sir\" to get anywhere. If I had refused, it would have had a profoundly negative impact on me in terms of my relationship with management.", "input": "", "output": "Not necessarily."}, {"instruction": "You don't know dick. You've been sitting in this office too long. That's the way the game works out there. You play by their rules or you end up getting fucked for life.", "input": "", "output": "You're just as much a player in the game as anyone else, and therefore possess just as much power to change the course of the game, if you wish to use that analogy."}, {"instruction": "That's right. That's exactly why I didn't turn down the offer to go on this trip to represent the helpdesk.", "input": "", "output": "But you said you were going to find a way out of it."}, {"instruction": "I can now come up with some sort of excuse that would seem more legitimate than if I had turned down the offer immediately, yes.", "input": "", "output": "Such as?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know! Tell them my mother is sick and she needs my help or something. If I tell them it's for personal reasons, that's all they need to know. They can then get a replacement for me if I announce it soon enough.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a perfect plan to me. Perhaps you could hire someone to go out and do your grocery shopping and run your errands for you, too?"}, {"instruction": "Funny.", "input": "", "output": "What's the worst thing in your mind that can happen if you manage to get on this plane and arrive in the Bahamas in October?"}, {"instruction": "I picture 300 people meeting at the reception by the swimming pool in front of the hotel, all drinking and mingling and laughing and having a good time.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a nice scenario. And where are you when all this is happening?"}, {"instruction": "I'm holding one opened beer and one unopened beer, sitting by myself noticeably outside the circle of people, staring off into the night, drinking in silent contemplation of fading away, hoping no one sees me and points out to others how anti-social I am. Either that or I end up staying in my hotel room and watching the festivities below from a balcony.", "input": "", "output": "What about the awards ceremony itself? When you're asked to come onstage? Where are you then?"}, {"instruction": "Wherever I am, I intend to be quite sloshed. Most likely I will still be in my hotel room or perhaps just standing outside of the auditorium, listening as my name is called and the awkward silence and mutterings when I don't show up.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps you're not in a condition to participate in this event after all. You truly seem distraught over this. I believe that if you do muster up the strength to board the plane, you'd probably do exactly as you suggest."}, {"instruction": "You see! That's what I've been trying to tell you all this time! Finally you're beginning to understand!", "input": "", "output": "Tom, I know you probably won't like this suggestion, but have you considered returning to the medication?"}, {"instruction": "Get back on the Librium? That's your fucking answer? Drug me up again! Admit it! You're confounded by me, aren't you? You are realizing now that there is no changing my character. This is who I am. This is who I will continue to be.", "input": "", "output": "I believe no such thing. Change can happen when the will is there. My only suggestion to you is to have the courage and will power to force yourself to go to this function; to force yourself to interact with people, no matter how painful; and to force yourself on stage to accept that award. These are barriers I feel are important for you to encounter and overcome if you hope to succeed at change."}, {"instruction": "It is not in my nature to participate in social activities like these, period. I don't feel these barriers are important in my life. I'd sooner find a different route.", "input": "", "output": "The easiest one."}, {"instruction": "The only one that fits my nature. Look, I better get going. I'm starting to get really pissed off, and the traffic is just going to make things worse. Can we pick this up later?", "input": "", "output": "If you insist. Next week?"}, {"instruction": "Make it two.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Goodbye, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Tom.

You had mentioned sometime in October..."}, {"instruction": "October twelfth through the nineteenth.", "input": "", "output": "Less than three weeks away. How do you feel about it now? Are you going to go?"}, {"instruction": "I talked it over with Karina, and she's basically convinced me to go through with it. So I'm not going to bail out after all.", "input": "", "output": "Karina?"}, {"instruction": "Haven't I talked about her before? No? Well, we met on the Internet, of all places. Just don't spread it around, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, don't worry. Do you think it's a bad way to meet?"}, {"instruction": "It just smacks of loser. It's funny, in a way. Couples I've been acquainted with over the years have met in the strangest places--one guy I knew met his wife at a car wash. And yet no one ever really criticizes or questions where you've met your significant other unless you say you met on the Internet. There's just this horrible stigma about it. You feel inferior to others when you tell people that's how you've met--like you can't pick up women any other way. I guess in my case, it happens to be the truth.", "input": "", "output": "Is this why you haven't told me about Karina before? Because the way in which the two of you met makes you uncomfortable?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Maybe. She even told me not to tell anyone how we'd met. So I know it bothers her, too.", "input": "", "output": "Could you tell me about her?"}, {"instruction": "She's my age and was born and raised in Brazil, but has lived in San Francisco for the past six years. I've known her over two months now. She had sent me an e-mail after reading my personal profile on America Online--an account I don't have anymore. She noticed that I was interested in writing and film making, and so she wanted to talk. I responded, and we ended up calling each other a few times and eventually arranged a meeting. We've been doing things together periodically ever since. I think she's very lovely. When I first saw her, there was something about her features that seemed familiar, as if I'd met her before. Karina's eyes remind me of Salma Hayek's. She's about five foot three and one hundred and twenty pounds and works as a sales rep for a broadcast company. I think she sells air time to sponsors or something like that.", "input": "", "output": "Are the two of you romantically engaged?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "No?"}, {"instruction": "We're just friends.", "input": "", "output": "By the tone of your voice, I take it you're not satisfied with that."}, {"instruction": "Not really, but there's nothing I can do about it. She recently broke it off with her boyfriend of five years, so she's in rebound mode right now. The first couple weeks after our meeting, Karina made several passes at me, and we even made out a couple times. Lately, though, she's gotten completely cold and told me that she doesn't want to get involved in another relationship and make the same mistakes twice--that's despite throwing hypotheticals my way only last month about wanting to start something. It's frustrating, because every time I'm near her I want to touch her, but I can't. Fuck! What a life. Why can every low-life on this planet get laid except for me?", "input": "", "output": "Do you just want sex?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't just want sex. But it'd be fucking nice. I've developed a bond with her. We could definitely be good friends. But I feel it could be much more than that, if only I were Catholic. She wants someone who's particularly god-fearing, and I've made it clear that I'm not. So in her mind, we're completely incompatible.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Lately, though, we haven't been going out much. The main difference between Karina and me is that she actually has a life. She has friends. She socializes. But I fear the real reason she doesn't want a relationship with me is because I'm a complete zero in her eyes. She told me once that she has this problem being attracted to people whom she can mother. I'm sort of like this wounded puppy to her. She talks to me as if I have so much to learn--very patronizing, in fact--and therefore I don't think there's a lot of respect there. I guess I made a mistake when I opened up to her and told her I was seeing a therapist. Now, I feel like the only reason she ever calls is to use me for something.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "She is going to school while she works. So a lot of times she'll come over to my apartment just to work on her term papers and reports on my computer. She also asks me a lot of computer questions. And lately, since she just moved in to a new apartment, she's asked me to come over, and I end up helping her unpack. After we're done, we'd usually sit down and watch a video together. But of course I can never cross the line while we're near each other. We can never be more than what we are now.", "input": "", "output": "Do you really believe that's the only reason she wants to see you...that she doesn't value you as a friend?"}, {"instruction": "In my mind, I feel like I'm not really an official human being to her. It's like she feels I'm safe to talk to because I don't really have half a brain, or have feelings, or could add any kind of self-reflecting insight to her life. Lately, I've called her house and get no answer. And I actually got horribly jealous because I imagined she was out with a real man who was giving her a really great time by injecting her with a really big dick. It drives me crazy.", "input": "", "output": "To me, it sounds more like she wants a friend and perhaps makes excuses to see you--like coming over to use your computer and so forth. She may not want a romantic entanglement right now, but from what I've heard so far, I think you may be misinterpreting her intentions."}, {"instruction": "She may have been making excuses like that to see me in the beginning, but I don't think that's the case now--it doesn't happen anymore. She hasn't been to my apartment in three weeks. If I want to see her, I have to go to her apartment. She doesn't call like she used to, and whenever I call her, she's never around. She's now hooked up her answering machine. Goddamn it, why is this tearing me apart? I don't believe in destiny or anything. But out of nowhere, she'd came into my life and when I first saw her, as I said, I felt something. I felt like there was a very special quality about her. Damnit, I really like this woman. But it can't go on like this. It can't! It's not fucking fair!", "input": "", "output": "It's only been a couple months, Tom. Why don't you give her more time and focus on the friendship? Perhaps eventually she'll change her mind."}, {"instruction": "I've already botched our friendship.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "I sent her an e-mail over a week ago telling her I felt it was best if we didn't see each other anymore. I told her the reason was that I was attracted to her and wanted something more than she could give. I said that I felt she was just using me like all women use me, and that my life sucks, and that I don't want to drag her down with me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Then she sends me this reply saying that she doesn't see me that way, and that she really enjoys being around me, and that she won't give up on me so easily.", "input": "", "output": "That doesn't sound like you botched anything..."}, {"instruction": "Then last Saturday, I drank about ten beers and passed out early in the evening. When I awoke around one in the morning, I called her and woke her up and just started rambling about who the hell knows what. I'm sure I sounded like a lunatic, and I vaguely recall saying some rude things. I may have even scared her.", "input": "", "output": "And you think this phone call was disturbing enough that she won't want to talk to you again?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so, because I haven't heard from her all week.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "By the way, Charles, it wasn't just happenstance that I mentioned her name. I wanted to talk to you about this.", "input": "", "output": "I know."}, {"instruction": "Why am I this way? Why is it that crazier, uglier, stupider people can still manage to find love in their lives, and I fucking can't? I mean, I know I'm semi-intelligent and semi-attractive. I know that because if I weren't, Karina wouldn't have shown the interest she did early on. I also know that if I didn't have all these fucking problems, I'd have a better job and lots of friends and a wife and kids and a dog that doesn't shit on the carpet. Instead I'm a dreary man going nowhere with a tedious, unfulfilling job, no friends, a lot of empty beer cans, and a cat who purposely shits in her litter box right when I've sat down to eat my dinner, so the whole fucking apartment smells like creeping death and my appetite is ruined and I flip angrily through the TV channels listening to people dissect Princess Di's accident about fifty million different fucking times, criticizing the tabloids for causing her death and banking on her misfortune while at the same time advertising their own network's six-hour special report on her. Then I watch commercials selling Princess Di postage stamps, and plates, and T-shirts, and toilet paper holders, and whatever the hell else they can think to stick a picture of Princess Diana on. And in the midst of this, in the midst of all this shit, I'm thinking, \"What a fucking life this is! Look how grand and important we humans are!\" Well, you know what? Fuck this life. There's nothing particularly precious about it. I just wish I could fade away, drift from society, and in doing so somehow become absolutely pure in my loneliness. Are you getting this all down, Charles?", "input": "", "output": "Whew! I'll tell you, Tom--when you go off, you really don't leave much to the imagination. Try not to get too discouraged about your relationship with Karina. It almost sounds like you're purposely pushing her away to avoid being hurt. Take your time with her. And if she just wants to be friends, then you should try to accept that and build upon it. Give her a call and see if you can't patch things up, assuming there's any patchwork to do."}, {"instruction": "It's so damn difficult to accept, but I'll try. Well, I think I've pushed about all I can out into the open. Shall we schedule for next time?", "input": "", "output": "Sure. Can you come in Friday, October 10? That would be the Friday before your trip."}, {"instruction": "The plane doesn't leave until Saturday morning, so I guess that's fine.", "input": "", "output": "Very well."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Take care."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Charles. Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Tomorrow's the big day?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. My plane leaves at 6:45 am. I change planes in Dallas and then fly directly to Freeport International Airport on Grand Bahama Island. If you're American, you don't need a passport. But I went ahead and got one anyway--just in case I ever decide to do more traveling.", "input": "", "output": "What does your itinerary look like?"}, {"instruction": "Looks pretty busy--a lot of company briefings, meetings, and awards ceremonies with some free time to explore the island in between. I guess there's a giant marketplace down there in Port Lacuya that's worth seeing. If we have a lot of time on our hands, we might get a chance to visit some of the nearby islands. But from the looks of things, they're going to throw in a lot of boring company-related brown-nosing events to offset the fun.", "input": "", "output": "How are you feeling about this trip now? Any second thoughts?"}, {"instruction": "No. I'm really looking forward to it. I really am! I feel somehow that this is the start of a change for me--a change for the better.", "input": "", "output": "I've noticed you're in much higher spirits than you've been in long while, perhaps higher than I've ever seen from you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I don't know how to describe it, Charles. I've been depressed about my life's path and my future almost as long as I can remember. And then only a few days ago, I awoke with a completely different perspective on everything. I was suddenly overwhelmed with a sense of acceptance of my identity.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think this feeling will pass or do you think it's a sign of better things to come?"}, {"instruction": "You won't believe me when I say this, but yeah, I believe things are going to really start happening in my life--it will be unlike anything I've experienced before. I feel energetic again, and I'm looking toward the next few months with a great sense of enthusiasm.", "input": "", "output": "I'm very happy to hear this, Tom, but it all seems a bit sudden. I just hope you aren't trying to mask your anxiety with these feelings--not just from me but from yourself."}, {"instruction": "No, I don't think I am. I feel much more aware about things right now. It's like a quarter of my brain that had lain dormant all my life has suddenly activated, giving me a burst of clarity about what goals to achieve and how to make them happen.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I'll have to admit you seem to have changed. Dramatically. I really don't know whether to congratulate you or caution you, Tom. How are things with Karina, by the way?"}, {"instruction": "I called her back the night after our last session. We talked for about two hours. I let her know explicitly how I felt and why I had reacted the way I had. I told her I felt she was only being my friend when it was convenient for her and that she acted very patronizing toward me. She basically acknowledged that she had. We both agreed to cool off our seeing each other in any form for a little while. Besides, she has a very hectic quarter at night school, and she's investing more time than usual into her studies as a result. I haven't spoken to Karina since that night, but I'll see her before I leave--she's agreed to take care of my cat while I'm gone.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about this? Have you accepted the situation?"}, {"instruction": "I feel I have. It's time to move on, in more ways than one. I've wasted a lot of my life looking back on things and regretting all the opportunities I let slip from my grasp. I'm getting to an age now where I can't afford to ignore any more chances that come my way. I think my greatest problem in the past was waiting around for the big fish to swim by, overlooking the smaller ones that were more easily within reach. It's gotten to the point now where most of the schools have migrated to other waters and I'm running out of bait.", "input": "", "output": "You must be ready for an island vacation with an analogy like that one."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess so. It's true though. I need to start giving myself permission to explore the chances that now present themselves instead of remaining idle.", "input": "", "output": "It truly gives me hope to hear you say these things, and you seem truly optimistic. But there's this nagging voice in my head that tells me you're really just trying to make a sale. Are you simply attempting to convince me you're now okay?"}, {"instruction": "I don't feel I need to convince anyone. I know how I feel, and I'm really looking forward to what lies ahead.", "input": "", "output": "Then why did I just see murder in your eyes when I asked if you were trying to make a sale?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure I know...", "input": "", "output": "Of course you do. Tom, covering up your pain with this flowery speech about change isn't going to erase your problems. Like it or not, you're going to have to deal with them head on."}, {"instruction": "I have dealt with them head on, Charles. I assure you, I really have changed since you saw me last. We've spent countless sessions dealing with a lot of the things that have happened to me--all the crap in my life that has made me a bitter, cynical man. Through those sessions, I've realized that all my time is invested dwelling on the past, and in so doing, I've only added to the negativity on which I reflect. I'm constantly giving myself new material to brood upon.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. We're in agreement there."}, {"instruction": "Good! Whether you agree about the rest of it isn't important to me. I've made my conclusions, and I feel it's time to act upon them.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds to me like you have more plans than you're willing to disclose to me. Or perhaps you have no plans at all and are afraid someone might expose that fact?"}, {"instruction": "My plans aren't concrete, if that's what you're suggesting.", "input": "", "output": "I'm suggesting only that you're trying to make giant leaps when you should be taking small steps."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Mr. Armstrong.", "input": "", "output": "I'm serious. All too often, I've heard you speak of wanting to take these great strides and make dramatic changes. But what you don't realize is that getting to that point takes a series of smaller steps."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "You can't get from point \"A\" to point \"C\" without point \"B.\""}, {"instruction": "I get the picture.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Oh, is it time to leave already?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I have a lot of packing to do.", "input": "", "output": "Did you want to schedule another appointment before you go?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, can we leave that open for a while?", "input": "", "output": "Very well."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "You seem suddenly troubled. Is there something else?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing, really. I guess you've really had me pegged all along. I really don't have this great sense of who I am. Last week, I read this article about people who have committed suicide. In almost every instance documented, their friends and relatives talked about this period just before they died where they'd seemed very satisfied and happier than they'd ever been--completely at peace. Once they had made the decision to die, it was like this tremendous veil had been lifted from their eyes, and they could see everything clearly, and all their answers were before them. In their final decision they found true happiness. I envy that feeling, Charles. I envy the way those people felt. And I admire them. I really do. Take care of yourself, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Wait a minute, Tom.  Tom?"}, {"instruction": "Hello, Charles. I wish I could say I am as glad to see you.", "input": "", "output": "Last time, when you walked out the door, I was very concerned about you.

It gave me the license to skip every work-related meeting, dinner, and ceremony they had scheduled. At times, I'd sneak out of my hotel room to indulge in the spa and swimming pool. But most of the time, I spent flipping through pay-per-view porn and ordering room service, all on the company's tab, of course. The last day there, the director of the I.T. department knocked on my door, and I about shit my pants. When I let him in, he was clearly disappointed in me. I suspected he didn't really buy any part of my sick routine. He handed me the awards I would have received from the president of the company himself had I attended the ceremony. Then he said something briefly about hoping I felt better and quietly left. After that, I remember going down to the hotel bar and ordering drinks well into the night. I was so drunk, I had a buzz an hour after I had boarded the plane heading back home. When I returned to town and stepped into my apartment, I closed the door, curled up into a ball, and cried my eyes out.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear it turned out that way, Tom.

You mean decided, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "Do I?"}, {"instruction": "You've always been keen on that self-fulfilling prophetic bullshit. Yeah, so maybe I knew all along how it was going to turn out, and maybe I let my fears control my actions.

That all happened over five months ago. It's ancient history.", "input": "", "output": "Well, in any case, I'm pleased to know that you've decided not to abandon your efforts at improving yourself. Your return to therapy is indicative of that."}, {"instruction": "Who's to say I necessarily need you to improve myself?", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "I could have changed completely for the better these past five months, for all you know. I could have become a totally different person!", "input": "", "output": "But you're here."}, {"instruction": "I'm here.

The one that tells you to reevaluate your thinking and makes you feel guilty when you know you've done something you shouldn't have? I think I've lost that. I've lost my conscience. I come to you because I need to adopt an external one. I need an outside voice that can dictate to me the difference between right and wrong.", "input": "", "output": "Your conscience never leaves you, Tom. You may not trust it now, but it's still there. I think you've grown to ignore it. And you can't simply listen to what I have to say and expect progress. Progress is a two-way street."}, {"instruction": "I know that. That has always been my problem through life: being passive. I've sat idly by for many years, watching all my chances at success and happiness pass before my eyes. I've always been fearful of reaching out to grab those opportunities. It's so much easier and more comfortable for me to simply remain who I am: a loner.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but you've only grudgingly become a loner, Tom. You're not happy separating yourself from people. You want to be around others as much as you want to engage in more intimate relationships. But you're right--it is comfortable remaining in this state because you've endured it for years. Overnight success is not going to happen; I've never promised you that. The change will be slow, tedious, and frustrating for you, as it has been. Socializing with people in an acceptable manner takes practice, and like most people your age, you've simply not had it."}, {"instruction": "I just wish I was married like my little brother Alex. At least then, I'd have an excuse for having no life.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't think marriage was your immediate goal."}, {"instruction": "No, I'm not the marrying type. And even if I do one day manage to get my head screwed on straight, I don't think I'll marry even then. That kind of life is just not for me. But I do fantasize about it. I imagine myself being married with a couple of kids, a dog, and a big, green station wagon with wood paneling on the side. Except they don't really make station wagons anymore. They're called mini-vans now.", "input": "", "output": "That's true."}, {"instruction": "What I want is to be stable and healthy, have a long-term relationship with someone, and a regular schedule of sex. I'm twenty-six years old; I'll be twenty-seven in August. That big \"three-zero\" is looming ever closer. And what do I have to show for it? Some gray hair and a bad case of blue balls? And then, when I do have some interest in a woman, I somehow manage to screw it up, or they decide to \"just be friends\" with me. Fine. Be my friend. Just spread your legs for me now and then, would you?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, boy. The old Tom has returned."}, {"instruction": "You're damn right. I had this Brazilian bombshell whom I met over the Internet. She wanted to fuck my brains out early on until she realized I've got some self-esteem issues. Now, she only keeps in touch with me when she needs help with her fucking computer.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, yes. We talked about her a few sessions ago. What was her name? Katrina?"}, {"instruction": "Karina.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "There was a two month period during which I didn't hear anything from her. She said it was because she needed to concentrate on her school work, but I suspected otherwise. Then out of the blue, she phones me at work asking me how I had been and, \"Oh, by the way, I'm looking to buy a computer, can you help me out?\" To which I said yes, of course. And then we go out to dinner, and she starts talking about what she had been doing all the time she wasn't calling me. It turns out she had met some guy ten years her senior. They smoked some pot together a few times, and then he banged the hell out of her. I was absolutely broiling with jealousy at that point in the conversation. I had invested more time in Karina than this fucking pot-head, yet he managed to accomplish more with her than I could. After he seemed to want to get more seriously involved with her, she then broke it off. She told me she had been looking for a casual relationship--she had some fun with him and moved on. I mean, what the fuck? This guy she screwed had no difficulty getting a piece of her. Why am I always the one putting in the most time and effort only to end up stroking my own dick?", "input": "", "output": "Do you think she came back to you after all this time because she wants to try to start something again with you romantically?"}, {"instruction": "That's what I had thought at first. But if that was the case, I botched up my chances pretty early on. I blew up at her in the car one day--I screamed at her that I couldn't believe that she would fuck somebody else when I had invested so much time with her. I also told her I felt she only came into my life when she wanted to use me for something. She somehow managed to turn it around and made me feel guilty for yelling. She told me how sad she thought it was that I could be so paranoid and believe that she uses me. Bitch. Goddamn it, I deserved to be with her. I should have been the one that made it to the sack with her, not some geriatric dope fiend she barely knew. And she was so big on her Catholic ways...what a hypocrite. She had been telling me she wasn't going to have sex again until she was married. And there she was getting the high hard one from Joe Marijuana!", "input": "", "output": "Well, it appears she's not willing to commit to any kind of serious relationship at all. Is she really the type of person you're looking for?"}, {"instruction": "No. But I would have liked to have had the opportunity to get closer to her on a physical level. Maybe if I had had that opportunity, we'd be much closer to each other emotionally. And maybe, I did have the opportunity but just didn't see it. As you said, I'm not experienced socially. I have problems picking up signals that other people would find easier to read. But it's not the first time and, considering the mess I've made at work lately, it won't be the last time.", "input": "", "output": "What happened at work?"}, {"instruction": "Whoa! Is that the time? I'm sorry, Charles, I need to get going. I have a hair appointment at 5:15, and I'll be lucky to get across town in time.", "input": "", "output": "Very well. Would you like to schedule your next session today?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. How about two weeks from now?", "input": "", "output": "All right. Take care, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "How are things?"}, {"instruction": "Things are complicated, as usual.", "input": "", "output": "Really? Well, let's start with something you mentioned last time toward the end of our session. You said that you felt you've made some sort of mess at work?"}, {"instruction": "I don't \"feel\" I've made a mess. I know I have.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, to start off, Karina is out of the picture for me. I've decided not to contact her anymore. If she tries to call me, I intend to ignore her. I've realized now that I've wasted too much time with her, and instead of dwelling on what could have been, it's better to just drop it and move on.", "input": "", "output": "It's good to hear such resolve in you. I agree, she didn't seem interested in a serious relationship--certainly not a healthy one."}, {"instruction": "Karina was all about deception. She played games with me, and she did it well. She was using me to make her ex-boyfriend of four years jealous, which is ironic since I'm probably the only male Karina's met in the past seven months whom she hasn't had sex with. She knew I was attracted to her, and the more I became interested and enticed, the more she dangled the chance to be with her sexually just out of reach. She gave me just enough to whet my appetite for her and then pulled way back and said she only wanted to be friends. And then she used my attraction to her as a tool to get things she wanted from me. She's a user and abuser because she's spoiled and gets her way too easily. Well, not this time. I'm through jumping through her fucking hoops.", "input": "", "output": "I think I agree with you on most of your points. Please continue."}, {"instruction": "Well, at about the same time I'd first met Karina, a new woman was hired at the Help Desk to field in-house support problems. Her name is Rachel O'Rielly. Her best friend, Jennifer Keys, helped to get her the job. And I believe, at the time, it had been her intention to fix Rachel and I up.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Jennifer has always liked my sense of humor, and she used to tell me that I reminded her of her best friend. She thought we were very much alike and therefore might be compatible in a relationship.", "input": "", "output": "Have you gotten to know Rachel well? Do you feel she's as compatible as Jennifer suggested?"}, {"instruction": "Initially, I didn't think so, no. But I've come to enjoy her wit and humor. She sits in the cubicle across from me, so we talk often. It's ironic that I usually came to her to discuss my dreary situation with Karina. She had agreed with me that Karina sounded like a user, and that she was all-around bad news. But I have a tendency of drawing situations out, if you hadn't noticed.", "input": "", "output": "You? Draw things out? Never."}, {"instruction": "Thanks for not being too sarcastic.", "input": "", "output": "You're quite welcome."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, as my talks with Rachel increased, I came to realize I was falling for her. Have you ever listened to someone speak and suddenly felt soothing electric sensations gently pulsating through the back of your neck just from the mere sound of her voice? That's the way I feel when I'm around her.", "input": "", "output": "Have you thought about asking Rachel out?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I've fantasized about it. But she works in the same department. It would be more than foolhardy, it would be an occupational suicide. Since Rob left the Help Desk some time ago, I am the only male in the department. And where there's a great number of women together, there is gossip. Could you imagine the whispers shot back and forth if I were to have a relationship with Rachel?", "input": "", "output": "I can see how such a situation would make things uncomfortable."}, {"instruction": "Well, as it turns out, the whispers started anyway. And it's all my fault for being so damn obvious with my feelings toward her.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel they know of your romantic interest in Rachel?"}, {"instruction": "They most definitely do. I'm a very insecure person. Rachel is a very beautiful woman. Guys from other departments have frequently stopped by her cubicle to flirt with her.", "input": "", "output": "And you are jealous."}, {"instruction": "Enraged is more like it. There is one guy in particular--Scott Collavito from the graphic arts department. He has been hounding her for the past month. The guy is a big player. I'd call him an asshole if he didn't give sphincter muscles such a bad name. The guy is a typical Italian stud-monkey with a dark tan, baby-blue eyes, and enough mousse in his thick, black hair to withstand a category five hurricane. He has gold chains dangling from his thick neck--I mean the whole bit. I hate bastards like that--absolutely perfect. The kind of guy that, if you were gay, you'd want to butt-fuck you.", "input": "", "output": "Don't hold back, Tom. Learn to let go of your emotions."}, {"instruction": "More sarcasm, huh? Well, my jealousy was apparently so obvious that the Help Desk gossip queens had already held a half dozen meetings around the water cooler about it. Most of the women in my department don't like the idea of my hooking up with Rachel because they feel I'm too moody. As you already know, I'm notorious for my temper tantrums at work. Rachel is much more in control of her emotions. Last month, I carried the anger a little too far.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if you surf the web at all, but there are a lot of hacker sites on the Internet. You can download just about any application you want to get your hands on for free, if you know where to look. I do. And I also know where to download custom viruses. One particular virus called \"Plunger\" is specially designed to run on an Apple computer running OS 8. It causes the entire system to crash. The victim will see his screen flash multiple colors for about a minute, and then everything on the monitor will start swirling around like water in a toilet bowl. Finally, the poor boob's hard drive gets reformatted, and all his work is lost forever.", "input": "", "output": "I've got a feeling I'm not going to like the rest of this story."}, {"instruction": "You won't. Everyone in the graphic arts department runs a Mac, of course. Well, I found a way to transmit the \"Plunger\" virus through the company's network, directly into Scott Collavito's machine without being detected. I've got a program that ghosts my IP address so no one...", "input": "", "output": "Whoa, hold on there. You lost me."}, {"instruction": "Sorry. Basically, I found a way to send the virus while covering my tracks.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It felt good to do this to Scott. I feel it's my personal responsibility to bring turmoil to the lives of those who have it so easy. A little conflict, a small disaster might build some character. Anyway, the day his system crashed, he naturally called the Help Desk for assistance.", "input": "", "output": "Let me guess--Rachel took the phone call."}, {"instruction": "You got it. I couldn't believe my luck. She had long since known about my jealousy and my affections for her, despite my efforts to suppress them. It didn't take long for her to put it all together. Here I thought I could get away with it. I was patting myself on the back for my ingenuity only to be foiled by a woman's sixth sense.", "input": "", "output": "Did she confront you about crashing Scott's computer?"}, {"instruction": "Not directly, no. She simply stopped talking to me. I let the silent treatment go on for a couple days, praying that I had just been imagining that she'd figured out my juvenile stunt. But I knew. I knew the moment she first turned her head away when I looked over at her that day. I finally sent her an e-mail asking her why she wasn't speaking to me. She immediately replied by asking me how it was possible for one person in a department sharing files on the network drive with a group of twenty people to suddenly contract a virus capable of reformatting their hard drive. Of course, I played on like I had no idea. And this only proved to make things worse.", "input": "", "output": "I can imagine."}, {"instruction": "For the next week, I was miserable. Not being able to speak to Rachel was torture. She's the only person in my department that has kept me sane. I never meant for anyone to know about the virus, especially not her. It was supposed to be a means for me to cope with my jealousy and insecurities. True, it was childish. But it was also satisfying to imagine Scott squirming in his chair. Then guilt just got the best of me, and I couldn't go on pretending like I wasn't responsible.", "input": "", "output": "At least we know your conscience is still intact."}, {"instruction": "I guess so. I finally did what was right. I wrote Rachel a long-winded letter that explained everything. I began the letter describing how I felt about her, then proceeded on about the feelings of jealousy, until finally I confessed to and apologized for crashing Scott's computer.", "input": "", "output": "Did she forward the letter to your manager after you had confessed? I would think this would be a serious violation of SII's security policy."}, {"instruction": "No. She'd never do that. In her mind this wasn't a work-related issue. It was personal.", "input": "", "output": "So what was her reaction to your letter?"}, {"instruction": "I was relieved to receive an e-mail from her saying she was glad I'd admitted to it all. Rachel thought I was a beautiful writer, and that I'd missed my calling. She also made it clear that she was very upset that I'd stoop to such a level. But I couldn't believe she was so willing to forgive me.", "input": "", "output": "It is rather surprising. She must really have valued your friendship to so readily accept your apology. I think that says a lot about Rachel; and maybe something about you, too."}, {"instruction": "She's one very special woman. I just wish we worked in separate departments.", "input": "", "output": "So that you could pursue a relationship with her?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's not like I'd be confident enough to ask her out anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Well, if you do muster the courage, I think you should give yourself some time for this incident to blow over. Speaking of time, ours is about up. I'd like to talk more about your emotions related to this woman. Can you come back next week?"}, {"instruction": "I'd feel more comfortable if we made it two weeks from now.", "input": "", "output": "Very well. I'll see you in two weeks."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Tom. Please have a seat."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "How have things been these past couple of weeks?"}, {"instruction": "Better on some fronts, worse on others.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Let's start with the good news."}, {"instruction": "I've made some progress with Rachel, or maybe I'm just being humored, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "What sort of progress?"}, {"instruction": "I got up the nerve to ask her to lunch.", "input": "", "output": "Great. That's very encouraging news. It must have been very difficult for you to approach her."}, {"instruction": "Well, it wasn't too difficult. I wimped out and asked her via e-mail.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I guess I'm lucky to have gotten that far. I was sitting in my cubicle, only half-minding my Help Desk tickets, when suddenly I found myself opening up a new e-mail message and asking her if she'd like to have lunch with me sometime. And before the more rational side of me was able to catch up and realize what I was doing, the message had already been sent.", "input": "", "output": "Did she accept your invitation? Or is that the bad news?"}, {"instruction": "She accepted. I couldn't believe it. I had expected her to whip back a quick reply with some excuse not to go, but instead she simply asked me where and when. So we picked a time and a place, and there I was, sitting in a booth in a restaurant across from a woman I've wanted to be close to for months.", "input": "", "output": "How did it go?"}, {"instruction": "I felt it was a little strained. I was probably visibly nervous to her. It's ironic how we had joked and flirted with each other over the course of several months, yet once we were alone together, there was this great tension between us. The flow of conversation was a bit choppy. I wish I could have remained in flirt mode when we had gone out to lunch. Maybe then, she'd feel more comfortable hanging around me instead of Mr. Collavito.", "input": "", "output": "That's the gentleman you sent the computer virus to, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. In fact, that subject came up during my conversation with Rachel. She said she didn't understand why I had felt so jealous when Scott already has a girlfriend. Well, if he has a girlfriend, he must be planning to cheat on her.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say that?"}, {"instruction": "Because Scott loves to go over to Rachel's cubicle and talk, and vice versa. They are at each other's cubicle so often each day, that it is driving me insane. How could he not be putting the moves on her? Rachel admitted herself that he was a flirt. But apparently, she's been doing a little flirting of her own. I can't help but think that she's doing it on purpose, just to make me feel frustrated.", "input": "", "output": "Much like Karina had been doing, right?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. All I know is there are times at work--when I'm watching Scott talk to Rachel--when I feel like I'm close to losing control.", "input": "", "output": "Losing control in a violent manner?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. It's the most disturbing feeling to experience: the burning sensation that swells at the base of my skull, that shot of adrenaline that leaves your face flushed with rage. It's all very frightening for me. I truly believe that if things continue between those two like they have, I may lose my temper in ways only Clive Barker could dream up.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think it bothers you so intensely that Scott talks with Rachel often?"}, {"instruction": "Because he can and I can't. And it is particularly disappointing to me that Rachel would rather go to Scott's cubicle to gab than to mine. I feel hurt. I've known her longer than Scott has, yet he gets to spend more time around her now. What the hell am I doing wrong?", "input": "", "output": "Does this sound at all familiar to you?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "I seem to remember you describing a similar situation between you and Karina. You felt that another man--who had known her for a shorter amount of time--had less claim to her attentions than you did."}, {"instruction": "This is totally different.", "input": "", "output": "I'll agree that the circumstances were different. I believe Karina may very well have exploited your affection for her to a degree. But the jealousy factor is clearly similar in both cases. And, of course, such intense emotion is going to distort the reality of the situation. There may very well be a mutual interest between Scott and Rachel that goes beyond friendship, or maybe it's completely innocent. But jealousy will only show you one possibility."}, {"instruction": "I just wish it was me talking to her all the time and Scott getting jealous.", "input": "", "output": "Well, why don't you go over to her cubicle and talk to her?"}, {"instruction": "I've already told you why--I can't talk to her around everybody else in my department. Rumors would start flying.", "input": "", "output": "So what if they conclude that you and Rachel are seeing each other? Isn't that your goal with Rachel after all?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes, but I want to do it discreetly.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that's true. I think you could care less what your co-workers think. You want to be with Rachel, and you want to be able to feel more comfortable talking to her, but you're afraid."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I guess so. I...", "input": "", "output": "Tom? It's okay, Tom. Take a minute. Would you like a tissue?"}, {"instruction": "No, damnit. No, I wouldn't. I want her. But I'm not the type of person that can succeed with someone like Rachel. It's all doomed to failure. I'm doomed to fail. I just want this one fucking good thing to happen in my life, just this once. Goddamnit, Charles! She's so much like me in so many ways, but just different enough that I...I just don't know where it's going to lead. And I can't even muster enough courage to walk up to her and strike up a conversation, unless the whole thing is planned in advance. And even then, it's a chore. If only I could be Scott for a while, maybe I wouldn't have all these fucking problems.", "input": "", "output": "Personally, I feel you have a better shot at winning her affection than Scott does. After all, she did readily accept your lunch invitation."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure she was only being polite. If I ever ask her on a date outside of work, I'm sure she'd turn me down. It seems like the only time I get to go out with women is when they are feeling particularly charitable.", "input": "", "output": "Well, let's put it this way, Tom. If Scott and Rachel speak to each other off and on throughout the day as you suggest, it's likely to be very light, brief conversation, assuming they have normal job functions to attend to. However, Rachel devoted an entire hour solely to you, with no interruptions. Who do you think spent the best quality time with her?"}, {"instruction": "I want more, Charles. I don't just want a conversation. I want emotion and romance. I want to fall in love with her. And I want Rachel to fall for me. I don't want to play games. I don't want to second-guess my actions any longer. I just want to walk into the proverbial sunset with her at my side. And if I have to beat the shit out of Scott to get to that point, then I'll do it.", "input": "", "output": "How will hurting Scott get you any closer to Rachel? If anything, you will have undermined all your progress."}, {"instruction": "I want him out of the picture. I hope the bastard dies, preferably by my own hands.", "input": "", "output": "Tom, you're really starting to concern me with these statements."}, {"instruction": "I'm sick of being derailed by some third fucking party who comes into the picture just to screw my chances, Charles. I want to get even. I want to fight back. I want revenge.", "input": "", "output": "I think we both know you don't want to hurt anybody."}, {"instruction": "We'll see. Fuck this. Session's over, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Tom, come back! We need to..."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Charles!", "input": "", "output": "Tom!"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "You were very angry when we last spoke. I'm hoping you didn't follow through with your threats after you stormed out of my office?"}, {"instruction": "I saw Scott talking to Rachel again. I watched her smile as he spoke and I saw how his eyes were focused on her cleavage. Then he touched her on the arm, and something just snapped.", "input": "", "output": "Oh no."}, {"instruction": "Without thinking, I ran over to Scott's cubicle, cocked my arm way back, and punched him in the jaw. He didn't even see it coming. The smack seemed to echo throughout the floor. Every employee nearby suddenly stopped what they were doing, stood up, and watched the spectacle. Rachel started screaming for me to stop...", "input": "", "output": "Tom, how could you have...?"}, {"instruction": "His legs were really wobbly from the blow, but I didn't stop there. I wouldn't be satisfied until he was on the floor. Pushing Rachel away, I let three more punches slam into his face--a right, a left, another right--until he finally collapsed. Some blood had trickled down onto his shirt, and he just stared up at me all glassy-eyed. I don't think he even knew where he was at that point.", "input": "", "output": "I don't know what to say, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Rachel was still yelling at me: \"How could you? What the hell are you thinking? Why are you doing this? Please stop!\"  Ignoring her, I grabbed Scott by the collar and threw one last punch. When I hit his face, it felt soft and spongy, and my hand seemed to sink into it, which would make sense since it was only the back of my sofa.", "input": "", "output": "Tom, don't scare me like that again."}, {"instruction": "Had you going there for a while, didn't I?", "input": "", "output": "For a while, yes. But had that really happened, I probably would have been informed about it by your superiors or SII security. And I'm sure you would have ended up in jail."}, {"instruction": "Maybe. I'm not sure if you would have found out about it, though. I'm not entirely certain my manager knows that I'm seeing a shrink.", "input": "", "output": "Believe me, I would have found out. Word travels fast. How is the situation between you and Rachel? Any changes?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I haven't asked her to do anything with me since that last lunch I told you about it.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "It's all a waste of time. I'm not going to get anywhere with Rachel. It's all an effort in futility. I might as well get castrated. All the love I'm ever going to get is from my right hand. Sometimes whacking off is better than sex, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "That's not a very healthy outlook."}, {"instruction": "Which is why I'm sitting here, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "You're not giving yourself enough credit, Tom. Whether you like to hear it or not, asking Rachel out to lunch was great progress. Even though you asked her via e-mail, the fact remains that you still asked her. You took a risk despite being afraid. Why stop now? What else are you afraid of?"}, {"instruction": "I'm afraid that I'm going to make more of a fool of myself. And I'm afraid she's going to really get to know me and find out how boring I really am and how I have nothing going for me. Hell, I'm just glad my cat doesn't get out of the house. If she did, she'd find out there are a whole lot better owners than I am. I'll probably come home from work one night and discover that she has packed up her litter box and split. And then I'll find some note stuck on the bottom of the fridge that reads, \"Dear Master: I've found a new person to take care of me. You were such a bore. You never gave me tuna like this guy does. Meows and Purrs....'Claws.' P.S. I left a little memento on your bed for you to remember me by!\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "My cat's new master will probably end up being fucking Scott Collavito--he'd succeed in taking two pussies away from me.", "input": "", "output": "You really are bitter over that man. Why do you think you are so jealous of him in particular?"}, {"instruction": "Because I've seen his type before. He's a frat boy, a guy born with a \"get through life free\" card in his mouth. It sickens me how easy it is for people like him to get just about anything they desire in life.", "input": "", "output": "Why is it sickening?"}, {"instruction": "Why do you think? I've been through a lot of pain and disappointment through the years. Whatever small achievements I have made were a struggle for me. I worked hard to be Rachel's friend. I spent a lot of time making her like me. Then, suddenly, Scott came out of nowhere and, in a couple month's time, became someone she feels ten times more comfortable talking to. Where's the justice in that?", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps Rachel feels more comfortable talking to him, but perhaps not. If she does, why do you think that is?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "She clearly knows you're interested in her romantically, and your jealous responses have certainly left an impression on her. But she forgave you for what you did to Scott, and that shows she still values your friendship."}, {"instruction": "But I want more from Rachel. I want to be involved with her. I want to be the one that makes her truly happy. And I want her to love me back.", "input": "", "output": "Those types of feelings take time to develop, Tom. What reasons have you given Rachel to care about you that deeply?"}, {"instruction": "None. I've been too busy being bitter and angry and shooting off computer viruses to people she talks to.", "input": "", "output": "So how do you get her to feel differently about you?"}, {"instruction": "What am I, fucking Silly Putty? You press me against your words and expect me to spew them back at you? I don't fucking know, Charles. If I knew how to make her feel the way I want her to feel, then I wouldn't be having any problems, now would I?", "input": "", "output": "Well, do you think that giving up asking her out is going to help your chances?"}, {"instruction": "Of course not. But I've seen this pattern before. Boy meets girl. Boy asks girl out. Boy and girl become lovers. Girl yawns a lot. Girl meets new boy. Girl chews on old boy's heart. Old boy discovers beer...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's not worth it. I'm just going to get knocked on my ass again.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe, and maybe not. If you think that way going into a situation, you certainly aren't going to improve your chances. But if it doesn't work out with Rachel, there are many other women out there who may be compatible with you."}, {"instruction": "Sure. Plenty of fish in the fucking sea, right? Except whenever I jump into the water, the fish suddenly scatter and vanish.", "input": "", "output": "At least you'd be getting into the water. Not long ago, you wouldn't even consider nearing the shore."}, {"instruction": "Whatever. A couple of people at work are trying to push me into proceeding with Rachel. There's another co-worker, Gina Cartwright, who's getting married this weekend. Rachel's going to the wedding, and so am I. Gina talked me into going, and now she wants me to try to hang out with Rachel while I'm there. If I show up, that is. We both know what happened the last time that I accepted a wedding invitation.", "input": "", "output": "Yes. You circled around the church several times, afraid to go inside because of all the strangers there."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, I'm not looking forward to Gina's wedding any more than I did Cherie's. I'm going to be nervous, agitated, and hopefully very drunk. Somehow at the reception, I figure I'll be in a corner somewhere, quietly downing beers and wishing I were home.", "input": "", "output": "Tom, you should go to this wedding. I think it's very important that you attempt to socialize. You will be nervous, true, but it will be a valuable social experience."}, {"instruction": "I think I'll only go because I know Rachel will be there. It's funny. Deep down, I hope I get to hook up with her. But with my luck, she'll end up finding some dashing single guy at the reception.", "input": "", "output": "Stay positive, Tom. You may be pleasantly surprised."}, {"instruction": "All right. I positively believe I'm going to have a miserable time this weekend.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Well, our time is about up. How would you like to schedule our next session?"}, {"instruction": "The two week thing seems to be working for me.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you in two weeks then. Goodbye, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Last time you were here, you were anxious over an upcoming wedding reception you had been invited to attend. I believe Rachel was to be there as well?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "How did it go?"}, {"instruction": "From a social standpoint, I guess it went better than the last wedding I attempted to attend. I actually entered the premises this time, after all. But from a \"Rachel\" standpoint, it was a disaster.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "When I got to the reception hall, I parked in the lot and tried to muster up enough courage to open up the car door and walk in. There were a lot of people there, virtually all of whom I had never met in my life, so it was very difficult for me. I broke out in a light sweat, and my heart started thumping hard. I actually felt myself being pushed back and forth in my seat each time my heart pumped a beat. The reception was to start at eight, but I remained in my car for about forty minutes past that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Were you sitting in the car and watching people arrive at the wedding?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it made things worse for me. I didn't see one person enter that building alone. Everyone but me seemed to be accompanied by someone else. It made me feel even more self-conscious. As usual, I wanted to put my key back in the ignition and drive off, but I didn't. I finally decided to step out of the car and walk towards the entrance.", "input": "", "output": "How did you finally gain the courage?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I think it was out of anger. I was angry at myself for being such a wimp about it. Besides, I knew that once I made it inside, I'd be rewarded with a full, open bar. As soon as I entered the reception hall, I proceeded to the ballroom and stood in line to get beer. There were so many people. I briefly scanned around the room, and it was filled with complete strangers. I really felt panicked at that point. I couldn't even find Gina or her husband, the bride and groom. So I grabbed my beer and went back outside.", "input": "", "output": "Was that the end of it?"}, {"instruction": "No. I figured if I downed a couple beers fast, I'd be able to loosen up enough to remain inside the hall without passing out. So I swallowed the first beer in about two giant gulps and returned to the bar, got a second beer and did the same thing.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What happened next?"}, {"instruction": "Well, after a few moments, Gina and her husband, Brent, appeared along with the bridesmaids, the best man, and the maid of honor. The DJ handed the best man a microphone, and he gave his speech. It was the usual \"wish you all the best\" drivel that's said at most receptions. Then the maid of honor, Gina's sister, spoke about their life growing up and how happy she was to see her big sister get married to a wonderful guy and so forth. It was a bit more emotional than I'm describing, but maybe it was just the buzz I had at the time that made me think it was. Anyway, the couple then proceeded to cut the cake, and it was about at that point that I saw Rachel.", "input": "", "output": "She had just shown up?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And when I saw her, my heart felt like it had fallen out of my chest and had been carved up by the cake knife--Rachel walked in arm-in-arm with a guy I'd never seen before. It was clear that he was her date for the night. I was crushed.", "input": "", "output": "Did you approach her?"}, {"instruction": "No. I didn't talk to her. We made eye contact when she entered the ballroom. But when a girl has got a guy next to her, it's nature's way of saying, \"Leave me alone, creep.\" So that's what I did. I left her alone and went to get more beer.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you feel very dependent on alcohol?"}, {"instruction": "I just knew I wasn't going to enjoy myself. About fifteen minutes later, Jennifer Keys showed up with her husband. I felt a lot more comfortable that there was finally someone else I knew and could hang out with. So the three of us sort of gravitated around the dance floor, watching people gyrate around. Rachel and her date got out on the floor a few times, and it made me sick to my stomach. What a bitch. It's like she only brought this guy along to get me upset. Well, it worked.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure it had nothing to do with you, Tom. Did you meet any new people there?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. Mostly, I spent the night talking to Jennifer and Frank, her husband. But I did get a chance to chat briefly with Gina and to congratulate her and Brent. That was about when Jennifer tugged at my shirt to point out some really cute, petite blond who she claimed had been eyeing me.", "input": "", "output": "So you met a someone there. Good."}, {"instruction": "I didn't meet her exactly. We shared a few moments of mutual interest. Basically, I didn't have the guts to approach her or to talk to her. We spent the night sort of brushing up against each other \"accidentally.\" And I watched her dance with her friends for a while. Jennifer kept urging me on, trying to get me to ask her to dance, but of course we're talking about Tom \"No-Balls\" Darden here. It was funny, really. The girl would actually go out of her way to come near me and then pretend like she was paying attention to something else. She'd lightly brush her arm against mine or back up into me, as if to provoke a response. I just ignored it and continued to nurse my beer.", "input": "", "output": "Tom, it really sounds like you had a great opportunity to break down some of those social barriers."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I did. But I'm just not outgoing enough to initiate things like that. Oh, the memories I would have now if only I could have taken that extra step, Charles. I wish I were more like my cousin.", "input": "", "output": "Your cousin?"}, {"instruction": "Lance. He's a year younger than I am and is the biggest lady's man I've ever met--I mean absolutely no one short of a porn star has had more conquests than him. His exploits are legendary. He's everything I wish I could be. Confidence pours out of him like a fucking waterfall. And, of course, that's not all that's pouring out.", "input": "", "output": "Having a lot of sexual conquests is not necessarily something to be proud of, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Maybe not, but his ability to manipulate women is so amazing to me. I don't agree with the manipulation, but I do envy the ease at which he can be around the opposite sex. He just got out of the Navy after serving four years. He was stationed in Japan. I met him this last weekend, and we went out to Centerfold's near my apartment. I guess that was an appropriate setting. That whole night, Lance talked about all the women he had in places like Thailand and Indonesia and other countries he doesn't even remember. Many of the girls were hookers, but many more were just women he met in bars. He's literally had hundreds of women. He had sex with twins at the same time. He's done tag teams with his Navy buddies, and he's been involved in wild sex orgies. But, of course, what other kind of orgies are there? It's not like you can have a boring sex orgy, right? Hell, Lance even fucked one of Julia Roberts' nieces, for Christ's sake. He met her during some cruise he was on to celebrate his high school graduation. The whole time he was on that boat, the girl had her Dad wire her money to pay for the $1,000 drinking tab he and his buddy had rung up there in five days. Lance must be some hell of a good lay. It can't be because he's hung well--I've seen the boy naked, and he's pretty average. But he's got something about him that drives women absolutely wild.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "The guy is unbelievable. I told him that we should seriously consider getting a book published about his exploits. I'd be the ghostwriter, of course. We could title it, \"Techniques on Getting Laid as Taught by the Master.\" And maybe I'd pick up a few pointers along the way. At least I would be doing something constructive with my journalism degree instead of languishing in the Help Desk department at SII.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you aren't seriously considering focusing your life on achieving the same sexual notoriety your cousin apparently has."}, {"instruction": "Notoriety? I guess you could call it that. At times, when I really think about it, I actually feel a little sorry for Lance.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "It just seems like he's never been in a stable relationship. He just sleeps around and sleeps around. I told him he should try to settle down, but he said that getting a fresh piece of ass is just too exciting to abandon.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think he's ever been in love?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when he was younger, Lance was involved with a girl for a couple of years. I think he really did fall for her. But she broke his heart. She had been cheating on him with a Marine, whom she eventually married. He was devastated when he found out, of course. I don't think Lance has looked at women the same way since. It's like he's been exacting revenge on women.", "input": "", "output": "That's a shame."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. But then again, it's every guy's dream to have the kind of sexual experiences Lance has had. It's a trade-off, I guess. You can either settle down and be in love, or you can be a womanizer. Or you can be me.", "input": "", "output": "And what are you?"}, {"instruction": "Someone so fearful and distrustful of people that it's sabotaged my ability to make friends or to have relationships with women. All I really want is a best friend who happens to be a woman with whom I happen to be in love with. But I end up scaring women away with the things I do. I seem to have this overall knack to repel women I'm attracted to, like Rachel. It's like I'm a magnet and so is Rachel--when I try to get close to her, I end up pushing her away. She's really uncomfortable around me. I think I frighten her sometimes, especially with my jealousy. It hurts that she feels that way. It's all so very unfair. When a woman is being pursued by a physically attractive man, it's considered appropriate. But if someone like me pursues the same woman, it's classified as stalking. I really wish I hadn't botched things up so badly with Rachel. Jennifer really tried to set the two of us up by getting her hired at SII. She says we are so much alike. So it's like I messed up a sure thing.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that's true. Just because Jennifer believes the two of you are alike, it doesn't mean you actually are. I'm sure there's a great deal about Rachel that Jennifer isn't aware of, despite being her best friend. I definitely don't believe it was a sure thing. You're being much too hard on yourself, Tom. Nothing in life is certain."}, {"instruction": "I just need a lesson on how to make women want me like they do Lance. It seems like the more I want women to be around me, the more I scare them away.", "input": "", "output": "I believe we need to work harder on your people skills in general, before we can begin to focus on romantic relationships. Usually, the two skills work hand-in-hand."}, {"instruction": "I know.", "input": "", "output": "Let's discuss this further in our next session."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you again in two weeks. Take care, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Hold on a second, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Oh, you're on the phone. Sorry.", "input": "", "output": "Sorry about that, Tom. Please have a seat."}, {"instruction": "No problem. I think I ran a little early.", "input": "", "output": "How have you been?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I've had better weeks...well, at least that's what I'm told.  I can't seem to remember back that far.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Anything specific that's troubling you?"}, {"instruction": "It's just that I'll never be more than a co-worker to Rachel and I'll be forced to watch helplessly as other men in my department vie for her womb.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What I find interesting, Tom, is that I've come to believe you aren't as jealous of the other men who flirt with Rachel as you are jealous of Rachel herself."}, {"instruction": "What is that supposed to mean?", "input": "", "output": "I think you're jealous of Rachel's infectious charm and her ability to easily socialize and make friends."}, {"instruction": "That's a load of crap. I'm upset that these fucking \"pretty boys\" are all over her like she's wrapped in vagina-scented fly paper. Last week, I saw her in the lobby entrance with two guys who looked like they'd just stepped out of a GQ magazine. She ended up going to lunch with them.", "input": "", "output": "So?"}, {"instruction": "Players! All of them. Do you think they give a damn what type of person Rachel is or that she has feelings or hopes or fears? No, they're just looking to get laid. Those two guys had probably placed a bet to see which one would get in the sack with her first. Or maybe, they'll end up doing a train on her. Then they'll be deciding who gets to be the caboose vs. the \"little engine that could.\"", "input": "", "output": "Say what you will, Tom, but the fact remains that you wish you could make friends with the same ease Rachel can. It eats away at you. When you told me about your cousin from the Navy, you were overtly jealous of his sexual experiences and the ease at which he could attract and pick up women."}, {"instruction": "I'm not jealous of my cousin.", "input": "", "output": "You are. Your frustration with your own inability to socialize has made you bitter at those who don't have that problem."}, {"instruction": "Why are you telling me this? What difference does it make who I'm jealous of?", "input": "", "output": "It's important that you recognize the source of your frustration. You are too focused on what others are doing, when you should be paying attention to what Tom Darden is doing."}, {"instruction": "I know all too well what Tom Darden is doing--nothing. Fucking zero. He sits at home every night by himself and drinks beer and wishes that he'd just pass out and never wake again. There's no changing me, I've come to realize that now. I've been like this ever since I can remember. I've always been afraid of people, afraid of rejection, afraid of failure.", "input": "", "output": "And afraid of success."}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "I find that you seem to be more fearful of success than anything else. That's why you don't take risks. You don't try to stand out. You're afraid that if you do take a chance, and happen to succeed, that success will only be temporary. Because it will put you in the spotlight and soon people will discover what a real failure you are, making your rejection that much more intense."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's about time you finally saw me for what I really am: a failure.", "input": "", "output": "No, I don't believe you're a failure, Tom. I'm simply interpreting how you feel about yourself. And it's self-defeating to think that way."}, {"instruction": "You don't get it, do you Charles? I'm not someone you can apply your stupid psycho-labels on. You may have helped a lot of people with similar problems, but I know I'm different. There's no helping me. I've been to see you how many times now? Twenty five? Thirty? And where have I gotten?", "input": "", "output": "I feel you've made a great deal of progress, actually."}, {"instruction": "Bullshit. You'd say anything to justify having me stick around to help pay for your next vacation. I know people who've spent years in therapy. Years! And they've gotten nowhere. You'd think they'd had realized that after the first year.", "input": "", "output": "The pace of therapy is usually determined by the patient's willingness to be helped."}, {"instruction": "Well, then I guess it's going to be a long while before I change.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps, perhaps not.  It's completely up to you."}, {"instruction": "Look, I don't mean to sound like I don't want your help, it's just that I'm very frustrated. I've been coming to see you for a while now, and I don't seem to be getting anywhere. I know I've got to put in a lot of effort myself, but I just don't know where to begin.", "input": "", "output": "Have you tried getting out of the house and going out more?"}, {"instruction": "There aren't a lot of places for a single guy to go that would make him feel comfortable being alone, Charles. In an age when everyone seems to be encouraged to embrace their individuality and independence, it's ironic that single people are treated like pariahs. Have you ever gone to a nice restaurant alone, Charles? Have you ever caught the stares and heard the whispers of people seated near you? Have you ever gone to a movie theater alone, waiting in line, looking at the couples all around you, holding hands, kissing each other, almost as if to highlight the fact that you're with no one? The world has no place for singles. Hell, even the government treats us like second-class citizens. Married couples get far more tax breaks than I'll ever see. The discrimination never ends.", "input": "", "output": "By the way, it's not true that there is a tax break for married couples.  In fact, it's quite the opposite--there's a penalty. But to get back to your point, I am single and I've gone to the movies, and restaurants, and done other activities as a single individual. But I never notice any sort of discrimination based on my single status. As we've discussed before, it's all about perception, Tom. If you view the world through a filter of paranoia, you're bound to notice things that you can use to justify your own insecurity. I understand that it's difficult for you to socialize and be around people. And I'm sure that anxiety foments your paranoia and self-consciousness. But venturing out into the social world is a risk you must take if you're ever going to overcome your fear. Your problems are not going to be solved by staying home, drinking beer, and playing with your cat."}, {"instruction": "Amazing. You're the third person to say that to me. A couple of my co-workers--Gina and Jennifer--said that to me when I was complaining about my love life.", "input": "", "output": "Well, maybe you should take it to heart. They obviously recognized what you're doing to yourself and were honest enough to tell you how they felt about it. Think of your problem as you would think about a fear of heights, for instance. You would never be able to overcome your fear of heights if you don't try to climb. Every time you think of your fear of social situations, just substitute it for fear of heights.  You'll be amazed at what you might uncover that way."}, {"instruction": "I guess so. It's just so hard to get out of my routine. I wake up, go to work, come home, hop on the computer, whack off, watch some TV, and go to sleep. In fact, when I get really bored on the weekends, I spend a lot of time whacking off. I figure if I'm going to spend all my time alone, I might as well make myself feel good.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I can't believe I'm telling you this. How many guys do you talk to who openly admit to beating their meat?", "input": "", "output": "More than you'd think. There's nothing wrong with talking about masturbation with your therapist."}, {"instruction": "I didn't even start pounding my pud until I was around seventeen years old. People at school joked about whacking off, and I had no idea what they were talking about. My first orgasm came by accident, no pun intended. I was in bed on my stomach and just starting thrusting into my mattress, then pow! It was like I'd discovered gold or something. For the next few weeks, I think I was masturbating so many times I almost tore the damn thing off. I've been whacking off at least twice a week ever since. Though recently, it's been a lot more often.", "input": "", "output": "How much more?"}, {"instruction": "About five to six times a week--once a day, keeps the...never mind. I start thinking about my lack of love life and how I'll never find another woman who will want to be with me ever again, and it just depresses the hell out of me. What the hell, life sucks so I might as well whack, right? Then I'll start fantasizing about women I've known and jerk off, even if in real life I'd never even think about having sex with them.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's funny.", "input": "", "output": "What is?"}, {"instruction": "I just realized that I've never really fantasized about Rachel sexually. Don't get me wrong, I do fantasize about her, but my fantasies have always involved how we'd interact as a couple.", "input": "", "output": "When do you usually have these sort of fantasies?"}, {"instruction": "In bed. I know, I know. But it's not like that. My thoughts of her are always very emotional and tender. Sometimes, it makes it easier for me to fall asleep if I place a pillow lengthwise along one side of my chest and wrap my arms around it, imagining that I'm holding Rachel. I'll whisper to it occasionally and kiss it. I'll say to the pillow, \"I love you\" and hold it tighter until for a while, I actually start believing the fantasy. Then I drift to sleep.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "While in college, I had a psychology textbook that talked about a study done on a young chimpanzee. The researchers placed the chimp in a sort of solitary confinement for a few weeks. The chimp was noticeably agitated from the lack of interaction. Finally, the researchers placed a mock chimp made of wire and covered over with carpeting into the cage. The baby chimp immediately started clinging to it as if it were holding its mother. It was really rather pathetic and sad. I remember bursting into tears when I first read about this. The doctors were attempting to prove the psychological need for human interaction and affection. When I hold my pillow at night in the way I described, I sometimes think about that poor baby chimp and how much we have in common.", "input": "", "output": "I know it's difficult being alone when all you want is companionship, Tom. But you've got to start making a reasonable effort to participate in more people-oriented activities. Otherwise..."}, {"instruction": "It's so damn hard to do, Charles. I have very few friends I can hang out with. No one misses me when I'm not around. I don't matter to anyone. So there's not a lot of incentive to be outside my apartment.", "input": "", "output": "What I suggest is that we work on a little project together."}, {"instruction": "Project? What type of project? Does it involve construction paper and paste? A paper doll, perhaps?", "input": "", "output": "No. In order to overcome your uneasiness socializing, I recommend you build a pyramid of socially-related activities, beginning with some simple and more comfortable ones all the way to the most feared and difficult for you to accomplish. Then, at the top of the pyramid, I want you to create your ultimate social goal. It will be whatever you feel is the most appropriate for you. Once you have the pyramid laid out, draw it out on a piece of paper and bring it in with you next time so we can go over it."}, {"instruction": "You can't be serious.", "input": "", "output": "You know I am."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and it scares the hell out of me. All right, I'll humor you. But don't expect any earth-shattering revelations next week.", "input": "", "output": "I'll leave it in your hands, Tom."}, {"instruction": "All right. But I warned you.", "input": "", "output": "See you in two weeks?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. At least I think it's okay.", "input": "", "output": "It will be. Take care, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Let's see.  I believe you owe me a homework assignment."}, {"instruction": "Right here.", "input": "", "output": "Ah. Thank you."}, {"instruction": "I know you said to draw it by hand, but I figured I might as well do it in Paintshop Pro and print it out rather than have you attempt to decipher my crappy handwriting.", "input": "", "output": "I appreciate that. Let's go over what you have listed here. I see Rachel's name twice on this paper. At the bottom of your pyramid, you write that you'd like to ask her to lunch. Haven't you already done this?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but I asked her via e-mail. E-mail is a cop-out, really. Everybody is brave when they only have to stare back at a computer monitor. It's too impersonal. I want to have the courage to get up, walk over to Rachel's desk, and ask her to lunch verbally. The idea of doing so makes me very uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that is?"}, {"instruction": "I think it's mostly because I'm afraid that my nearby co-workers will overhear me. I don't want to have them snickering or making me feel embarrassed. They're all female; it's easy for me to imagine them immediately gossiping back and forth about me after that.", "input": "", "output": "You don't particularly trust the co-workers in your department, I take it."}, {"instruction": "Absolutely not. I constantly hear them sharing with each other the personal lives of other employees. Lately, they've been delighting over the sexual appetite of one of the women in the programming department. It's something about her being involved in S&M. I even hear that she had invited a few male co-workers over to her house for an S&M party.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "The Help Desk confers with the programmers almost on a daily basis, so I talk to this woman fairly regularly. You'd never guess she was ever into something like that. She seems very pleasant over the phone. But it's hard to decipher what the truth is about people in our company anymore. And that's why I try not to broadcast the fact that I adore Rachel so much, even though I think it's pretty obvious to everyone by now. I don't want to be the next focal point of their gossip sessions.", "input": "", "output": "Suppose you managed to get involved in a relationship with Rachel, how would you handle your co-workers then?"}, {"instruction": "If I ever manage to get to that point, it won't matter what they say. I would care less.", "input": "", "output": "So why should you care now?"}, {"instruction": "Because they have the power to sabotage my chances with Rachel. They can try to talk her out of dating me.", "input": "", "output": "Why would they want to do that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. But I feel they may take it upon themselves to impose their views on Rachel and distort her perception of me.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you're giving your co-workers enough credit."}, {"instruction": "Maybe not. But that's how I feel--distrustful to the end.", "input": "", "output": "Besides, if you're in a relationship, there's more to gossip about. It's to their advantage to have you go out with Rachel."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you can ask Rachel out?"}, {"instruction": "In time, I think I will muster the courage, but I'm afraid of making her feel cornered and I don't want her to turn me down. And then she brought that guy to Gina's wedding, she may still be seeing him. I think he may work for SII--he had that familiar look. In any case, I'm really fearful of having all my hopes dashed should she say no. But I guess I'll never know her answer until I'll ask, right?", "input": "", "output": "That's right."}, {"instruction": "We'll see.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, let's move on. Test-driving a car is a social goal of yours? Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I just feel that an encounter with a car salesman is one of the most aggravating social experiences anyone has to endure. I'm too passive in situations that require me to control the flow of conversation or risk having some fast-talking hoodlum convince me to spend twenty-thousand dollars on a Volkswagian throwback to an era that only an aging hippie wannabe could appreciate.", "input": "", "output": "So you want to work on being more assertive when dealing with salespeople?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I feel that if I can learn to handle them, it will give me more confidence overall and that will carry over into other social scenarios. It's hard to be firm with people without sounding rude. I've had Jehovah's Witnesses knock on my door, and I've ended up letting them go through their whole speech without telling them I'm not interested. What I'd really like to do is cut them off before they can get more than two words out, tell them I worship Satan, and tell them to fuck off or I'll toss chicken blood on their shoes.", "input": "", "output": "I agree that it's important to be firm sometimes, but usually it must be done with discretion. You can interrupt them by politely thanking them for stopping by and telling them that you're not interested."}, {"instruction": "I know. But I feel guilty for doing that.", "input": "", "output": "Making you feel guilty is often part of a salesperson's job. Keep that in mind. What else do we have on this list? Hmm, this is a bit strange. Why do you want to pick up a prostitute?"}, {"instruction": "I think I put that on there as a joke. I haven't been laid in over two years. Jesus! Two years. I can't believe it's been that long! Lately, I've been feeling like I'll never have sex again. It's horrifying to watch my youthful appearance slowly disappear, ever decreasing my chances of attracting a woman. Every morning, it seems I find a new line in my face or there's an extra gray hair on my head. It's so unfair that I don't have any sexual frame of reference other than my relationship with Sharon. Sometimes I think about prostitution as a viable alternative to loneliness. But I think it's just one of those things you fantasize about but would never really follow through with in real life. I guess that's why I put in on the list--deep down, I'd like to go through with it and experience something not many people have.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I like your first answer better--that you put it on the list as a joke. I'd rather you didn't seriously consider seeking the services of a prostitute."}, {"instruction": "\"Seeking the services\"--you make it sound so sanitary, Charles. You should be Hugh Grant's agent.", "input": "", "output": "Well..let's look at what you put at the top of the pyramid: you'd like to flirt with a woman and ask for her phone number; and you'd like to show up at a party. Do you consider these activities to be the most socially challenging for you?"}, {"instruction": "Aside from public speaking, I could think of nothing else that would make me more uncomfortable.

It can be frustrating not seeing results immediately, but many of the antidepressants take at least three to five weeks before you notice any results. You have to give the medication time to build up in your system. I'd like to prescribe another drug.

Two weeks ago, you were frustrated with me because you felt as though we'd made little progress. I told you that progress was directly related to your willingness to be helped. You have to allow yourself to be open to suggestion, lest you wallow in your depression indefinitely.

In what way are they intense?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. They just seem to be more vivid and frequent.

For example, the one I had a couple nights ago is still fresh in my brain.", "input": "", "output": "What happened in that dream?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it started off with me standing in my apartment, painting a wall. The paint was a really bright, fluorescent, and truly horrid shade of green. There was a section of the wall above me that was just out of my reach. I jumped a couple times trying to get to it with the roller in one hand, but I was still missing the section by inches. Then I started to hear this incessant giggling coming from behind me, as if someone found my attempts amusing.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know who it was?"}, {"instruction": "I turned around and realized that it was my cat, only she wasn't really a cat at all. She seemed to be a grotesque, polymorphed creature--half cat and half woman. The lower half of her body was completely that of a human with a black mini-skirt and shapely legs wrapped tightly in black fishnet stockings. The top half of her body was almost completely feline with fur-covered arms protruding out of a snugly-fit camisole. Her hands were slightly clawed, and her head was exactly like that of my cat, except that it was human's size. As she snickered at me, she crossed one leg over the other and slightly bounced the calf up and down, showing off her stiletto high-heels.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Sounds unusual for a cat."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  This was definitely not your average pussy. Anyway, I was immediately startled as she began speaking in a raspy, whisper-like voice--something a snake might sound like if it could talk. \"Why deny yourself the right to fly?\" she asked. I looked at her with a puzzled expression, then turned to look back at the unpainted section of the wall. As I stared at it, it seemed to draw closer to me until I could easily reach it with my paint roller. I realized that I had somehow floated toward the ceiling. I could fly! Once I completed painting that section, the wall began to resonate with a soft humming drone, and the paint pulsated with an eerie glow. Then the wall suddenly disappeared, revealing downtown San Francisco outside. \"You are finally free,\" my cat whispered, absently licking the fur on her wrist. I stepped out onto what appeared to be a ledge and, with some encouraging words from my cat, I leapt off the building. At first, I began to fall to the ground, but after a few moments of concentration, I was flying once again. I never felt more happy than at that moment. I truly had all the sensations of flight in that dream. I could feel the wind pushing my hair back. I could feel myself become weightless. People below became tiny, indiscernible dots. There I was gliding over buildings, swooping underneath the Golden Gate Bridge, and looping back around toward Golden Gate Park. And then I was over the SII building campus.", "input": "", "output": "What was going through your mind as you were flying?"}, {"instruction": "Well, once I got over the initial feelings of euphoria, I started thinking about Rachel. I imagined how she'd react if she were to see me flying. I soon became convinced that if I could show her this skill, she'd instantly realize how special and necessary I was to her. So I shifted course toward Rachel's apartment building. Once I landed, I ran excitedly inside and hopped on the first available elevator.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't fly up the elevator shaft?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, no. When I got to her floor, I ran to her front door and banged on it several times. Rachel opened the door, dressed in only her bra and panties. Six men I've never seen before suddenly rushed out from behind her, all of them in different stages of undress. They smiled at me as they passed, disappearing down the hallway. I looked back at Rachel and noticed that she had droplets of semen staining her face and stomach.", "input": "", "output": "And you felt...?"}, {"instruction": "I am...was dumbfounded. It was as if I was going through an emotional overload. I could feel hate, jealousy, sadness, anger, betrayal, and anguish all at once. She continued to stare at me as if nothing were out of the ordinary. \"Well?\" she asked, waiting for me to speak. \"I know how to fly,\" I muttered, my eyes focused on the floor. Rachel brightened, took my hand in hers, and lead me back to the elevator. When we both got on the elevator, she hit a button, and we were whisked to the roof of the building. As we stepped out, she said, \"Prove it to me.\" But when I stepped onto the ledge, I was terrified. I no longer believed that I had the ability to fly; it's not possible for a human being to be like a bird. I thought about getting back on the elevator, but it was too late. I felt Rachel's hand push hard against my back, and I tumbled off the building end over end, the street rushing up to greet me. When I crashed to the ground defeated, I began to cry. As I was laying there on my back, I began to feel hands rubbing me gently over my pants. At first, I thought it was just bystanders checking to see if I was still alive, but then I realized I was being felt up. I started to relax. The hands slowly unzipped my fly and reached for my dick. Pretty soon, I became quite aroused as I felt someone performing fellatio on me. I began fantasizing about Rachel--how much I want to run my hands through her hair and draw her close to me; how I want to feel her breasts and put my mouth over her nipples. And then I realized I was about to come. When I lifted my head to look down at her, my cat was staring back at me from my crotch, smiling. That's when I suddenly woke up.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was not a very happy ending, unless you're into sex with polymorphed house pets.", "input": "", "output": "I suppose not."}, {"instruction": "So what do you think about the dream?

I'm not a Jungian in that respect.  But generally speaking, the dream seems to reflect a great deal of insecurity, jealousy, and frustration you've expressed with both your social inadequacies and your love life.

This weekend was destined to be full of booze, and no piddling little fear of negative drug interactions was going to stop me from drinking. I'm so sick of being alone. Hell, I'm sick of saying that I'm sick of being alone. I cried and drank all weekend because I don't understand what's wrong with me and why there seems to be no one on this planet as socially inept as I am. I actually tried to magnify my pain this weekend. I popped in my copy of \"Leaving Las Vegas\" into the VCR, quite possibly the most depressing movie ever made. Have you ever seen it?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I have. It's certainly not what one would describe as an uplifting film."}, {"instruction": "Definitely not. Well, as I was drinking my beer, I played the movie up to the scene in which Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue were in the hotel room for the first time together. As a prostitute, she was just interested in turning the trick and getting out of there when the meter ran out. But Nicholas Cage's character told her that he didn't care about the sex. \"There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. Just stay. That's what I want. I want you to talk or listen, but just stay,\" he pleaded with her.

The movie has profound meaning to me. I know precisely how the character feels. And it's not like the movie's totally fiction, either.

Fuck no. Those bastards went on to make millions off the author's anguish. Fucking, fucking leeches! God damn them all! That's the reality of this fucking planet, Charles. That's what life is all about--exploitation, competition, selfishness. We are all selfish fucking creatures, all six billion of us. No one gives a shit. Even Mother Theresa had motives. Don't think for a second otherwise. So do you, Charles, for that matter. You hide behind the medical shield claiming to help people, but it's a pretty fucking lucrative job for you, isn't it?

I haven't been able to get her off my mind in months. But I'm afraid she's going to end up being just another woman I was never able to got close to. I've been thinking a lot about the dreams I've been having of her lately. Almost all of them entail some sort of sexual encounter she had with other men.

There are all those people, who mostly come in pairs, drinking and enjoying themselves, watching you walk in alone...and I begin to wonder how many people in that smoky room realize what a loser I am for coming into that sort of place, getting liquored up only to go home alone. I stumbled into a Waffle House on my way from that bar. What I saw there scared the hell out of me. There was a bunch of old men, all lined up at the counter, quietly eating their greasy breakfast and drinking black, diluted coffee. Every one of them wore a really solemn, worn face. And you could tell through their eyes that they'd given up on life many years ago. A few of the men returned my gaze, and as our eyes met, there was an immediate sense of understanding.

I've always struggled through life trying to figure out what purpose I have, what point there is for my being here. And now, for the first time ever, I feel I have a sense of understanding.

I feel pressure at the base of my skull, along with sharp, tingling sensations down my neck. And then...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Something truly extraordinary happens.

Something will be happening in the dream that's very benign. And then something someone says will somehow--and quite suddenly--trigger this intense feeling of fear. Like one time, a guy in my dream said to me, \"Tom, I'm going to the grocery store. Do you want anything?\" And immediately, I was struck with fear by what he said.

I remember waking up from a terrible nightmare and looking around the room, thankful that I was awake. Only I wasn't awake at all. Just as I realized that, I suddenly heard a deep, demonic laugh slowly echoing from an unseen being in the room. And then I suddenly felt the dramatic feeling of fear that culminated in a cacophony of jumbled voices and the physical symptoms I've described earlier. Finally, I awoke--for real this time. And when I looked around the room, it looked exactly like it did when I thought I had awakened from the nightmare the first time. Everything was the same: the clock radio was in the same position on my nightstand, the blinds were opened the same way...everything was just as it was. It was as if my eyes had been opened during my nightmare and I had actually seen my true surroundings.", "input": "", "output": "It's very possible that you did have your eyes open but were still dreaming. Sleepwalkers have been known to do it. They can have conversations with people who are awake and walk about as if they were fully conscious, but they usually have no recollection of having done so."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, I just think that these voices truly mean something, like they are more than just a product of night terrors. Every single time I have one of these episodes, I consistently hear the voices. They are always there, despite the fact that the subject matter of the nightmares themselves have absolutely nothing to do with one another. The voices are the only constant. So when I start to hear the voices and then wake up from my nightmare, I immediately try to get back to sleep to return to the voices.", "input": "", "output": "Are you ever successful?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but I can only hear them for a few seconds. And sometimes, I manage to reproduce the physical response to a nightmare even when I'm fully awake.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know how the hell that's possible, but I can do it. I just can't seem to recall the voices at will.", "input": "", "output": "When you say that you feel these voices are more than mere products of your night terrors, what exactly do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know how to describe it to you without sounding religious. Believe me, I don't have a God-fearing bone in my body. I believe in God about as much as I do in the Easter Bunny. Yet, I somehow allow myself to believe that these voices are part of something beyond human comprehension. I feel they come from something that naturally occurs in the universe, but I can't begin to tell you where they come from or what their purpose is.", "input": "", "output": "Is that a satisfying feeling--that the voices are beyond our comprehension?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose so. It's comforting to me. The voices make me feel like there is something out there that is far more important and grandiose than our mundane existence. Jesus, I'm really starting to sound like a fucking religious nut now. I don't know how to adequately explain these feelings, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right, Tom. It's very clear to me that this is important to you. I'm really rather surprised you hadn't mentioned this sooner."}, {"instruction": "How was I to bring something like this up? It sounds too damn unbelievable, and I feel like a flake even now, trying to articulate my experiences.", "input": "", "output": "You've done a very good job so far."}, {"instruction": "Well, shit. Thanks so much, Doc. Just do me a favor and don't dismiss these as merely night terrors.", "input": "", "output": "Very well."}, {"instruction": "You say that with such sincerity and without a shred of patronization. So now that I'm off Prozac, do you have any other plans for me?", "input": "", "output": "Well, would you feel comfortable pursuing another type of medication?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. So far, finding the right drug has been sort of a crap shoot.", "input": "", "output": "Usually it is. It sometimes takes a bit of experimentation to find the right drug and dosage that's appropriate for a particular person."}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I'm game for it.", "input": "", "output": "All right. What I'd like to do is start you on Zoloft, 20 mg. once each morning. We'll do a six-week trial just as we did with the Prozac. We need to wait about a week before you can start the new medication, to allow time for Prozac to leave your system. But if your headaches persist, please tell me right away and I'll refer you to a specialist, all right?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Here's your new prescription. I'll see you in two weeks."}, {"instruction": "Cool.", "input": "", "output": "But call me if..."}, {"instruction": "Sure, Doc. Sweet dreams.", "input": "", "output": "Very funny. Goodbye, Tom."}, {"instruction": "How's it going?", "input": "", "output": "Oh! Hello, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.", "input": "", "output": "No harm done; I've been rather engrossed in my notes here and lost track of time. Please come in and take a seat."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I see you're back at the chair this time. I take it you're getting more sleep these days?"}, {"instruction": "Sharon is here.", "input": "", "output": "I beg your pardon?"}, {"instruction": "Sharon, my ex-girlfriend? She came into town last week.", "input": "", "output": "You'd been keeping in contact with her pretty regularly via e-mail, hadn't you?"}, {"instruction": "For a while, yes. But the frequency of the e-mails between us eventually dropped off pretty dramatically. So when she called me and told me she was in town, it was quite a shock. I hadn't been in contact with her in over five months.", "input": "", "output": "Did she come to San Francisco to see you?"}, {"instruction": "No. At least I don't think so. Hell, I'm not sure. She told me that she enrolled at UCSF for graduate studies. She was supposed to have gotten married about a year ago, but that got postponed. I guess she ended up breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 back in January. Then she graduated from college in June and enrolled at UCSF. I guess they have a really good nursing school there or something.", "input": "", "output": "The San Francisco branch of the University of California does specialize in health sciences and it's renowned for both its school and its medical research and discoveries."}, {"instruction": "Really? So she wasn't making it up then. That's good.", "input": "", "output": "You sound almost disappointed that Sharon was telling the truth."}, {"instruction": "I guess I am a little. I don't know. When it rains it pours, you know? I want to be with Rachel, but then there's this new girl in the programming department that I sort of find intriguing, too. And now my ex fucking girlfriend is in town and is apparently here to stay, opening up wounds in my heart I thought had long since healed.", "input": "", "output": "There's a new girl at work that you're interested in?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, let me tell you the whole story. I want Rachel, right? But it appears that she wants to get it on with this other guy who sits in a cubicle about fifty feet away from her. He's the guy who showed up with Rachel at Gina's wedding reception. They hang out with each other after work a lot--at least that's what I hear. And who knows what else they're doing? Anyway, last week, Rachel sent me an e-mail asking me out to lunch. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. I really thought that maybe this was the sign that she finally wanted something to happen between us.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "But when I met her at the lobby that day, she had Kelly at her side. Kelly's the new programmer. She's quite funny, actually, and easy to be around. She's also deaf. It's really amazing how she lip-reads people so accurately. I've never been around someone who's handicapped, and I just had this sense of awe at how well she could adapt.", "input": "", "output": "I agree that it takes a great deal of strength to overcome a disability like that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Which sense would you lose, Charles, if you had to give one up?", "input": "", "output": "Pardon?"}, {"instruction": "If you had to give up one of your five senses, which would you lose?", "input": "", "output": "I haven't really given it much thought."}, {"instruction": "Come on! Pick one.", "input": "", "output": "I can't. I'm quite attached to them all."}, {"instruction": "Oh, for crying out loud. I can't believe no one has ever asked you that little hypothetical before. If I had to choose one, I'd give up my hearing. I mean think about it. If you were blind, you'd never be able to see the beauty of a sunset, or watch a good movie, or see history unfold before you when it's shown on the nightly news. You can't lose your sense of smell because it works hand-in-hand with your sense of taste, which means you'd pretty much lose two senses at once. So both of those are also out. That leaves just your sense of hearing and your sense of touch. And you don't want to go through life not being able to feel physical pleasure, hot and cold, the smoothness of glass, or the softness of a woman's breast. With hearing, what are you losing? Fucking car horns. People blabbering about mindless bullshit. Jack hammers. Snoring. Some annoying jerk sitting next to you who has a loud, whistling nostril.", "input": "", "output": "That last one wasn't directed toward me, was it?"}, {"instruction": "No. Your nostrils are just fine, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. Well, what about the sound of an ocean surf? Music from your favorite artist? A bird chirping a morning song? Wouldn't you miss those?"}, {"instruction": "I think I could live without all that. I can imagine music. Do you ever hum a song to yourself and hear it clearly through your head, replaying over and over again? You don't need hearing for that. Your brain can reproduce sound without any help from ears. I can easily imagine all the sounds I want to hear. I just get a sense that being deaf would be immensely peaceful.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry. Where was I? We got on this tangent on deafness and...oh, yeah! So I met Rachel in the lobby, and she had Kelly at her side. The first thing she did was to introduce me to her, and tell me how Kelly likes to write short stories like I do, and that we have this in common, and we have that in common, blah, blah, blah. Our whole lunch was like that. Rachel was really trying hard to hook Kelly and I up.", "input": "", "output": "But you have no interest in Kelly?"}, {"instruction": "I think she's really attractive. I'll give her that. But I'm not deaf! She can do sign language, and I have no clue how to do that. Well, that's not entirely true. She did teach me how to sign \"asshole\" when Scott Collavito was putting his moves on her and she resisted. When she told me about it, I had to laugh. It's just more proof to support my belief that Scott is a swollen, festering gonad. By the end of the week, our whole department was signing \"asshole\" whenever Scott walked by. It was pretty fucking funny. But I just can't see myself with Kelly. She's almost too good for me. I think she's a little out of my league. Of course Rachel isn't exactly in my ballpark, either.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Kelly realized that Rachel was trying to set the two of you up?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, definitely. It was very obvious. And a couple times at the table, while Rachel was going on about our similarities, Kelly and I just sort of looked at each other knowingly and smirked.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk to Kelly at all during this lunch event?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. She asked me if I hung out at the Bull Market after work. I told her that I hadn't been there in a while. They should definitely change the name of that place to \"The Meat Market,\" though. Usually, that's the place to go if you want to go home with one of your co-workers.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't think Kelly was trying to hit on me or anything, though it's hard to tell with the way she talks. I haven't quite gotten used to her speech impediment enough to pick up the inflections in her voice. I guess she doesn't talk completely normally because of her deafness. She sort of sounds like someone who has a really bad cold. I don't know if that's the best way to describe it. It's not distracting or anything...just different.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds as if you like her."}, {"instruction": "I do like her. She's really a cool person.", "input": "", "output": "But not someone you'd consider asking out?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, okay? This is all very confusing for me right now. When Sharon and I were in bed together this past weekend, it was like I had stepped back in time.", "input": "", "output": "You and Sharon..."}, {"instruction": "Did the nasty. Yeah. We met and went out to dinner. I had a few drinks, and she came back to my apartment. One minute, the two of us were on the couch talking, and the next minute, Sharon's head was bobbing up and down in my lap.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Look, I know it probably wasn't the wisest thing to do. Getting involved with Sharon again is not my intention. I wanted to get laid, all right? I hadn't had sex in over two years, Charles. Playing with yourself gets a little old after a while and makes you yearn for the real thing that much more. I think Sharon knew I didn't want anything more than what we had that night. I guess you could say that we came to an understanding. Ha!", "input": "", "output": "Cute."}, {"instruction": "But when I was making love to her, I could feel those old feelings emerging. I couldn't keep our sex at a purely lustful, impersonal level. I'm probably one of the few men on the planet who can't separate sex and love. Most men wouldn't give a woman a single moment's thought after they'd just fucked them. I can't do that. I get attached. I get emotional. I'm like a fucking girl.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think mixing emotions with sex is necessarily a bad thing, Tom. Quite the contrary. I'd be more concerned if you had an emotionless sexual encounter. However, I don't like the idea of you getting involved with Sharon again. You and I both know that the two of you were together for all the wrong reasons."}, {"instruction": "I'm aware of that. But we've both grown since then, and I'm sure she's no more in a hurry to jump back into a relationship with me than I am with her. And my heart still pines for Rachel. I think. Fuck! Three fucking women! I'm just going to buy a Twister game and a bottle of baby oil, and then I'll call all three of them over so we can have a wild orgy. Call it \"Sexfest '98.\"", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that would be a good idea. How's the medication doing? Are you experiencing any side-effects since you've switched to Zoloft?"}, {"instruction": "Nope. At least none that I've noticed. Except I think it took a little longer for me to get it up with Sharon that night. But I might have had a whiskey-dick, though.", "input": "", "output": "A whiskey-dick?"}, {"instruction": "You know, when it's difficult to get an erection because you're too drunk? Never mind.", "input": "", "output": "Well, our time's about up. I'll see you in two weeks?"}, {"instruction": "That's fine. Thanks for rescheduling me last week, by the way. I had to go to that Seybold conference they held downtown.", "input": "", "output": "No problem. Take care, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I'm fine--as fine as miserable can be.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like some tissues?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I'm sure.", "input": "", "output": "Very well. Do you want to talk about what's on your mind? It's okay, Tom. Take a few moments if you need to."}, {"instruction": "I'm getting worse and worse. Lonelier and lonelier. I don't think I can go on like this much longer. I was flipping through different Internet sites the other night, and I found one that stored an archive of photos and videos related to death.", "input": "", "output": "Tom..."}, {"instruction": "Let me finish. I sifted through the archive and came to a video file of R. Budd Dwyer's suicide. He was our State Treasurer back in Pennsylvania about 11 years ago. The local news was covering his upcoming sentencing, as he had been charged with mail fraud, bribery, and racketeering. All along, Dwyer professed his innocence. The day before he was to be sentenced, he held a press conference that was broadcast live. He gave a speech about how he was being used as an example and that all those close to him knew he was innocent. Then his speech took a more ominous turn as he asked everyone to offer prayers for his family. He motioned for one of his aides to approach and hand him a large manila envelope, which was thought to have contained instructions for his aides to read later. Instead, Dwyer pulled a loaded .357 Magnum. I remember coming home from school and watching the replays, over and over again. They'd show him reaching into the envelope, pulling out the gun, and as he was trying to calm the people in the room down--everyone was pleading with him not to do it--he quickly stuck the barrel into his mouth and pulled the trigger. I couldn't believe they showed the whole thing on TV. They kept the camera on Dwyer as his body collapsed to the floor. Thick, dark blood was streaming out of every orifice on his face. I'll never forget the expression he had in death. It was one of complete shock at first, as his facial muscles involuntarily tensed up from the blast. And then suddenly, his eyes relaxed, and he just looked alone. That's the one thing I got out of watching that video: the fact that even though he was amongst all those people in that room, even though he had a wife and children who loved him, it was very clear how utterly alone he was. Last night, I replayed that video about ten or fifteen times. I tried...I really tried to find any glimmer of peace hidden within Dwyer's face. I wanted there to be a realization in his eyes that he knew he was now dead and that what he did made everything better. But there was no such realization. He simply looked hideous, emotionless. His expression was as empty as my life.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you then drew the conclusion that suicide solves nothing."}, {"instruction": "It solves nothing, but ends everything, Charles. It's the one answer that everyone wants me to avoid, but I feel is inevitable. I can't live like I have been living for much longer. I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. But if it's to be that way, it's better that \"the rest of my life\" amounts to only a few more months rather than a few more years.", "input": "", "output": "Don't discount your progress like that, Tom. Don't you feel any improvement since you've been on the medication?"}, {"instruction": "Drugs aren't going to make me more popular or more accepted by my peers, Charles. I'm a born loner. And I don't think it's a coincidence that the difference between \"loner\" and \"loser\" is only one letter. Growing up, I was never given the true opportunity to set a foundation for lasting friendships and relationships. In high school, while everyone else was throwing parties, drinking, getting laid, making friends, and having a general good time among friends, I was locked in my bedroom, illuminated only by a black light, listening to Led Zeppelin music. Consequently, my mother thought I was using drugs in high school. My brother used to tell me how she'd search in vain through my dresser for drug paraphernalia while I was away. It's funny how she mistook loneliness for drug addiction. I guess the symptoms of the two are pretty close.", "input": "", "output": "One often leads to the other."}, {"instruction": "I guess so. If mom were to go through my dresser now, she'd find the very items she sought so many years ago. I still have my pipe with a partially-smoked bowl that I last used with Karina. I sure do miss that girl. She used to let me hold her as she was sleeping on my couch the few days she spent the night. I wish I could hold someone that way right now. Thanks to her, I now have a thing for brunettes, especially the Irish, Latin-American, and Italian types.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I've really gotten desperate in the love category. You're really going to like this one. I went to a video dating service last weekend.", "input": "", "output": "Really? What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, they'd been sending me letters for months, and I just finally gave in and filled out this questionnaire and sent it back to them. It asked what type of woman I wanted to be with, what my interests were, and so on. So they called me back a week later and asked me to make a free appointment with them, which I did. It was easy making the appointment. Showing up for it was the hard part.", "input": "", "output": "But you showed up?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, though I felt very embarrassed. I definitely didn't want to be there. The adrenaline coursing through my veins at the time was urging me to flee. But I stayed. The receptionist greeted me warmly and led me to a small room with a TV. She asked me to watch a video that explained what the company was all about. As she left me to the video, I looked around the room and noticed two tissue boxes on a small bookshelf. The video included interviews from supposed \"satisfied customers\" who told why they'd sought out the video dating service. They all talked about how hard it was to meet people and that their jobs didn't allow for it, but it all smacked of desperation to me. And that's how I felt: desperate. One woman on the tape said she was glad to have finally found someone really special and that she was happy she no longer had to be alone. I started to get upset. I guess the video has that effect on a lot of people since there were tissues all over the god damned place.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, after about ten minutes and three tissues, another woman stepped into the room, introduced herself as one of the service reps there, and sat down at the table with me. For the next fifteen minutes, we went through a basic interview process: what I do for a living, how much I make, what I'm looking for in a woman, what I like to do for fun, etc. Finally, we got down to the cost of their services, and I about fucking died.", "input": "", "output": "How much was it?"}, {"instruction": "Their fucking membership for one year was over two thousand dollars! I thought I was going to have a heart attack. What was even scarier was the fact that I actually considered it for about another 10 milliseconds.", "input": "", "output": "What did you say to the rep?"}, {"instruction": "I told her that this was nowhere near within my budget and, like a true salesperson, she then proceeded to negotiate the price. She eventually said I could try six months as a trial period, but they'd still need a $700 deposit from me that day.", "input": "", "output": "Did you do it?"}, {"instruction": "Hell no, I didn't do it! Are you crazy? Even if I were to spend that kind of money on a membership with them, could they assure me I'd ever find someone to be with? No. I mean, if I were to take that kind of money with me to some street corner downtown, at least I'd be assured a piece of ass.", "input": "", "output": "True."}, {"instruction": "For all their services and fees, they couldn't promise me that. So I told her that I didn't want to spend anything today and that I'd think about it. Basically, I was politely telling her that she'll never hear from me again. And then she totally went into sales mode. She was really pretty shameless and ruthless about it.", "input": "", "output": "What did she say?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the one thing she said was--and it will stick in my mind forever: \"What do you mean you don't want to spend anything today? Don't you know that Christmas is coming up soon? Don't you want someone to be with for the holidays?\"", "input": "", "output": "Wow."}, {"instruction": "Pretty low fucking blow, don't you think? My jaw dropped when she said that, and she knew she had fucked up at that point. If there had been any chance that I'd go with the dating service, it was gone when she opened her fat mouth. But she didn't even have the decency to stop there. She went on to say, \"You have to ask yourself how much you're willing to spend to find the love of your life.\" I could no longer take it. Standing up, I replied, \"You should ask yourself how far you'll go to exploit the loneliness of others without losing sleep over it,\" and then I bolted out the door.", "input": "", "output": "I certainly don't blame you. But I'm not sure I understand why you decided to do this now. During our last session, you felt overwhelmed with romantic opportunities in Sharon, Kelly, and Rachel."}, {"instruction": "I hardly see them as opportunities, unless you mean opportunity for heartbreak. That's the only thing any of them could promise me. I just felt that if I went to a service that matched me with a woman based on our mutual interests, I'd have a better chance at  lasting companionship. I just never intended for it to be so damn expensive.", "input": "", "output": "You're not having second thoughts about that place are you?"}, {"instruction": "I have second thoughts about the idea of that place, but I won' t go back, not after the way I was treated.", "input": "", "output": "Very well. Our time's about up, Tom. I don't like to hear this suicidal talk. We both know you don't want to end up that way. You do have something to live for, you have to give yourself a chance."}, {"instruction": "Of course I don't want to end up that way, Charles. But I also know that a lot of us don't have a choice when it comes to destiny.", "input": "", "output": "I need to know, Tom, whether you're planning on committing suicide imminently?  Are you?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'm not going to do it in the next month or so, if that's what your asking.  But I'm not going to promise that I won't think about it.", "input": "", "output": "We can talk about this together in our next session, all right?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose so, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I don't suppose that you'd consider coming in once a week, would you?"}, {"instruction": "I really do have you worried, Charles.  Not a chance.  I'll see you in two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I'll settle for that."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Thomas."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Tom. Come on in; take a seat."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "How have you been?"}, {"instruction": "A little better since the last time you saw me. Not much, but I'm better.", "input": "", "output": "That's good; I was very concerned..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I was a little concerned myself, especially after I started having wet dreams about the Golden Gate Bridge.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Those delicate lines, the sloping curves of steel, the chilled, polluted waters of the San Francisco Bay swirling seductively underneath...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, I think I get the idea."}, {"instruction": "There's just something very romantic about the idea of committing suicide off the Golden Gate. I guess we have Hollywood to blame for that. Of course, the city is going to make it a lot more difficult to accomplish, if they'll build that new \"suicide-deterrent\" fence. I'm surprised the city's actually considering spending that kind of money on people like us. It's really rather touching.", "input": "", "output": "All sarcasm aside, do you still spend a large portion of your time contemplating suicide?"}, {"instruction": "No. Lately, I've been spending more time contemplating all of life as a whole. Sunsets tend to do that to me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I really enjoy watching sunsets. I do it pretty regularly nowadays. The beauty and peacefulness of a sunset really sets my mind at ease. When I look into the western sky at dusk, I think to the future, to thousands of possibilities, wishing to realize my dreams for love in my life and for bigger and better things to start happening to me. When I was a teenager, back home in Pennsylvania, I lived in an apartment complex with my Mom and my brother, Alex. The residents all shared a very large swimming pool, with a clubhouse and a large balcony facing west, overlooking the pool. Late in the afternoon, either after school or during the summer breaks, I would climb the steps to that balcony and gaze at the sunset. I was very lonely even at that age, though I neither realized nor complained about it back then. The sun and I had this strange sort of bond--we were both lost, lonely souls shining brightly for all to see, only to slowly disappear against the horizon, taking our light with us, seemingly forgotten by all whom we once illuminated.", "input": "", "output": "Very poetic. Why don't we delve more into that time period? What was your life like during your high school years? Were you very active?"}, {"instruction": "Not really, no. I played a bass guitar in the high school jazz band for a while, but that was about the extent of my extra-curricular activities. Like I've said before, most of my time was spent at home locked in my bedroom.", "input": "", "output": "Did you date?"}, {"instruction": "Haven't I talked to you about this before? No, I never dated in high school. But it's not like I wasn't asked, mind you.", "input": "", "output": "How often were you asked out?"}, {"instruction": "A few times. I guess some of the girls grew frustrated by the fact that I never took the initiative, so they resorted to asking me out. I always turned them down, though.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I was too shy, for one thing. I was absolutely frightened of people and even more so of girls. But my shyness apparently didn't deter them all that much. I guess I was a cute teenager--I was once told I could get any girl I wanted if only I asked. It's a bit ironic that women used to approach me so much back then, but don't give me the time of day now. Life can be very cruel.", "input": "", "output": "That's your self-esteem talking. If there's one aspect of your personality that's most detrimental to your social life, it's your ability to be unjustly hard on yourself, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Whatever. I just wish I had done things differently in high school. I wish I would have gone out with those girls, for one thing. Maybe I'd have more confidence in myself now. I should have accepted Jennifer's invitation to that stupid Sadie Hawkins dance. If only I didn't screw things up with her by throwing away that damned rose...", "input": "", "output": "Hindsight is always twenty-twenty, Tom. What happened with the rose?"}, {"instruction": "Jennifer, one of the more attractive girls in my high school, really hounded me during my junior year. And I completely blew her off. It makes me sick to my stomach thinking back on it. It's tying me up in knots just bringing it up.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "On Sweetest Day, students brought roses for their boyfriends and girlfriends and passed them out in class. I can't remember the color scheme exactly. I think that if you got a yellow rose, it meant that it was from a \"friend.\" If you got a red rose, it represented love. Well, I received a red rose that day, and it was from Jennifer.", "input": "", "output": "How did that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "It made me feel confused. There were several emotions coursing through me at that moment. I'd been made fun of by my peers earlier in life, and I think that had really gotten to me. I never felt like I was ever on the same level as everyone else. And those feelings of inadequacy built up in me well into my high school years. When I got the rose and read the little card that came with it, I got the impression I was the butt of Jennifer's joke. I didn't really want to believe that she was actually interested in me. Instead, it made more sense that she sent a rose just to mock me. So I stood up, carried the rose to the wastebasket, and threw it away.", "input": "", "output": "You threw away the rose?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Can you believe that? And Jennifer was right there at the time. When she saw me do it, she was stunned. I watched as she began whispering to a couple of her friends sitting nearby, and then she started crying. She got so upset that she had to leave the classroom.", "input": "", "output": "What went through your mind at that point?"}, {"instruction": "More confusion. I realized I had made a big mistake, but it was too late. It was definitely not one of the proudest moments of my life. Years later, I heard she started having a long series of bad relationships. I understand she's still single now. I have to wonder how much that incident affected the way she feels about herself now. Maybe I'm partly to blame for her loneliness as well as my own.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever attempt to apologize to her?"}, {"instruction": "I think I did indirectly. I told one of her friends to tell her I was sorry, but I never actually spoke to Jennifer. In fact, I don't think I've ever spoken directly to her, unless you count her answering machine.", "input": "", "output": "You left an apology on her answering machine?"}, {"instruction": "I guess you could call it that. This was years later, just before I got out of college. I was home one weekend, very drunk, and started thinking about Jennifer. I found out the number to her dorm at the school she was attending, and decided to give her a call. Her answering machine picked up, and I just left a message, which she never returned, of course.", "input": "", "output": "What did you say in the message?"}, {"instruction": "I gave my name and reminded her that we had gone to high school together. I said I really regretted hurting her and wished I had gotten to know her back then. Then I told her to take care, left my number, and said goodbye. After I hung up, I started crying.", "input": "", "output": "Did it surprise you that you began to cry after hanging up the phone?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. There are a lot of nasty habits that I developed in high school and have never shaken off. Most of my anti-social behavior stems back to those days. It was back then that I perfected the art of closing inward. So it's not at all surprising that I look back on those years with so much regret and pain. Can you imagine, Charles, having no friends for four years, graduating, and then moving to another level of social isolation on a college campus? It was terrible. I must admit, though, that I at least learned how to be completely self-sufficient. But I really didn't have a choice, did I?", "input": "", "output": "There were choices, but I imagine you made the best of what you thought you had available to you. It's unfortunate we didn't meet ten years ago."}, {"instruction": "Well, thanks for saying so. I guess I should have sought therapy back then. But there were just too many aspects of myself that I didn't want to face.", "input": "", "output": "We're about out of time, Tom. I'd like to talk further with you about your high school and college life in our next session. Would that be all right?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I guess it would be.", "input": "", "output": "Very well. I'll see you in two weeks."}, {"instruction": "Fine. Two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Tom. Please come in."}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "Uneventful, even by Tom Darden standards.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Just the normal routine. Sometimes getting caught up in routine can be a good thing, though.", "input": "", "output": "How is that?"}, {"instruction": "It's helped me get my mind off things...off my problems.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. Last time you were here, we talked a bit about your high school days. I would like to pick up on that and move on to your college years, if we could."}, {"instruction": "What do you want to know?", "input": "", "output": "We can be as specific or as general as you'd like. But let's start off with, for example, your first impressions of college. Why don't you describe for me your thoughts and feelings the first day you arrived on campus at...which school did you attend?"}, {"instruction": "Penn State, like my brother.", "input": "", "output": "Uh, not a bad school."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I was surprised I got accepted--my SAT scores weren't the greatest. I definitely squeaked in. The fact that my grandfather went to Penn State didn't hurt my chances, either. Funny that a guy I never knew could help me from beyond the grave.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So do you want me to start talking about my first day from the point I moved in and unpacked--the whole sha-bang?", "input": "", "output": "If that's where you'd like to begin, sure."}, {"instruction": "Well, the reality that I was finally in college didn't really hit me until my mom had hugged me goodbye and I was left there alone in that dorm for the first time. I remember that moment as one of the loneliest in my life. I had never felt more abandoned, more homesick. School wasn't scheduled to start for another two days, and I was the first person on my floor to have arrived besides the residence hall assistant.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do those two days?"}, {"instruction": "I cried a lot. I blubbered myself to sleep both nights. I didn't really know how to react to my new home. All I could do was cry and wait for my roommate to show up. I wanted to meet him and the rest of the students on my floor and get the introductions over with.", "input": "", "output": "What was your roommate like when you met him?"}, {"instruction": "Tom was several years older than me. I guess he took some time off after high school before enrolling at Penn State. It's funny that his name was also Tom. The rest of the floor had to develop special nicknames to differentiate the two of us. I was \"Silent Thomas,\" for obvious reasons, and he was \"Tom of Porsche,\" since he drove one. His family was pretty well off. It was amazing how much stuff he had managed to pack in that car when I went to help him unload.", "input": "", "output": "He fit all of his belongings inside a Porsche?"}, {"instruction": "Well, no. Most of his stuff was in his girlfriend's car. Leah was a junior there. I was really taken aback by how attractive she was. She had jet black hair down past her shoulders and deep green eyes. I would have to say I developed an enormous crush on Leah, since she ended up spending a lot of time in our dorm that year.", "input": "", "output": "Did she know of your feelings?"}, {"instruction": "That I had the hots for her? I'm sure she did. Leah was a very perceptive, confident, and dominating person. She definitely wore the pants in her relationship with my roommate. For such a petite woman, she was very commanding and convincing. She knew how beautiful she was and knew exactly how to use that to her advantage. I liked Leah, though, because she was always willing to talk to me when no one else was around, and she always had a reassuring air about her that made me feel less homesick. She put me at ease, one of the first women to succeed at doing so. But Leah was also partly responsible for one of the most traumatic experiences of my life.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Like I said, Leah was a very manipulative woman. She derived a certain level of pleasure from screwing with the minds of men. And despite my roommate's macho posturing, he was a complete pushover when it came to his girlfriend. One night, when I thought I was going to be left alone in the dorm for a significant amount of time, I began to relieve myself by masturbating. Well, Leah had forgotten something she left in the dorm, and Tom gave her the keys so she could return and get it. She ended up walking in on me and catching me in the act. I never felt more embarrassed in all my life.", "input": "", "output": "Masturbation isn't something to be embarrassed or ashamed about."}, {"instruction": "I know that. But like I've told you before, I'm a very active whacker, pud-pounder--whatever you want to call it. I'm definitely not against boloney-bopping. I'm a chicken-choker all the way. It was the circumstances that humiliated me. While I was masturbating that night, I had been fantasizing about Leah. And then suddenly, there she was standing at the doorway, staring at me with my dick in my hand.", "input": "", "output": "I can understand your predicament."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it was very unnerving. What made matters worse was that she didn't even have the decency to leave. She continued to walk in, casually strode to Tom's dresser, picked up her purse, told me to have a good night, and then closed the door behind her. I think she derived pleasure from catching me, and I guiltily wondered if she knew she had been the object of my fantasies. The next night, though, really changed my relationship with Tom and Leah forever.", "input": "", "output": "What happened then?"}, {"instruction": "This is going to be a little difficult for me to get out.", "input": "", "output": "It's all right, Tom. Take your time."}, {"instruction": "I just don't want you to get the wrong impression about me after I tell you about this. I'm not proud of the experience in the least.", "input": "", "output": "I will not pass any sort of irrational judgment on you, Tom. I assure you of that."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'll trust you not to. The next night, we were all in the dorm together, and Tom and Leah had been wrestling around on his bed. I was seated at my desk, trying to finish writing a paper. Soon, I realized that the wrestling had stopped and that they had begun touching each other much more gently and intimately. I could really begin to feel this incredibly thick tension in the room, to the point that the hair on the back of my neck raised on end. Before I knew it, I had dropped my pencil and was watching the couple making out. They began kissing, slowly at first, moving their hands up and down each other. I wasn't sure they realized I was still there, but at the same time, I also felt like perhaps this was all somehow being orchestrated on my behalf. The thought that I was somehow watching something I shouldn't be really started to arouse me. Tom had unbuttoned her blouse, and as he continued to kiss at her neck, Leah looked over at me and said, \"You can stay and watch, if you'd like.\" Tom glanced over at me, smirked, and then gave me a wink, as if to say, \"Yeah, Tom, stick around; this is going to get good.\" So I just sat there, watching, rather stunned. I felt some of the strangest sensations I had ever experienced as they continued undressing and kissing each other harder. My whole body began to tingle. It was like we were all doing something so incredibly wrong and risky that the urge to flee that moment would overwhelm us. But I stayed. Soon I realized, as Tom removed Leah's panties and started performing oral sex, that I had an erection. I wanted to leave the room. I really did. There were a few seconds in which I thought I would surely run out.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what kept me there. You read about this stuff happening to people or watch it in an X-rated video, and you think, \"I wish something like that would happen to me.\" But when you're actually in one of those situations, there's a lot of emotional conflict going on inside you. I was torn between my own morals and my raw sexual desire. Ultimately, I think I was disappointed at how quickly my instinctive sexuality won over reason. I had soon taken my own pants off and began masturbating right in front of them. Neither one of them seemed shocked by this. And as I jerked off, Leah sat up and pushed Tom back so that she could give him a blow job. After a few more moments, Tom and Leah started having sex. A thousand thoughts were buzzing through my brain, most of which were negative. I thought about how wrong this all was, it was like I was committing some horrible crime. But I kept watching, I kept masturbating. I finally stood up from the chair and approached the foot of the bed, by Leah's pillow. As Tom continued to thrust at her, she turned her head to me and whispered, \"Do you want me to put it in my mouth? Hmm?\" As I continued to slowly beat off, I just sort of nodded stupidly, and she grinned. I soon realized she had no intention of performing oral sex on me, she just wanted to toy with me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "\"You want me to suck you off really bad, don't you?\" she went on to say. As I started whacking off faster, she continued her little game: \"Tell me you want me to suck you off.\" And of course I managed to mumble something out along those lines. But before I knew it, I was shooting off onto the bed. This apparently was exactly what they wanted--Tom started to really pound at her, and she began crying out. After several more moments, it was all over with. I was already putting my underwear back on, when Leah turned to me and said, chuckling: \"Welcome to the family, Tom.\" I didn't answer. As they cuddled each other in Tom's bed, I finished putting my clothes back on, grabbed my keys, and went out for a long walk. I didn't return for two hours.", "input": "", "output": "How did this episode make you feel afterwards?"}, {"instruction": "If I had been more comfortable with my own identity and self-esteem, perhaps I'd look back on the incident differently. Hell, maybe I'd be bragging about it. But as it stands, I regret that it ever happened. I felt like I had been taken advantage of, used. The only thing I got out of that experience was more confusion about myself.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk to Tom or Leah about how it made you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I spoke to each of them separately later on. I found out from Tom that they had led a swinging lifestyle for a few years. I didn't really know what the term \"swinging\" was. Leah explained to me that she and Tom agreed to sleep with other partners, often in the form of group sex. She apologized to me later, because I told her that it made me feel very uncomfortable. My friendship with the two of them was somewhat strained after that, as you may imagine. But they agreed not to involve me in anything like that again.", "input": "", "output": "Was that the first sexual experience you ever had with another person?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's funny. Some guys would have killed to have done something like that. My cousin brags to me about similar experiences he has almost routinely, but I've never told him about this. I just don't want people to know that it happened. Tom told me that he and Leah were both bisexual. So while I had been getting off watching them have sex, he and Leah had gotten off watching me.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And what worries me is that I'm not sure what turned me on more: watching her get fucked or watching him fuck her.", "input": "", "output": "Meaning?"}, {"instruction": "Meaning, did I have some sort of pent-up, latent homosexual tendencies I'd never realized? It really bothered me afterwards. To them, I was merely an extraneous sexual device to aid in their lovemaking. But to me, the whole scenario served as a metaphor for my own sexual and social frustrations. At the time, I was more worried about being gay than I was about how the incident related to my other personal problems on a broader scale. That was my biggest mistake. I must have dwelled on that threesome for months. Well, I guess I can't really call it a threesome. It's more like a two-and-a-half.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I can't believe I've revealed this to you. Do you realize you're the only person besides Tom, Leah, and Sharon who know about this? And who knows how many people each of them has told? That thought alone scares the hell out of me.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Why do you think? I just don't want people to know that about me, that something like that happened. People already wonder what sexual orientation I am because I never seem to be around women. Hell, I think even my own mother thinks I'm probably gay.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "The last time I went home to Pennsylvania, I took a drive to Pittsburgh to visit my brother Alex and his fianc\u00e9, Martha. They have a little son named Jordan who has recently started talking up a storm. While I was there, in front of everybody, Jordan said to Martha, \"Mommy, why does Uncle Tommy live by himself?\" Alex and Martha grinned and looked at me sort of nervously. And I recall that there were a few seconds of silence. I wanted to throttle the little runt. Damned if he weren't so innocent with his questions. If a three-year-old child can figure out the obvious, what must everyone around me think of my social life?", "input": "", "output": "So you believe everyone assumes you're alone because you're a closeted homosexual?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not gay, damnit!", "input": "", "output": "I'm not implying that you are, Tom."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what people think. I just know what they tell me.", "input": "", "output": "And what's that?"}, {"instruction": "That they thought I was gay, or assumed so, because I never went out with women. They don't understand that I'm not a closeted anything. I'm just afraid to be around others. People can't comprehend how another human being can have so much trouble doing something so basic as socializing. They can't possibly know what it's like for me.", "input": "", "output": "I want to go ahead and stop here for today, Tom, as it appears we've run over our usual time. I feel there's a lot more to discuss with regard to your college days and the feelings they've since evoked. How's your supply of Zoloft? Do you need me to write you another prescription?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think you better. I'm just about out.", "input": "", "output": "How has the medication been?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't experienced any side effects that I've noticed.", "input": "", "output": "Very well. I'd like to increase the dosage by ten milligrams. We'll do a six-week trial on it and see how that goes."}, {"instruction": "Fine.", "input": "", "output": "And I'll see you back here in two weeks."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "How was your last two weeks?"}, {"instruction": "Surprisingly, not too bad.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Don't look so disappointed, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "No, no. I'm quite pleased to hear it. You haven't described a week on a positive note in quite some time."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it has been a while.", "input": "", "output": "So tell me, what has occurred to make things so upbeat for you lately?"}, {"instruction": "I'm getting out of the god-damned Helpdesk, for one thing. I had applied for a position that's been posted for a while, and I interviewed for it shortly after our last session. I'm somewhat shocked, but I actually got the job.", "input": "", "output": "That's wonderful news, Tom. Congratulations. In which department will you be working?"}, {"instruction": "The Technical Writing department. I'll start next week. Since this new millennium bug program called SIIMole was created, there's been a high demand to develop a lot of documentation for it, and SII is apparently understaffed in that division. So I'm using the company's desperation as my ticket out of the Helpdesk.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure your hiring had nothing to do with anyone's desperation, Tom. You're quite modest about both your talent and your personal achievements."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, butter me up as much as you want, Charles, it makes my co-payments to you easier to part with.", "input": "", "output": "Well, in any case, I'm glad you've found a position more suited to your education. How do you think this will affect your feelings for Rachel? I know there's a lot of frustration on your part because you're attracted to her and she works with you in the same department."}, {"instruction": "I knew you were going to ask me about this. The fact is, Charles, I haven't really been giving her much thought lately. And even when I do leave the Helpdesk, Rachel is still an SII employee. And as far as I'm concerned, work relationships should be avoided at all costs. Do I think things between us will change when I start my new job? No. If anything, we'll drift apart from each other. That's the sad part. I developed some close friendships with these people, and now I'm going to be placed among people I neither know nor wish to be friends with.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Why would you say that?"}, {"instruction": "The whole Information Technology department at SII is brimming with conceit and egocentrism. Even though the Helpdesk is technically part of I.T., we've always been regarded by the rest of the department as a sort of rogue group of people, not worthy of being treated with the same respect that others are afforded. We are all mouthy, edgy, vulgar, and boisterous in our own little section. Every other segment of I.T. is comparatively quiet, over-disciplined, and unfriendly. I once walked through a room full of programmers and was amazed at how subdued the whole atmosphere was. Everyone was ignoring one another. The cubicles marked off everyone's perceived field of vision. If you weren't inside someone's cube, you didn't exist to that person. Very strange environment, even to me. I consider myself anti-social, but some of the I.T. employees make me look like a social butterfly. It must come with the territory. People who are around computers all day just seem to want to plug into their console and tune out everything around them. It's really rather Orwellian to observe.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. That's not my impression of that department. If anything, I would have said that programmers incorporate play into their jobs more than any other group at SII. Perhaps you are mistaking \"busy\" with \"anti-social?\""}, {"instruction": "Now you're starting to talk like the other I.T. people do. They say that we at the Helpdesk have more colorful personalities because we can afford to, because we don't spend our time doing much of anything else. Well, that's not true. The Helpdesk is the rear-end of the Information Technology department. We take more abuse, hear more complaints, and solve more problems than any other group does. If it weren't for our taking the brunt of the phone calls, and the troubleshooting, and the solving of all the issues that we do, the rest of the divisions of I.T. would have a lot more work on their hands.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you feel very unappreciated."}, {"instruction": "To say the least. Which is why I can't wait to get out of there. Once I start my duties in the Technical Writing department, I'll be exposed to the programming group in a much more intimate fashion. And I already know that I like some of the people there.", "input": "", "output": "I thought you said they were all egocentric?"}, {"instruction": "Not all of them; Kelly isn't like that, for example.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, yes. The deaf..."}, {"instruction": "So what if she's deaf? Why did you feel the need to point that out?", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't pointing it out, Tom, it was merely..."}, {"instruction": "Whatever. She's more woman than most I've met in my life.", "input": "", "output": "I think I'm beginning to see why you've abandoned your interest in Rachel."}, {"instruction": "I haven't abandoned anyone. But the more I think about it, the more I like being around Kelly and talking with her. Maybe it's just because I have to talk to her one-on-one quite regularly, while the other programmers have the luxury of contacting us via telephone. I feel more comfortable around her now than I did in the beginning. I'll admit that her handicap intimidated me at first. But now, I don't really recognize she has one. I sometimes think about asking her out, though right now, I'm sort of dating someone else...", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess dating isn't the best term to use. It's more like fucking. Sharon and I have been meeting pretty regularly now. At least once a week.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I take it that wasn't an approving \"hmm?\"", "input": "", "output": "I'm not here to judge you on your relationships."}, {"instruction": "Then I'm afraid you're not much use to me as a therapist.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you are mindful of the emotional repercussions you are bound to experience by engaging in any involvement with your ex-girlfriend, sexual or otherwise."}, {"instruction": "I am. I think I am. But getting together with Sharon at least for one night a week has really put me in better spirits lately. It's good to hold someone in my arms at night from time to time, especially following a really good lay.", "input": "", "output": "That may be so, but it wouldn't be wise to expect anything more from Sharon than what you have with her right now."}, {"instruction": "I know. I'm trying not to. But when I'm cuddled up with her, though, I can't help but think back to the time I had deeper feelings for her. It reminds me of how we used to see each other. Maybe that's a bad thing in the long run, but for now, it feels pretty damn satisfying.", "input": "", "output": "Are you practicing safe sex?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, when I actually have a condom handy.", "input": "", "output": "Occasional protection is pretty worthless, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "I'm aware of that, Charles. But I know Sharon. I think she's pretty particular about who she sleeps with nowadays.", "input": "", "output": "That may be so, but VD and AIDS don't harbor a class bias against any one group of people. Anyone can contract a disease, rich or poor, dirty or clean."}, {"instruction": "You're starting to sound like a god-damn public service announcement, Charles. I half expect Magic Johnson and Barney to waltz in here at anytime.", "input": "", "output": "Just please, try to be careful, Tom."}, {"instruction": "Whatever you say, Charles. At least I'm finally getting some on a regular basis. My dick is a happy dick--a happy dick indeed.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, well, it's clear that your mood has changed considerably since our last session."}, {"instruction": "Like I've said, it's been a good two weeks. What are you doing for Thanksgiving?", "input": "", "output": "I don't have any specific plans. How about you?"}, {"instruction": "I'll be at Sharon's. We'll probably spend most of the day thinking up new ways to use a turkey baster.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Come on, Charles, at least crack a smile, for Christ's sake. You really need to talk to somebody about your moodiness.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still taking Zoloft?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, every day.

Next time, I'd like to focus back on some of your earlier experiences, particularly your years with your step-father."}, {"instruction": "Oh, shit. You had to say the \"S\" word, didn't you? What are you trying to do, put me in a bad mood again so you can milk more money out of me?", "input": "", "output": "Would it be okay to discuss him next time?"}, {"instruction": "We'll see, Charles.

Sharon and I are getting married.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I see..."}, {"instruction": "We had been seeing each other for the past couple months, and soon everything became clear to me--Sharon and I know each other too well not to be together. We know how each of us thinks; we finish each other's sentences; we have a virtual map in our head of each other's body--these are things husbands and wives do. A few days ago, the two of us took a long stroll across the Golden Gate. Now, I've been in San Francisco a while, and the novelty of the Golden Gate Bridge had worn off the moment I paid my first $3 toll to reenter the city. But for Sharon, it's still an object of romance. As we were walking across the bridge; I stopped her, took her hands in mine, and then proposed to her, pulling out the ring I'd bought--damn expensive one at that. It's put a crimp in my budget for a while, but I guess I'll manage.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, I presented the ring and asked her to marry me. It was a really great place to do it, I thought. It was a clear day, the sun was about to set, and it wasn't too chilly like it usually is on the bridge. Some Japanese tourists actually stopped and took pictures of us as they maneuvered around Sharon and me.", "input": "", "output": "What did Sharon say?"}, {"instruction": "Well, what do you think she said? I already told you we were engaged. She smiled and said yes, of course!

How so?"}, {"instruction": "Sharon has had time to \"sow her oats,\" so to speak. She was too young for a long-term relationship when we first dated. But it's been over three years since our break-up. Sharon has gone through a couple of relationships since then, had her one-night flings, and experienced the many fraternity and sorority parties. I think she's had her fill. She told me recently that she couldn't get over how wild she used to be. I think she regrets not sticking with me the first time. The guys who wined, dined, and sixty-nined her since our breakup never really cared about Sharon as a whole individual. And I think she knows now that I've always loved her as a person, not merely as a walking ejaculate receptacle.", "input": "", "output": "While I can concede the possibility that Sharon has evolved over the past three years, I question whether you have. Frankly, I'm worried that you haven't really experienced enough social interaction or had relationships that would have allowed for substantial growth since the two of you were last involved. It's for that reason that I'm concerned you may not be seeing this situation as clearly as..."}, {"instruction": "Must you always attempt to undermine my attempts at happiness, Charles? Here I am, telling you how my entire outlook on life has changed, how the love of my life has come back to me, and how I can hear Julie Andrews singing a little ditty in my head every time I wake up in the morning, and what do you do? You try to make me feel like shit again. I thought I was paying you to make me feel good about myself, but lately, it seems like I feel worse leaving your office than I do coming in.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry you feel that way, Tom. Believe me when I say: I'm here to help. It's my job to point out that there are some problems with your relationship with Sharon. Now, it's entirely possible that I'm dead wrong and the two of you will end up happily married to each other for many years to come.

The last few weeks in which I haven't seen you were beyond wonderful. I've never felt happier in all my life. While you were gone, I didn't have someone drugging my ass up, or telling me to get out and socialize more often, or to read crappy self-help books as homework. I think I've found the source of my problems, and that source is you.
