Matthew?"}, {"instruction": "No, not Matthew! How dare you compare him to that man?", "input": "", "output": "To which man?"}, {"instruction": "Calvin. How dare you compare my only child to Calvin.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, but I didn't intend to make a comparison, Ms. Gregory. I'm just trying to understand you. Who is Calvin?"}, {"instruction": "My husband.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And you suspect that he has been hiding your letters?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. He takes them out of the mail while I am sleeping and he hides them from me and he thinks that I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "And how do you know? Have you found letters addressed to you in his possession?"}, {"instruction": "No. I haven't found them.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I haven't found them because I haven't looked. And I don't need to look because I know what the letters say and I know they have been written.", "input": "", "output": "Do you suspect that these missing letters are from some specific person?"}, {"instruction": "No. I don't suspect. I know. They are from Matthew.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think he's doing this?"}, {"instruction": "Doing what?", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think Calvin is hiding your son's letters?"}, {"instruction": "Because he's afraid.", "input": "", "output": "Afraid of what?"}, {"instruction": "Of me.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Can you tell me more about these feelings? Why do you think your husband is afraid of you?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. That is a question I've been unable to answer satisfactorily, although it has occupied much cogitation. There are no easy answers. And even if there were, I doubt they could be articulated in any known language. I don't know why Calvin is afraid of me. And I don't know why because there are too many reasons.", "input": "", "output": "Too many reasons? Do you think you could talk about these reasons for me?"}, {"instruction": "Well, perhaps he is afraid of me because of what I know. And perhaps because of what he has done and seen and what his father before him did and saw and what nonetheless he refuses to believe. And perhaps he is afraid of me because I am a woman. And because I am a woman who has had a past he doesn't understand, a past that can't be explained to him for reasons that can't be explained. And because this past carries forth into the present as I engage in activities in which he shares no interest or comprehension. And because I gave birth to the boy. And because he can't comprehend birth or motherhood or procreation, can only comprehend the raw physicalities engendered by his own hands. And perhaps he's afraid of me because of my mind, because of what I know, because I do understand these things which he does not.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think by hiding the letters, he's attempting to keep you ignorant about Matthew's well-being?"}, {"instruction": "That may be part of the reason.", "input": "", "output": "How long have you been married to Calvin, Ms. Gregory?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know. For years, really. Let me see. We were in school together at N.Y.U. That's where we met. Calvin was different then. We both were, I suppose. So many years ago. We were married a couple of years after I graduated and that was in 1964. My god. I guess we've been married for thirty years. Thirty years this year.", "input": "", "output": "Well, congratulations. It's quite an accomplishment to stay married for thirty years."}, {"instruction": "I hate the man. I've always hated him. Mutual hate and fear seem to be the only things we manage to agree upon.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you hate him?"}, {"instruction": "Because he is afraid of me and always has been although he's never had the courage to tell me so, brooding behind closed doors, lurking through the halls like some sort of lugubrious troll denying passage without first extracting his tithe of flesh, his pound of emotional remuneration. And because of his dirty ways, his physical shortcomings and his vindictive spirit. He is a repugnant and evil man.", "input": "", "output": "Why haven't you divorced him?"}, {"instruction": "I can't divorce him.", "input": "", "output": "Why not? You've expressed nothing but animosity."}, {"instruction": "Because he somehow managed to uncover enough information about my past to be dangerous. He knows I was an agent, and I think he knows that I'm in hiding. The risk is too great to both myself and Matthew. And something else.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I need him.", "input": "", "output": "When you first arrived this afternoon, you were extremely upset about a letter you suspect Calvin of hiding."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I've been very worried about Matthew because a few weeks ago I felt something in my sleep.", "input": "", "output": "You felt something?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. It was as if someone was sitting on my chest and trying to tell me something but no words were coming out, only this radiating pressure. I thought it might have been the visitors again, but when I opened my eyes, nothing was there. Then I heard Matthew's voice coming down the hall, calling me, and he was frightened of something, his voice small and distant as if he was still a little boy except it also sounded like he was talking to me from the other end of a very long pipe. I can't really explain it. I called out to him then to ask him what was wrong, but of course he wasn't there in the apartment and he couldn't hear me. Or if he could hear me, he didn't respond.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And how did this experience affect you?"}, {"instruction": "I knew that something had happened to Matthew and that he was trying to tell me. Trying to ask for my help.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And then, when the letter came, I knew. I always know. It's like a warmth in my spine that increases as the letter approaches, traveling over the sea. And by the time it arrives, I can feel what it says in my bones. And Calvin thinks I don't know, because how I know is something he will never be able to understand.", "input": "", "output": "Have you communicated with Matthew recently?"}, {"instruction": "We are always communicating.", "input": "", "output": "I mean have you spoken to him on the phone? Is he all right?"}, {"instruction": "Oh no. We don't speak on the phone. Lines can bugged and tapped. Calls can be traced. He writes me letters and I send him my thoughts.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Well we're almost out of time, but before you go I need to know a bit about your medical history for my records."}, {"instruction": "Yes, that's fine.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever been prescribed medication for any sort of psychological or behavioral disorder?"}, {"instruction": "No. Never.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with schizophrenia or any other mental illness?"}, {"instruction": "God no. I've never even been to see a therapist before. I've been afraid to tell my secrets.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. If I was to prescribe some medication for you, would you be willing to take it?"}, {"instruction": "No. Heavens no. I need to keep my wits about me. There is so much trouble and danger. The world is filled with dangers you can't even imagine, Doctor. And there is nothing wrong with me. Do you understand?", "input": "", "output": "The medication will just help you to view the world as less threatening. I wish you would give this a chance."}, {"instruction": "Perhaps it will help me view the world as less threatening, but it will do nothing to lessen the threat. Then they would find me for certain. I thought I could trust you, young man. I thought we had an understanding. I need you to help me sort things out. So many details. So many overlapping layers. It's hard to keep track.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to help you in any way I can."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Then I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Next week."}, {"instruction": "And Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I do wish you would have a dead-bolt installed in this door. You never know who might be lurking in the halls. Oh, and by the way, do you still want to see my journal?", "input": "", "output": "Absolutely. It would be very helpful."}, {"instruction": "I brought along a few pages. Here.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. I'll see you next week, okay?  That's Thursday, August 22 at 2 pm.  And I'll see about the dead-bolt."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor. And how are you? I'm having the most wonderful day myself. Simply splendid. Couldn't be better unless the sky broke itself open like a melon to slop its pulp in great watery fist-sized scoops down upon this teeming city. What a day that would be, the streets streaming meaningfully 'neath a viscose stew, their fires all extinguished, all extinguished the fires of malice, plotting and machination. No more tiny monsters and articulate wallpaper. No more conspiracies swelling up in the boiling asphalt like so many pregnant bellies. Such a day might be better than this one, but still methinks it would be a close match. And look at that! You put in a dead-bolt.", "input": "", "output": "I'm just trying to make you feel more comfortable. I'm glad to hear you're in such a good mood, Ms. Gregory. Is there any specific reason for your happiness?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes! There are many reasons, as usual. Every state of mind, every emotion is motivated by a complex network of interacting factors, wouldn't you say?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I would say that, or something similar. Now, do you think you could explain some of the reasons for me?"}, {"instruction": "I thought you'd never ask. First of all, I'm excited because this morning I waited for Calvin to go off on one of his prurient adventures through the seedy underbelly of North Beach. And he thinks I don't know the impetus behind his diurnal peregrinations, his concupiscence for all manner of perversions including algolagnia, sodomy, coprophilia and a particular thirst for auto-stimulation, especially in certain establishments of dubious character. He truly is a disgusting man, Doctor. The very thought of him flagellating himself in those peep show booths nauseates me deeply. One morning some years ago I followed him out on one of his walks to satisfy my curiosity. He went into the seediest of establishments and was gone for some 45 minutes as I sipped a cup of tea across the street keeping one eye on The Chronicle and the other on the orificial door of that den of unbridled iniquity. 45 minutes he was gone! 45 minutes ogling at the furry nether parts of those girls, those poor young girls twisting and gyrating their nubile globes and moons as he grunted, undoubtedly pressing his piggish face against the greasy plexiglass, shoving in quarter after palm-sweaty quarter. 45 minutes and then he emerged running his fingers through that oily hair and shuffled off down the street, slope-shouldered and bestial in his coat.", "input": "", "output": "And how did you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Disgusted more than anything else.", "input": "", "output": "Can you expand on that? Why do you think you felt disgusted?"}, {"instruction": "Because of the humiliating degradation suffered by those poor girls, mainly. Most of them barely over eighteen and trying to put themselves through school. That's no way to nurture the self, attempting to feed the mind by degrading the body.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And to think of my husband helping to make it all possible.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you might also be upset because Calvin feels the need to turn to sources other than yourself for sexual gratification?"}, {"instruction": "God no! What a ridiculous thought.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think it ridiculous?"}, {"instruction": "Because he is a man.", "input": "", "output": "I don't follow you."}, {"instruction": "Then perhaps you shouldn't follow. Perhaps you should move along beside me. That is, perhaps we should travel together.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Ms. Gregory. You lost me there. I don't understand what you're talking about."}, {"instruction": "Calvin and I haven't been intimate with one another in any normative connubial manner for quite some time. Not that I think it's any of your business, young man.", "input": "", "output": "If you don't feel comfortable discussing such private matters, I understand. We can talk about something else if you'd like."}, {"instruction": "I didn't say I felt uncomfortable. I said it's none of your business.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "You know Doctor, every day I wonder why. It's as if my brain were a television set with basic cable. And a movie channel or two, of course. I do enjoy the cinema, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "Well, yes. I do."}, {"instruction": "When one watches television, one is only able to view one channel at a time even though all the other channels carry on with their programming. One can only select a single channel out of all those different programs and advertisements and movies, all those myriad stories unfolding simultaneously. All you have to do is change stations to shift into a different world, turn the page and find yourself in middle of a different story. Am I making myself clear, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I believe so. Please continue."}, {"instruction": "Well, that's the way I see myself. A Helen of myriad stories. Sometimes I lose control and the channels start turning by themselves as if someone else has a more powerful remote than I do. Then I have to try to piece each story together from what few fleeting scraps of fabric I have been permitted to examine.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But there is always one program playing somewhere beneath the layers of noise, the cacophony of multiplicative narrative, the absurd discordant music of incongruity. Always, beneath it all, there is one continuous thread upon which I have grown to depend.", "input": "", "output": "And what is that?"}, {"instruction": "Why.", "input": "", "output": "Pardon?"}, {"instruction": "Why. It's as if one of my brain's stations is perpetually asking the question why. And why him. And why still after everything. Every day a part of me over and over again wondering for thirty years why why why why why like an engine's thrusting pistons accumulating heat, the energy spent finally turning the axles and forcing the wheels to spin, asphalt disappearing down the famished gullet of night itself as the question sputters forward with increasing momentum why why why toward the profoundest center of blackness. Enigma. Anomaly. Paradox. And finally the dark starving core of ignorance itself. Why. Why, Helen. Why did you marry that man? Why did you marry?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I see."}, {"instruction": "And still to this day, to this unfolding moment and this one and this with the sizzle of neurons and synapses, the inscrutable concussion of engines, still I wonder why with each road driven, intestinal and dark and unbelieving, always waiting for something to step out in front of the car and for myself to step on the brake pedal, skidding to a stop inches before an animal I cannot identify because it changes its form, protean and monstrous, none of its assumed shapes resembling anything I have ever seen before in nature shows or read about in books and I'm not even certain that it is an animal at all because it is nothing I can name, standing there wide-eyed in the headlights dripping and melting into each nameless shape or shapeless name and then somehow I would know the answers. Then somehow I would know why I married Calvin Gregory and even perhaps why I am still married to Calvin Gregory although I haven't touched the man, although I haven't touched \"man,\" in over twelve and a half years. But never has anything stepped in front of that steady engine of a question. Never have I even glimpsed a flank or a hoof or the bewildered and knowledgeable glimmer of an eye. The answer, I think, goes beyond roads and words and ears and eyes. The answer goes deeper than bones, deeper than the shadows of bones now long since rotten in the earth. Deeper even than the questions posed long before the knowledge of bones.", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Gregory, I don't understand what you're getting at."}, {"instruction": "The visitors.", "input": "", "output": "The visitors? What about them? Have they been back?"}, {"instruction": "They told me to marry Calvin Gregory. And for thirty years they have refused to disclose their reasons.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you suppose we could shift gears here?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.", "input": "", "output": "When you arrived today, you were extremely excited about something and you never explained to me what you were excited about."}, {"instruction": "The letter.", "input": "", "output": "Has Matthew written you another letter?"}, {"instruction": "No, although he will soon. I can feel the warmth beginning.", "input": "", "output": "Well then, what about the letter?"}, {"instruction": "I found it.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I already knew where it was because I could feel it. I could feel all of them. I never felt compelled to look because I knew what they said, and Calvin is a shrewd man. His booby traps are virtually undetectable.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So why did you decide to look for them today?"}, {"instruction": "You didn't believe me last week. I could tell. I'm beginning to be able to read you too. Just like my son. As if you too were part of me. My body. My flash and bulb. And because you didn't believe me, I began to doubt myself. The greatest possible weakness of an agent. But those letters were there in the desk drawer beneath the false bottom. Just where I knew they were. Just where I felt them.", "input": "", "output": "And you were excited to find the letters because their existence validated your suspicion?"}, {"instruction": "And my readings. I knew what all the letters said before I read them.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "There are six letters all together so far. Would you like to read them?", "input": "", "output": "It would certainly be helpful."}, {"instruction": "I have decided to allow you to read one letter a week, because you finally put a real lock on that door. And I have decided to allow you to read only one letter a week because you dared not to believe. I will give you the most recent letter first. You can read them backward chronologically.", "input": "", "output": "That would be fine, Ms. Gregory. I appreciate the fact that you trust me to read Matthew's letters. It would also be helpful if I could speak with Calvin. Do you think you could persuade him to make an appointment with me?"}, {"instruction": "No. He would never listen to me, never follow my advice. And even if he would come in, it wouldn't do anybody any good.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say that?"}, {"instruction": "Calvin doesn't speak anymore.", "input": "", "output": "At all?"}, {"instruction": "To my knowledge the man hasn't spoken anything at all, not as much as a grunt, to any man, woman, or child in more than five years.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Do you have any idea why?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right. I'll see you next week, okay?  That'd be August 29th at 2 pm."}, {"instruction": "Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Don't you want to know the other reason for my exuberance when I arrived today?", "input": "", "output": "Of course."}, {"instruction": "Because I'm getting close to cracking the code.", "input": "", "output": "The visitors' code?"}, {"instruction": "No. Silicon Impressions. I'm definitely getting somewhere on my mission. I'm beginning to decipher the first layers of the riddle. Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Ms. Gregory."}, {"instruction": "Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Hello, Ms. Gregory. Please come in. Have a seat."}, {"instruction": "If it's all the same to you, I'd prefer to stand.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Is something wrong?"}, {"instruction": "It's...I just.... The code. The Company. Matthew and Simon. There's too much going on. Too much dirt. And Calvin, of course. Like a film all over everything and no way to clean it. Always and forever there is Calvin.", "input": "", "output": "Well, let's just try to slow down and discuss it all one thing at a time."}, {"instruction": "But it's all happening at once! Don't you see? Don't you listen? It's all happening at once and that's exactly the problem. If I break it all down, cut it up, factor each element to the lowest common denominator, then try to splice it all together into some tenebrous simulacrum of verisimilitude, some hollow shadow of narrative, if I try to boil all the meat off the bone and suck out a linear marrow, all the truth will be lost as well in a dissipating steam shroud of diaphanous Helen. And what would be left then? Nothing more than the specter of light on a screen, meaningless gradients, filtered. And what would be left then? What would be left but a categorically organized collection of nothing? Oh no. My life, Doctor, is no chicken bone dried up for wishing. My thoughts are not film clips. And my mind is no moving picture.", "input": "", "output": "Well then, however you feel the need to express yourself will be fine. It would make my job much easier if you could at least slow down a little bit and try to take your time. I want to help but I have to understand."}, {"instruction": "Yes, yes. I know you do. Yes, I know. It's just that everything is all mixed up together and everything happens at once. I don't even know where to start.", "input": "", "output": "Is there anything specific that has been troubling you? You mentioned Calvin who we talked about last week.

Why don't we start with him?"}, {"instruction": "I'm afraid, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I think I have lost him.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "All the while he's been away I have felt him near me.

Are you aware of this?"}, {"instruction": "I am aware of everything. I can decipher almost every language known in this world. And I'm working on one that remains undiscovered.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you can try to explain for me why you feel compelled to speak in riddles?"}, {"instruction": "Why. Yes, there's that question. That tireless engine. Always and forever the road leads to Calvin.", "input": "", "output": "The riddles, Ms. Gregory. Why do you speak in riddles?"}, {"instruction": "Riddles are me, Doctor. They are all that I know. If you cut up and rearrange my numerous stories, if you try to compress all my layers onto one readable page, that is precisely what you would lose. Me. All of my marrow. \"What is Helen Gregory? What is she?\" you ask. An ultimate question. Enigma. Anomaly. Paradox. I am a riddle.", "input": "", "output": "We are all complicated people, Ms. Gregory. And very few of us ever feel that we truly understand ourselves. But what are you so afraid of? It's as if you're hiding behind a series of unanswerable questions. You are hiding from me, and most importantly, I think you are hiding from yourself."}, {"instruction": "You must try to understand me. Please. I have devoted my entire life to solving riddles and puzzles. Questions lead to clues just as clues lead to questions. Riddles are what the scholar, the detective, and the spy have in common. I am all of these, all three rolled into one. Please, please. Are you beginning to understand? Please, do we travel together? I live to assemble the strewn fragments of stories. And to search, of course. I live to search for things, including myself. But just because the questions themselves most intrigue me, I am not afraid of the answers. Answers are the goal, the resolution, the prize for the winner. So when I say that the riddle itself is the essence of Helen, I do not mean to imply that there is no resolution. But you are essentially correct in one of you assumptions. I am afraid. And I am essentially afraid of everything. But fear is another element all three of us share. Every good scholar, detective, and spy is afraid. Trust no one. Reveal no secrets. Steal, lie, and kill if you must. Have no compassion. There is no code of ethics. And there is no decorum.", "input": "", "output": "Let's try to refocus our attention on Matthew. I still don't understand why you're upset. You said something about how he's on the way home, I believe."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. That's correct. He's on his way home, but I can feel him drifting.", "input": "", "output": "Then, he's returning to this country?"}, {"instruction": "No, no. That's not what I meant at all. For years he's been slowly coming home to me, long before he ever left.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Let me try to explain it this way, Doctor. And please, listen closely. Like a jazz soloist releasing her mind's own ineffable and Castalian subsurface to articulate the sludge of her soul's watery bottom, I have let the boy go. He is my self, my language, and my greatest creation. I speak through him even now, having relinquished control. My son is my solo. He leads me each day on an improvisational journey through a labyrinth of notes in an unimaginable scale.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But yet, the farther he has wandered away from the tonic note, adding tension by degrees with each nuanced voicing, adding tension again and again adding tension, the farther he has wandered away from the home note of the scale, pushing tonality to the brink of atonality and flirting with ultimate disillusion, the farther he has strayed from the comfort of home, the more secure I have felt in the inevitability of his homecoming. In music, you see, tension demands resolution.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Did you know that I was once a musician?", "input": "", "output": "No I didn't.

What's wrong with Matthew?"}, {"instruction": "What's wrong with him?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "I'll tell you what's wrong with the boy. It's Calvin. Just like everything else. It all points to Calvin.", "input": "", "output": "Can you explain that further?"}, {"instruction": "If I am the home, and Matthew's my solo, then Calvin is the fifth degree. A magnet of absolute tension. Ever since the child was born, he's been pulling and pulling him away from home. Waking the poor boy at ridiculous hours with nothing more than an inarticulate grunt. And why? To take my child, my son out into the woods and teach him to fish and to hunt. To learn him to slaughter. All that inexcusable violence! And believe me, Doctor, that's not the half of it.", "input": "", "output": "Go on. Please continue."}, {"instruction": "It's as if the man's every thought, both waking and sleeping, is devoted to stealing my child from me.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say that?"}, {"instruction": "He has taken the boy out on his walks when I was out of the country. He has given the boy dirty books to read, filthy magazines, and lurid pictures. Pulling. Do you see? Always pulling my son away from me. And that's part of the reason, I admit, I sent him out of the country. So now he hides the letters, the voice of my child. He hides them because, for now, they represent all of his power.", "input": "", "output": "I see. But what do you mean, then, when you say that Matthew's \"on his way home?\" That he's beginning to favor you over Calvin?"}, {"instruction": "No. That's not it at all.

How do you know?\" I can read you too, Doctor. And though you have yet to ask, allow me to answer your questions. Matthew and Simon are soon to be lovers. I know this because I know my son and because I can read his letters.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. Calvin can read them as well. On the surface, that is. He is not an illiterate man. He simply chooses not to speak out of malevolence and spite. So, yes. He can read them, but he will never understand what has been written beneath the words in those letters, what has been written with something other than ink on the surface of paper. But I do understand them because of the simple and ineluctable fact that the hands that have touched those pages belong to my son. In this way I have beaten the man, and will continue to beat him until all of the clocks on the planet stop turning because inside me there is also a clock and perhaps it is with the face of this clock which sits in my belly that I am able to read all the words which are not printed in ink. And Calvin can't hear it ticking. That is how I have beaten him always already. And perhaps. Yes, yes. Perhaps that is it.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps what?"}, {"instruction": "Perhaps it is the beating itself, the insistence of victory that chains me to him as if I were always forced to fight, always fighting with my breast bared. Always and forever. As if in punishment for what I was given too long ago to remember. And I could easily beat all of the others. But with him there is something higher or larger that I am fighting. Yes. Something impalpable and transparent and inarticulate like destiny or fate or the word \"man\" itself. And if I am able finally to beat him, then I will have beaten them all. And I will beat them all finally, because now I know. I understand! See? An answer. An answer to that implacable engine! Tension and release. The home note. Resolution. You see? I'm not afraid of that, Doctor. I carry a magic spear. I wear impenetrable armor. Armor that even his eyes can't pierce, although he must know that I am something else. He must see that I am something else beneath all these layers of deception.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.

It will be thirteen years on the 12th of September.", "input": "", "output": "Does Calvin know about your relationship with Ruby?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. Yes, he knows. He followed me to a performance one night years ago, and then he followed us both back to Ruby's apartment. We made love in the garden that night. Oh! I still remember. My Ruby. My jewel. My garden flower.", "input": "", "output": "And how did Calvin react?"}, {"instruction": "He said nothing. He took pictures of us though and left them around the apartment so that I would know that he knew. But he said nothing about it. He said nothing at all.", "input": "", "output": "And Matthew? Does Matthew know as well?"}, {"instruction": "Of course he does. Didn't you even bother to read his letter?", "input": "", "output": "Yes I did. I read it. But I have to admit that I was perplexed and understood very little."}, {"instruction": "He knows. And he has known for longer than Calvin.", "input": "", "output": "Well, this has certainly been a provocative session, Ms. Gregory. I trust that I will see you next Thursday?"}, {"instruction": "That will be fine.", "input": "", "output": "At two?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, yes. Good afternoon to you too. Good afternoon.", "input": "", "output": "Would you care to sit down today, or would you feel more comfortable\nstanding again?"}, {"instruction": "I believe I'll sit. Yes, that would be fine. Doctor, may I\nask you a question?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, of course. What's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "It's very important that you respond with the utmost sincerity.\nI'll be able to tell if you're covering anything up.", "input": "", "output": "Of course. What is it?"}, {"instruction": "Has there been anyone in this office in the past week unattended\nby you?", "input": "", "output": "Why do you ask?"}, {"instruction": "Just answer the question, please. To your knowledge, has there\nbeen anyone in this room alone, other than yourself?", "input": "", "output": "Well, not to my knowledge, but what is this all about?"}, {"instruction": "And do you lock the office securely, with the dead-bolt, every\ntime you leave it?", "input": "", "output": "I believe so, but..."}, {"instruction": "And does anyone else have a key?", "input": "", "output": "Of course not."}, {"instruction": "And to your knowledge, is there any type of surveillance equipment\nin this room? Any bugs or wires?", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Gregory, I insist on knowing what..."}, {"instruction": "Answer the question. Please. It is extremely important to me.\nJust answer the question.", "input": "", "output": "Of course not."}, {"instruction": "I believe you. You speak the truth.", "input": "", "output": "Now, will you please explain to me what this is all about?"}, {"instruction": "I've discovered something terrible. This is all much larger\nthan I ever imagined. Too many people involved. Too many enemies.", "input": "", "output": "What are you talking about?"}, {"instruction": "The code. It's the code, Doctor. I'm afraid I may have cracked\nit.", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Gregory, I've been doing some thinking over the past couple\nof weeks. In reviewing my notes of our sessions together, your doodles,\nand Matthew's letter, it has become increasingly clear to me that you are\nin need of medication. Now, I suggested as much three weeks ago, but you\nemphatically refused."}, {"instruction": "Please hear me out. This is all coming to a head! Everything\nis happening at once, but I'm beginning to understand. You have to listen\nand believe. I need you. Please. You must believe me.", "input": "", "output": "I have been listening to you, but your symptoms of paranoia and\nconfusion haven't diminished. The medication will help you keep things in\nperspective."}, {"instruction": "You have to believe me. There is no one else. And to abandon\nme now, of all time's blanketry, when I need you the most.", "input": "", "output": "Why is now any different from 3 weeks ago?"}, {"instruction": "Because. I told you already everything's coming to a head.\nYou don't listen to me. Just like the boy. I'm losing you. You don't listen\nand you don't believe.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I'm listening now, Ms. Gregory. Why don't you tell me about\nwhat you mean when you say that everything's coming to a head."}, {"instruction": "I've cracked the code. It has taken me weeks because whoever\ninvented it is clearly very gifted at encryption, and knowledgeable about\nancient languages. If I'm correct in my research and assumptions, they were\nusing a cipher-based phonetic rendering of Gaelic.", "input": "", "output": "Who was? What code are you talking about?"}, {"instruction": "The code with which Silicon Impressions encrypts their communications.", "input": "", "output": "You're telling me that SII encodes all of their business correspondence\nin Gaelic?"}, {"instruction": "No. Not all of its correspondence. They have to keep up a\nsuccessful front. To the business world, they are simply one of the many\ncomputer firms based in the San Francisco Bay Area. But to the survivalists,\nmilitias, and domestic terrorists, they are something very different indeed.\nAnd to the intelligence community? The agency itself? Oh, methinks all is\nnot well, and I am afraid.", "input": "", "output": "This is exactly the type of paranoid delusion I was talking about\nearlier, Ms. Gregory. Now, I'm just going to write you out a prescription..."}, {"instruction": "Listen to me. I believe that Silicon Impressions is somehow\ninvolved in a massive conspiracy to overthrow the American Government. I'm\nnot saying the company itself is entirely responsible for spearheading this\noperation, nor am I insinuating that someone within SII, acting independently,\nis the mastermind behind the scheme. I don't yet know the names of those\ninvolved, or the depth of their involvement. But Doctor, you must suspend\nyour disbelief and listen. You must listen to me. You must listen to the\nsound of my voice and believe.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What makes you think this? Do you have any evidence?"}, {"instruction": "I have the documents, the code.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, of course. The code. Why don't you try to explain to me\nwhat the code is, and how you learned of it."}, {"instruction": "I...I don't know where to begin. Or when. I don't even know\nhow to begin.", "input": "", "output": "For my sake, Ms. Gregory, try to begin as far back as you can."}, {"instruction": "All right. I suppose the 4th of July is the most relevant place\nto begin, but everything is woven together. I couldn't possibly tell it\nall because I'd have to begin when I was two years old, or before. And even\nthen, there are so many holes in my version of the story. So many holes\nravaging the great tapestry in which the life of Helen is woven.", "input": "", "output": "Just to satisfy my curiosity, what happened when you were two\nyears old?"}, {"instruction": "That's where my memory begins. And it begins with the visitors.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Tell me about it. What do you remember?"}, {"instruction": "She was at her grandmother's farm. A great white house surrounded\nby a gentle sea of summer afternoon and squirming grasses. Helen was alone\nwhen they came to visit, the little men with owl's heads. She didn't see\nthem coming up the road or across the field. She didn't see them coming\nat all. They were just there. All around her. A group of them, faces gray\nas oatmeal, all around her, looking.", "input": "", "output": "And what happened then?"}, {"instruction": "Blackness. A sea of eventless nothing through which she floated\nfor no time at all. No duration. It was just night then, and tiny Helen\nall alone on the dirt road that approached the house. All alone. And so\nshe cried out a shrill scream of fear and loneliness swelling within her\nand the darkness swelling without. Never forget that feeling. The panic.\nThe night all over my skin. Frantic empty holes. The eyes. You could feel\nthem touching you.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What is the next thing you remember?"}, {"instruction": "Mother. She scooped up little Helen, felt her crying out in\nthe blackened night. To this day, I have no idea what became of that afternoon\nand evening. They vanished like objects. Slipped through the cracks. Or\nwhat became of Helen in between. I asked mother about it years later, but\nnobody who was there that day could remember a thing. Mother remembered\nhelping to make lunch. She remembered us eating. She remembered clearing\nthe dishes. And then nothing. She found herself crouched beneath the dining\nroom table, all in darkness, slowly realizing that it was night and that\nher Helen was missing.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But that's not significant. No. Not right now. There are too\nmany things you must know and too little time. About the 4th of July. About\nthe code. About Silicon Impressions. And most importantly, Doctor, there\nare things you must know about Calvin and Matthew.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Ms. Gregory. Please continue. What happened on the 4th\nof July?"}, {"instruction": "I overheard the message.", "input": "", "output": "The encoded message you've been talking about?"}, {"instruction": "It was...I don't know if I can explain it, but I think I overheard\nsomething the visitors let slip. A transmission of some kind, not intended\nfor me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean? Where did you overhear this transmission?"}, {"instruction": "In my mind's radio voice that connects me to the visitors.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And what was it exactly that you overheard?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it only lasted for a few seconds, just a tiny fragment\nof something larger. As if someone was turning the dials, searching for\nthe correct station, and they accidentally sent part of the message to me.", "input": "", "output": "What did you hear? What did the message say?"}, {"instruction": "\"Silicon Impressions.\" That was it. That was all\nI heard, the only two words. But what was beneath them. Oh! A strange feeling\nportentous of conspiracy, violence, and conflagration.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And this experience inspired you seek employment at SII?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. To find out what it meant. What the message was portending.\nAs I mentioned before, at night as I make my rounds, I look and listen.", "input": "", "output": "Have you discovered anything?"}, {"instruction": "I found a series of twenty-three electronic documents containing\nmore than fifteen megabytes of encrypted text.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "The code, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I understand."}, {"instruction": "I downloaded the files in the middle of the night and have\nspent nearly a month trying to read them. But I'm afraid I've found the\nanswer to the riddle.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "And it's just as I told you. From what I can tell, those files\ncontain intricate and meticulous instructions masterminding an enormous\nconspiracy against the American Government. It seems that the company, or\nsome individual within the company, has been using the available technology\nto disseminate information in an attempt to help coordinate survivalist\nand militia organizations and ultimately launch a grassroots-level revolt.\nIt's really quite terrifying.", "input": "", "output": "If this is true, Ms. Gregory, why are you telling me? Shouldn't\nyou be warning the proper authorities? Your ex-colleagues in the CIA perhaps?"}, {"instruction": "I can't.", "input": "", "output": "And why not?"}, {"instruction": "Because I don't yet know who's involved. The agency itself\nperhaps. And...", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "And my family.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I mean Calvin, Doctor. I have reason to believe that Calvin\nis involved in all of this.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you say that?"}, {"instruction": "I found his name mentioned in the files. Do you understand\nwhat this could mean?", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you tell me what you think it could mean."}, {"instruction": "That he has been...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "That he has been attempting to groom my son into some sort\nof...", "input": "", "output": "What?"}]
