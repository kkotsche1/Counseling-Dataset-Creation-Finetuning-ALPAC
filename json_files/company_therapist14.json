I'm sure you will try to be on time in\nthe future."}, {"instruction": "Yes, Doctor, I will. Thank you. Please, call me Cassie.\nEveryone does.", "input": "", "output": "Very well, Cassie, if it makes you more comfortable. I\nsee from your form that you have never been to a therapist before. If you\nhave any questions feel free to ask them at anytime, okay? Now, what brings\nyou into the office today?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I am not sure really. I had heard that SII signed\nup a new doctor, and I guess there have been some things on my mind lately.\nMaybe I shouldn't even be here.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Why don't we start by discussing what has been on your\nmind?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I am very frustrated lately. You see, I work as\nan executive assistant at SII, but it's really just a means to make money\nwhile I pursue my real goal--to be an actress. I have been taking classes\nsince I was, like, 8 or 9 years old. Hollywood has always fascinated\nme. Can you imagine living in those times? The golden age of the cinema.\nFred and Ginger waltzing across the big screen, Vivien Leigh and 'Gone With\nThe Wind', Casablanca.", "input": "", "output": "What is it about acting and those films that intrigue\nyou?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess the style, the romance, the way anything\ncould and did happen. And dreams came true in this grand way. They were\nlarger than life.", "input": "", "output": "So tell me, what are you doing to pursue your dream of\nbeing an actress?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I haven't been doing everything I should. I mean,\nI don't have an agent. I started going to these acting classes--actually,\nit's this acting improvisational troupe. I really like going there, but\nit's so hard on me.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well to start off, my boyfriend is not very happy with\nme and the acting thing. He thinks it's ridiculous because it is so\nhard to make a living at it. And in the meantime, I could be building a\n\"real\" career. He wants to get more serious with me, but wants\nto make sure that I can be a productive bread winner. And I think he\nis jealous.", "input": "", "output": "Jealous? How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, for one thing, I think it's because I am very busy,\nso we have less time together. Plus there are men in the group, and sometimes\nwe have to do love scenes. I've told him its just acting, pretending,\nand its part of my \"job.\" But he gets furious. He won't\neven discuss it anymore.", "input": "", "output": "How is your relationship with him besides the acting?"}, {"instruction": "Well...good, I guess. We met in college, and have been\ndating ever since then. I do really like him, maybe even love him, but...he\ncan be kind of demanding at times.", "input": "", "output": "How do you mean, demanding?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we always do what he wants to do. Except romantically.", "input": "", "output": "What happens romantically?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if I can discuss this. I mean, I am a\nlittle embarrassed and uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. This is only our first session and it's normal\nto take some time to develop a level of trust between us. Hopefully we'll\nbe able to explore troubling areas more deeply as time progresses. In the\nmeantime, I think it would help you to keep a journal. A place that you\ncan fully express yourself, whenever you feel like it. How does that sound?"}, {"instruction": "I already keep a journal. It's something I learned\nto do in acting classes, explore the unconscious and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I think this will help you with other aspects of\nlife as well."}, {"instruction": "Do I have to bring it with me every week?", "input": "", "output": "That is up to you. The journal is a tool to assist you\nin monitoring your feelings. What bothers you, what makes you happy, and\nso forth. Then, at a later time, you can go back and reflect on what transpired,\nor remind yourself how you handled a situation and how you can best handle\nit if the problem resurfaces. If you would like to bring it in to discuss\nor as a basis for discussion, then by all means, do so. I also like to read\nthem because they give me some insight into who you are. But if you feel\nuncomfortable about my reading your journal, that's perfectly okay too.\nEven if the journal is just for you to read, I'm sure you'll find it valuable."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I'm afraid our session is a bit abbreviated this\ntime. So I'll see you in a week. Let's see, that's July 30th at 1 o'clock.\nOkay?"}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor. I'm on time for this visit.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I noticed; even a little early. Do you tend to have\ntrouble keeping appointments?"}, {"instruction": "No. I tend to be an early bird of sorts. I mean,\nI like to be prepared for things. I guess I am a little neurotic\nthat way. Sorry I was late last time. I was just...I guess, nervous about\ncoming here.", "input": "", "output": "As I said last time, hopefully you will become more comfortable\nwith the therapy process as time goes on. Of course, therapy is very personal.\nIt may be that I am not the right person for you to be talking to."}, {"instruction": "I think it was just my own preconceptions of what therapy\nis, like I am a loony or something.", "input": "", "output": "You seem a little more at ease, though, and that's good.\nWhy don't you tell me how your week was?"}, {"instruction": "It was okay, I suppose. Just same old, same old. I\nam a little more frustrated with the people at SII. They treat me like such\na flake sometimes. And it is just so unfair! I work just as hard as\nthe next guy. I have a college diploma that I worked hard for. Just because\nI'm pursuing an acting career, doesn't mean I didn't study other things.\nI have a freakin' minor in business technology operations, for heaven's\nsakes! I know more about what's going on in there than most of them do.\nJust 'cause I am a pretty face doesn't mean I don't have a brain, too.", "input": "", "output": "What is it that they do that upsets you?"}, {"instruction": "They piss me off! I am so fed up with everyone's\ncrap! My family is giving me shit on the \"not settling into a respectable\ncareer\" line, Brian is bitching out of both sides of his mouth, my\nemployers don't give me the respect I deserve. What the heck does everyone\nwant from me? Sheesh!", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you take a deep breath, and we can work one\nat a time on these pressures and annoyances, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I suppose you are right.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, let's tackle one problem at a time. Have you spoken\nto anyone at work regarding your treatment there?"}, {"instruction": "No. I don't know what to say, who to say it to, even.\nThey are my superiors, so they can do whatever they want, and I just\nhave to take it.", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think it would be perfectly acceptable for you\nto air you feelings? Perhaps they don't realize how valuable you are to\nthe company, or don't realize they are upsetting you."}, {"instruction": "I guess I could talk to my immediate supervisor, see what\nshe says. I am not just a glorified secretary, I really do much more there.", "input": "", "output": "I am sure. And that is the type of thing you should discuss\nwith your supervisor."}, {"instruction": "I guess so.", "input": "", "output": "You seem reluctant."}, {"instruction": "I need the job. I need it to survive, make rent, pay\nfor the groceries. I don't have the time or energy to go out and find another\njob. And I don't think I could handle the waitressing deal. I'd be too exhausted\nto pursue my acting, and perform in Winging It.", "input": "", "output": "Well, ultimately it's your decision. Perhaps in your journal...you\nare still keeping one, yes? Perhaps you can make a list of pros and cons\nfor making such a move. For instance, not saying anything means you must\nlearn to cope with how you are treated there. Saying something may put your\njob in some jeopardy. Do you see what I am getting at here?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, it's a good idea.", "input": "", "output": "You can bring in the listing if you would like. We can\neven do a role play exercise if you'd like."}, {"instruction": "You know, I never thought of it that way. I can create\na character and use it as a shield. Of course, that can backfire, but\nit would take the pressure off of me, either way. I don't know. I think\nI will start with a list of pro and cons.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Now, about Brian. You mentioned last time that he\ncan be demanding, and tends to get his way. Would you care to elaborate?"}, {"instruction": "Brian was my first real boyfriend. He was pretty\nsupportive of me during college. Things seemed simpler back then. He now\nworks for an accounting company. I don't know, it almost seems as if\nhe lost his imagination and creativity. He is so into preparing for the\nfuture, buying into the corporate image.", "input": "", "output": "Has this affected your relationship, do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. In acting classes, I once played a woman\nwho went for 'father-image' type of boyfriends. I thought to myself, I never\nwant to be like that. I think people should be together because they truly\nlove each other and enjoy their company. And even though I would go to Brian\nfor advice during school, I didn't think I was dependent on him or anything.\nAnd I made my own decisions. Now he gets all pissy when I don't do what\nhe wants. And to avoid any arguments and stuff, I tend to just go\nalong with what he wants. I mean, if it means we don't have to fight,\nwhat difference does it make if we have Chinese instead of Italian for dinner?", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel you are losing any integrity at all when you\ngo along with his wishes?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I don't think I ever thought about it that way. I\nreally don't think it has anything to do about my integrity, actually. Like,\nhe wants to advance our physical relationship, and I won't let him.", "input": "", "output": "You did mention last time that he can be demanding romantically."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess I might as well tell you. I mean, this is\nall confidential and stuff. I read up on doctor-patient relationships.", "input": "", "output": "Of course. What you tell me is between you and I only."}, {"instruction": "Well, I am a virgin. Nothing to be ashamed of, right?\nI don't think I can commit to him my entire body and soul if he can't commit\nto me entirely. A couple of months ago, he got kind of aggressive when\nwe were making out. Made me very uncomfortable. Then carried on when\nI pulled away. He said I was abnormal. Okay, I admit, it may be rare for\nsomeone 24 to still be a virgin, but that doesn't mean I am abnormal. He\nsaid that he couldn't understand how I can make out \"hot and heavy\"\non stage with people I hardly know, but won't get more intimate with him.\nLike I owe him something. And the thing is, had he not made such a big deal,\nand let me warm up to the idea, I probably would have given in. I\nmean, I am very curious. About sex. This girl in my class, Erica, she said\nshe was up for a role in a big movie, it was for a prostitute. So she slept\nwith some guy to see what is was like and to get into character. I don't\nthink I would go that far, but to be a good actress, I do need to experience\nthings. But I wouldn't do it just to do it, like Erica did.", "input": "", "output": "How do you really feel about Brian? Are you physically\nattracted to him?"}, {"instruction": "Do you mean do I think he's sexy? I guess so. I mean...he\nis very attractive. I don't know. I think maybe I am not very happy with\nhim recently. I guess that affects my physical feelings towards him. What\ndo you think, doctor?", "input": "", "output": "It can and probably does affect how you feel about him.\nBesides Brian, have you dated much?"}, {"instruction": "I dated very casually in high school, then met Brian almost\nright away in college. Since then, I have pretty much been with him.", "input": "", "output": "And he with you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I think so. Why would you ask?", "input": "", "output": "Has he been faithful during the entire time?"}, {"instruction": "He better have been! I'd chop his nuts off if I found\nout he was sleeping around while trying to get me into bed!", "input": "", "output": "Do you really think you would react so violently?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'd probably just cry for days.", "input": "", "output": "Getting back to your feelings toward Brian, do you see yourself\nhaving sex with him in the future?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure I can answer that.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have sexual fantasies?"}, {"instruction": "I really don't think I can discuss this right now. I think\nI would prefer writing it down then talking about it face to face. You know,\nit isn't prudishness actually. To be quite frank, I could talk with\nyou explicitly about sex and doing it--make you blush, probably. But I'd\nbe doing it as a character and not really me. Is there some way we can\ndo this in writing?", "input": "", "output": "Hmmm. I am glad you acknowledge that inherent risk of\nhiding behind the theatrical mask. Well, why don't you try to write something\nand leave it for me here at my office before our next session. Then I can\nhave a look at it and we can take it from there. Does that work for you?"}, {"instruction": "I think that's an excellent idea.", "input": "", "output": "Our time is almost up. I've scheduled an appointment for\nyou next week at this time. Let's see, that's August 6th at 1 pm.\nAnd if you need to talk to me before that time, always feel free to give\nme a call."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, doctor. And thank you for being understanding\nand patient with me.", "input": "", "output": "Of course, Cassie. And I want you to think about ways\nto improve the situation at work, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "I am glad you got it. I wasn't sure about leaving it under\nthe door, but figured it would be okay. I have to admit, I was kind of\nnervous about coming here today. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Nervous? How so?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't really know how things would go, especially after\ntelling you about all the illness stuff. You know, they sent me to plenty\nof psychiatrists, to see if I was crazy, because they didn't know what was\nwrong with me, didn't believe me or all the symptoms I was experiencing.\nExcuse me, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, of course. There's a box of tissues to your\nleft. Take a deep breath...whenever you're ready, we can continue."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor. Sorry I broke down like that.", "input": "", "output": "Quite all right. Do you have a primary care practitioner,\nCassie?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes, I guess. I really don't like going to doctors\nany more. I was assigned someone under SII's HMO plan. I've seen him\nabout a dozen or so times since he became part of the panel. He gives me\nsome medication for my allergies, and something for my stomach.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you take something for your stomach?"}, {"instruction": "It goes back to when I was younger. Like, right after\nI had that infection-- the yeast infection. These specialists put me\non huge doses of anti-inflammatory drugs to help ease the pain in my joints.\nWell, my stomach wasn't all that great to begin with, but after that, it\nwas horrid. I remember when I was 15 years old, I cried myself to sleep\nalmost every night.", "input": "", "output": "Cassie, if you don't mind, I would like to contact your\ncurrent physician and take a look at your records. Would that be acceptable\nto you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I guess so. He doesn't know very much about this\nchronic illness thing. When I started going to him for help, I would occasionally\ntell him of my complaints, and he offers me different options for treating\neach symptom. Been there, done that.", "input": "", "output": "Does he have all of your medical records? Your medical\nhistory?"}, {"instruction": "No, the previous doctor has most of it. I can get you\nhis name and number if you wish to speak to him, but I really don't want\nSII to know any of this. It could cost me my job!", "input": "", "output": "I understand, and yes, I would like to contact your previous\nphysician. Why don't we change the subject for a bit. Tell me, how was your\nweek otherwise?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. I had plans to see Brian Saturday night, but\nhad to cancel. I felt so sick all day long, and threw up a couple of\ntimes. I just couldn't see putting on make-up and getting all pretty and\nthen putting on the act of having fun and like everything is okay, fine\nand dandy. My bones and muscles were so achy, which makes me irritable.\nAnyway, we got into a fight over our plans. He thought I was canceling for\nanother reason. Friday night I had a workshop with \"Winging It\",\nand he came to see me. At first, I was glad to see him there. When it\nwas my turn at bat, the audience had me as a flirty woman trying to get\nout of a ticket from a cop. The guy I was playing against, Tony, he and\nI have done scenes together before. He is a real sweetheart and knows how\nto get the scene done without getting too personal, if you know what I mean.\nSo right away, Brian thought it was because I was seeing Tony Saturday\nnight instead of him. So, of course, we got into a whole long discussion\nabout acting and just pretending, that it doesn't necessarily mean anything.\nThen I tried to tell him I was just tired from a long week, but he said,\n\"I am tired too, we can do something low key.\" Hey, I was lucky\nto get out of bed and reheat leftovers, I was so out of it! There was just\nno way I could be human that evening, forget sociable. I think he was\npretty pissed at me. We didn't talk again until Monday, and we normally\ntalk every day.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Brian would be more understanding if you\nexplained your illness and fatigue to him?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I mean, what would I tell him? I don't know\nwhat's wrong with me, how can I explain it to him?", "input": "", "output": "Cassie, maybe we should work on finding the origin of this\ndisease or ailment that troubles you."}, {"instruction": "How? Do you know how many stupid medical tests and\nexams I have taken? I have had more blood drawn than all of Dracula's\nvictims combined. I have swallowed radio transmitters to detect how my stomach\ndigests food. I took MRIs when they were still considered Nuclear Magnetic\nResonators, NMRs. Truly, I am so sick and tired of being treated like the\nhuman guinea pig! Or \"try this diet, and eliminate that from your life,\ntake this supplement\"...gross! And it solves nothing or even makes\nme worse! Instead, these pompous idiots come back and shrug their shoulders,\nor insinuate that I am doing illicit drugs, or suffering from a bad abortion,\nor some other idiotic asinine excuse for their lack of knowledge! Damn it!", "input": "", "output": "I can see this pains you. Perhaps a review of your records\nwould help. I have a good friend at the University who specializes in rare\ndiseases, we can start there if you wish. Let's talk about the yeast\ninfection you had when you were younger. To your knowledge, have you\nhad an infection since?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't think so. I haven't been to another gynecologist\nsince then. I know I should go, especially now that I am older and will\nprobably be sexually active.", "input": "", "output": "Then why not go?"}, {"instruction": "Well, first, I hate, I mean, despise going to doctors.\nThey can be very judgmental, and its something I do not appreciate. Second,\nI guess it's something I am not really ready to deal with.", "input": "", "output": "What is it you are not ready to deal with?"}, {"instruction": "The implications. What they may find, what they might\nsay, having to tell Brian about all this. What if he doesn't believe\nme that I am a virgin and didn't get it through sexual activity? He may\nthink I have other diseases too, especially since I am not exactly the healthiest\nperson in the world.", "input": "", "output": "What other diseases? You mean sexual disease?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think I have anything, per se. I know I haven't\nbeen exposed to HIV. I don't use illicit drugs, I've never engaged in sexual\nactivity with another person, never had a blood transfusion, that pretty\nmuch rules that out. But I know there is something terribly wrong with my\nbody, and I don't know what it is or how to fix it. I feel like I am trapped.\nPlease forgive me for crying so much. It's so frustrating and I don't know\nwhat to do.", "input": "", "output": "What would you like to do?"}, {"instruction": "I would like to feel better, have a normal life.", "input": "", "output": "I have been doing some thinking about all of this. Have\nyou been tested for Lyme disease, mono, or Epstein Barr?"}, {"instruction": "Lyme disease, yes. I even met with the top specialist,\nand this was all way before Lyme was well known by the general public.\nI had borderline results when my general practitioner tested for it. The\nspecialist retested me in his lab and said I do not have it. But they said\nthere is obviously something plaguing me. So, that was that. Never been\ntested for mono. I have heard that Epstein Barr is very common\nin adults, but when I was tested for that the results were negative.", "input": "", "output": "You seem to know an awful lot of medical terminology and\nprotocol."}, {"instruction": "I guess I have had to rely on myself for health care in\nmany ways. I take an \"inventory\" of my health every day and try\nto see what is better or worse on any given day.", "input": "", "output": "That is good, you should be proud of yourself. I hope\nyou are recording your observations in your journal--that kind of information\ncan be very helpful to your doctors. You have taken an active role in your\nhealth, and that is very important. It's true that physicians in general\nare better at treating one disorder that is well understood than diagnosing\nsomething unusual and perhaps compound from a whole range of symptoms. How\nhas your family handled it all?"}, {"instruction": "They have been really good about it and support me in\nmany ways. The main reason I moved to the Bay Area was to stay close\nto them. They really wanted to live up here, and they knew I couldn't make\nit without their help. So we all moved. They call on a regular basis to\ncheck up on me, and have a woman come in to clean the house, straighten\nup, and prepare some food for me to reheat when I am doing poorly. But they\nalso respect my need for independence, which is nice.", "input": "", "output": "Good. And your friends, do they know about it?\nDo you have other support mechanisms?"}, {"instruction": "My high school best friend knows. She is really\nsweet. But she now lives in New York City. We both wanted to be actresses\ngrowing up, but she wanted to conquer Broadway, while I desired the silver\nscreen. Other than that, no. I don't know what to tell people. An ex-friend\nonce said to me, \"Cassie, what's wrong with you?\" in such a nasty\ndemeaning way, simply because I had to cancel plans at the last minute a\nfew times. People just don't understand, unless you can say you have\nsome specific ailment--say AIDS or Cancer or Arthritis and suddenly they\nbecome empathetic again. It is so aggravating!", "input": "", "output": "Unfortunately, our time is up. I think the key is to get\na handle on this physical ailment. I am anxious to be able to get your complete\nmedical file from your previous physicians and psychiatrists. There are\nsome physical conditions which sometimes look like psychiatric ailments.\nThose have to be ruled out prior to making an appropriate medical diagnosis.\nI am also going to want you to consider seeing another doctor, an internist.\nI will try to make a referral within the HMO. Let me do some research\non all this, but I'm going to need a little time. Could you gather the name\nand address information about your previous physicians and either fax it\nto me or slip it under my door? And I'm going to need you to sign this medical\nauthorization form that will allow your other doctors to transfer the records\nto me."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll try to get all that together. You'll forgive\nme if it takes me a while. I haven't really being feeling very strong lately.\nAll my energy is spent trying to do my job.", "input": "", "output": "Of course I understand. I will see you next week, same time.\nThat'll be Tuesday, August 13 at 1 pm. And of course if you need\nto speak to me before then you know how to contact me."}, {"instruction": "Not particularly, though I have been going to work again. I just crash at night. I spoke to the leader of Winging It; I don't want them to depend on me for a performance if I can't make it. I just told them I have family responsibilities that I must attend to. Really bums me out, but I don't know what else to do. I think Ms. Bows was slightly upset with me for calling in sick last week. She gave me the cold front for awhile. I guess work really piled up while I was gone. You'd think they would realize how much I do around here and show some appreciation. But no such luck.", "input": "", "output": "I am glad you're able to get back to work. Did you get a chance to speak with Dr. Halsey?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I have an appointment to see him next week. I wanted to get an appointment late in the day, so I don't have to take off work, and he was pretty booked up. He seems nice enough, and that is such a relief!! Are you certain that SII won't be able to get any of the information that I tell him. I can't afford to lose my job or my health insurance.", "input": "", "output": "SII has the right to find out that you're seeing him, and any diagnosis that he makes, but there is always the doctor-patient confidentiality that you can rely on.

He called one day, I can't remember when it was exactly. Anyway, he was very upset because I had to cancel plans again, and he thought I was doing something suspicious. I just started crying and crying. Well, he wound up coming over that night, and he held me, comforted me. I tried to tell him that I just wasn't doing very well, physically. He said he didn't realize that I had been ill, and wanted to know more about what was going on with me. I really wasn't able to talk much more about it, but I was glad to get some of it out in the open. He stayed the night with me, which was nice.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "We were up late talking and then crashed on the living room floor. It was sweet and nice. And he didn't make any stupid comments about having sex. Or not having it, rather. It was the first time in a long while that we didn't argue a lot; and we actually talked about stuff. Meaningful things. It was like when we first started going out.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you're starting to open up to Brian. He is understanding about your fatigue?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. I was even thinking of asking him to come with me to see this new doctor. Since I really hate doing these things, it would be nice to have the moral support. And maybe he would get some insight into all this. Of course, it is possible that he freaks out and then dumps me.", "input": "", "output": "Either way, don't you think it will be better to know how he deals with your realities? You haven't told him your entire medical history yet."}, {"instruction": "No, not everything. Especially not about the yeast infection. That would be like opening Pandora's Box, I think. Even though I told him before that I'm a virgin, I don't think he really believes me--that I've never been intimate with a guy before.", "input": "", "output": "I really don't think that the yeast infection is a very significant part of your medical history.  It doesn't indicate sexual activity at all.  Really, yeast infections can strike very young girls.  I've even heard about newborn babies having yeast infections.  And yours has cleared up completely years ago if I remember properly.  In fact, they're so common that you can now buy over the counter treatments for them and the cream is advertised heavily on television.  Your medical history is complex and you have really been suffering for years.  But you can set your mind to rest about the yeast infection part."}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I was so ashamed of having to go to a gynecologist, I guess I've always associated the yeast infection with a sexual disease.  You know, I spoke with Michelle last week.  You remember, she's been really a good friend since high school, letting me lean on her proverbial shoulder when times are tough. And she can make me laugh no matter how low I am. She's met Brian, and thinks he is nice and all, but I think she would like to see me with someone else.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he can be impatient at times, and she knows I need a little more patience and nurturing than the average person. There was one time.... We went on an overnight trip together and her family, and I got sick in the car. We were probably like 16 years old. She stood with me beside the road, holding my head as I puked up breakfast. It's almost funny thinking back on it. Anyway, we have always been more like sisters than just friends.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Brian would hold your head when you are ill?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I'd like to think so. He hates hypochondriacs and hates anything to do with sick things. Odd, isn't it? That of all the people I could be involved with, I chose someone who doesn't deal well with illness.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think he feels this way about sickness? Did you feel this about him when you started dating?"}, {"instruction": "I had no idea. He seemed so sweet, so I had no reason to conclude otherwise. I found out when his uncle fell ill. He said his uncle would whine all the time, and really wasn't as sick as he claimed. Brian comes from the \"bite your lower lip and get on with it\" school of life. And there are many more clich\u00e9s where that came from!", "input": "", "output": "And yet you said he seemed supportive this week."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Doctor, do you think I can ask him join me in a session with you, to tell him about things. Maybe if there is another person present...I don't know. I told Michelle it would be easier to get over him and just start from the beginning again, this time telling the guy up-front. Though, why can't there be a beginning again when I tell Brian? It's all this thinking that gets me so frustrated! I hate feeling sick. I hate not being able to have a normal life, do things like other people do. Tell me, do you think this new doctor will figure out what is wrong with me? If I could just know what is going on inside my body--how to fix it. It would be such a relief!", "input": "", "output": "I think seeing him would certainly be a step in the right direction. Let's see what he says. I have nothing against you bringing Brian to a session. However, I think you need to talk with him first. I'm happy with the direction that you're headed in your relationship.  Sharing your experience this week with him was a good first step. And, if it seems too much all at one time, don't feel the need to tell him everything all at once."}, {"instruction": "That makes sense. I guess I feel like all this is building up inside of me and when I let a little out, I am going to explode. How do I remain rational, explaining and providing information, when it's such an emotional subject for me?", "input": "", "output": "There is no reason to hide your feelings from him, Cassie. In fact, it is important that he knows how sensitive you are. This way, you both can determine if he can meet your needs as well as how he copes with your limitations."}, {"instruction": "I guess I am afraid of sounding like a cry-baby. Sheeesh! This is like having to take off a Band-Aid. It's best to rip it off quick. But you know it's going to hurt, so the temptation is to pull it off slowly. Do some, take a rest, do some, take a rest, and so forth.  It's just too much.", "input": "", "output": "Do what's most comfortable. You don't have to plan it all out. Let it flow and be comfortable with it. If he really does care for you, as it seems he does, then he'll be supportive and allow you time. I am sure he will have many questions. Try to remember that he is trying to understand the situation, not questioning you. If you need to cry, then cry. Let him see who you really are."}, {"instruction": "Oh, man. This is going to be so hard for me. Okay, I can do this. I've done tougher things in my life, right?", "input": "", "output": "Positive thinking is always helpful. And you are correct. I am sure it is much harder to hide your illness and pretend there is nothing wrong, then to share what ails you. Good luck with it. And if you need to talk to me, remember that you can always call."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, our time is up for this week.  Our next session is a week from today.  That's Tuesday, August 27th at 1 pm.  Does that work for you, Cassie?"}, {"instruction": "That's fine, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good, I'll see you next week then. Bye, Cassie and good luck."}, {"instruction": "Not so good, Doctor. Yesterday, I almost fainted in front of my boss, and today I totally messed up on a project. I feel so stupid. On top of feeling so sick. Ugh.", "input": "", "output": "Everyone makes mistakes. Why don't you tell me what happened--with the fainting as well as the work."}, {"instruction": "Well, yesterday I just felt really sick. Everyday it gets harder and harder for me to get things done. It's so odd. I always believed pushing myself, trying to snap out of it, is the best thing to do, but that doesn't seem to do it for me anymore. It's like at the end of the day, I feel like I need 12 hours of sleep to be able to function the following day. But I don't get refreshed, nor do I get the amount of sleep I need, for one reason or another, and then the following night I need 12 plus hours of sleep. It seems impossible to catch up. I spent the whole weekend in bed, sleeping and resting. Didn't even leave the apartment or get dressed. Anyway, about the fainting--I almost called in sick yesterday, but figured I shouldn't. I guess my body got over-loaded, because I collapsed. I was talking with Ms. Bows and I got very flushed and dizzy. Luckily, I was able to excuse myself and went to the restroom. As soon as I got inside, I slid to the floor. So, I threw some cool water on myself and rested in one of the stalls for a few minutes, then staggered back to my desk. It was towards the end of the day, so I thought I could hang instead of leaving early and arousing suspicion. Today, I was asked to... well, do some number crunching, basically. I totally messed up--inverted columns and rows, all sorts of stupid mistakes. I almost felt retarded. I couldn't think of the right words to describe things. It was like I was in a fog or my brain was moving in slow motion.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I'm concerned about the fainting spell. Incidentally, I got a message on my service from Dr. Halsey and he said that he'd be sending me a note soon. If you have no objections, I'd like to discuss this with him. Is this new or have you suffered from this before?"}, {"instruction": "A couple of years ago, before college, this happened almost all the time. Then it seemed to fade away a bit. But it has come back recently. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I feel like whatever it is, it's gotten worse and it scares me.", "input": "", "output": "Of course, I understand. Tell me, what did you think of Dr. Halsey?"}, {"instruction": "He was so very nice, kind, gentle, and sweet. Not like the usual bunch of characters. No offensive, Doctor. You've been an exception to my doctor rule as well. He took my history, and some blood. Said he may run some more tests, but first he wants to discuss my case with an infectious disease doctor friend of his. It was cool, he didn't push his ideas onto me, but instead absorbed what I was saying and was willing to look into it. He also attempted to contact my previous physician to get my records, but they are being quite reluctant. My mom's friend says they have had some malpractice trouble and that may be why.", "input": "", "output": "I am glad things went well with Dr. Halsey."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I am very relieved.", "input": "", "output": "How are things with Brian?"}, {"instruction": "Same shit, different day. Oh, please excuse my French. When I feel crummy, I tend to let the curses flow as they may. Anyway, I didn't see Brian this weekend. We spoke on the phone for awhile on Saturday. He really wanted to go to this jazz club. I told him I felt really ill, like flu-ish, with headaches, chills, the whole bit. So a noisy and crowded club was not sounding fun to me. He got a bit pissy about it. Tried to guilt me into going. That totally ticked me off, and I gave it to him but good. I said, \"Did you totally forget the conversation we had last week? I try to open up to you and it goes in one ear and out the other.\" I was proud for asserting myself. We argued. He said he could come over and \"pat\" me. I knew that meant he was going to try to get some action. He's done that before. On top of it all, he practically invited himself over for dinner which, of course, I should cook. I am the woman, after all, right? Sheeesh. I simply said, \"No thank you.\" Then he threatened me.  Threatened me that he would go to this nightclub without me if I didn't spend time with him. I told him to go. Have fun. He didn't go. At least, that was what he told me the following day. Why should I do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants? It was a good thing not to see him. I think the break was well needed.", "input": "", "output": "Does that mean you didn't ask him to go with you to see Dr. Halsey?"}, {"instruction": "I thought about it for the longest time. And, after much trepidation, I asked if he could drop me off at the Doctor's office. Figured, if he was interested in what was going on with me--why I needed to see a doctor, et cetera--he would ask. Then I would take it from there. He said he didn't think he could get off work, but would try if I wanted. I decided to just forget it. I don't want to be too dependent on him anyway. I don't want to be too dependent on anyone. That just sucks. Feeling like you owe people for helping you out all the time.", "input": "", "output": "Good friends often really like to help out when you need it."}, {"instruction": "I know. Gosh, if it were the other way around, I would have taken him! Whatever. Oh! I spoke to Michelle the other day. She is coming to California later this month to visit. Actually, it's for business--a convention. The convention will be in town, so I offered for her to stay here. Instead, she said she is getting a suite, courtesy of her company, in a very pish-posh hotel. With an expense account. So, she is going to pick me up, and we will do a girlie thing together. Facials, stay up all night and talk, that kind of thing. I can't wait!", "input": "", "output": "Something for you to look forward to."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I told her about the new doctor. She said it sounds like this one may actually come up with something. She was telling me of something she read in the paper, this doctor who helps with assisted suicides. He helped this one woman kill herself recently and the symptoms sounded very similar to mine. She begged me not to do anything like that. The way she spoke about it, this woman, it was so eerie. Anyway, I told her that I definitely would not do anything drastic like that. I have lost too much of my life already. I want to enjoy as much of it as I can.", "input": "", "output": "That's a healthy attitude. Did she recall what the illness was?"}, {"instruction": "She couldn't remember off the top of her head, but said she would look through the paper and send me the article. I don't read the paper myself anymore. Too many bad things. It seems they only report on all the terrible events--catastrophes and such. I don't need that kind of crap. I'd rather be amused and get my mind off my problems. Like renting a movie or something. Though I haven't done that in ages.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "It really is a pain in the butt. You have to schlepp to the video store, hope to get the movie you want to see, then schlepp home. After watching it, you have to make sure you get the video tape, rewound, of course, back to the store, in the time period allocated. If I can't get back out, then it gets costly to pay for an extra day. I know that sounds like I am being lazy. And that isn't it at all. But when I feel sick, I don't want to move. Or sometimes I can't move. Besides, I have cable. They play plenty of movies to keep me occupied.", "input": "", "output": "Does that upset you, that you may sound like you are just being lazy?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, it does. I love taking long walks, but haven't been able to in the longest time. I would love to get out and do things, but I just can't. I do push myself, maybe more than I should, but that seems to make me worse. I heard someone in the office the other day bitching and moaning about having to visit friends and family. It is such a drag and so depressing to hear that. I would love to be able to visit people every weekend. I would love to be able to complain about having to do these things. But I guess that is just not my lot in life, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Well, perhaps not at this moment, but things do change. Let's see what Dr. Halsey comes up with."}, {"instruction": "I'd love to get a good night's sleep, for a change.", "input": "", "output": "I'm reluctant to prescribe medication for you without having a better understanding of what's happening with you physically."}, {"instruction": "I hate taking pills anyway. I react weird to things. But maybe they could help me to get some sleep. I would kill for that!", "input": "", "output": "Okay, why don't you give me a call later this week, and let me know how you are doing. In the meantime, I'll check with Dr. Halsey. If you still feel like you're not sleeping properly, I may try you on something very gentle. How does that sound?"}, {"instruction": "It sounds fair enough.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I'll speak to you then.  And I'll see you the same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "That's fine, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, that's right after the Labor Day weekend on September 3rd at 1 pm."}, {"instruction": "Okay, and I'll speak to you later this week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Cassie."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good day, Cassie. How are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess. Well, not really. I am a mess, a walking disaster area. I feel terribly sick and achy. I didn't make it into work today. I almost canceled our appointment.  But if I had to sit all alone in my apartment feeling like this, I would be crying hysterically. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I'm terribly exhausted, but I can hardly sleep. I have trouble walking because of the pains in my joints, muscles, and skin. I'm terribly uncomfortable standing still, sitting, and lying down. I have chills and hot flashes. I'm falling apart at the seams!", "input": "", "output": "The tissues are on the table beside you, if you want them. Take a deep breath and we'll go on."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'm sorry for crying like this. I don't know who else to turn to. You've been so good to me and I really appreciate it.", "input": "", "output": "That's what I'm here for. Don't beat yourself up for not feeling well."}, {"instruction": "I'm so scared to lose my job. How will I support myself? Did you hear about SII's medical reviews? They are looking into people's files or something. It can't look all that well that I am seeing a psychiatrist, and now an internist, plus missing work so regularly. What am I going to do?", "input": "", "output": "Take each moment as it comes, one problem at a time. We are here to try to help you work things out."}, {"instruction": "Have you ever heard of Serenity Prayer?", "input": "", "output": "\"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things that I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\" Is that the one?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, that's it. Sometimes I just feel like giving up to a higher power. But it's one of those things that are easier said than done. It's so unfair! Life was not supposed to be this way! I worked hard to get where I am and I'm a good person.  So why is everything so messy, so difficult? I don't understand.  And if I don't understand, how the hell am I supposed to accept it?", "input": "", "output": "It's important for you to come to terms with the fact that you have an illness, and a disabling one at that. Do you think you can ultimately accept that?"}, {"instruction": "If I knew what was wrong with me then yes, I think I could accept it.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you'll feel better after you have been properly diagnosed?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose it would make me feel better. A couple of years ago, I was friendly with this girl. I told her everything. All about my high school-home instruction experience, being ill, and so on. Anyway, she asked me what I was suffering from if I was so sick. I told her it was undiagnosable at that point, and told her about the hundreds of doctors I'd seen, the different tests and treatments I had tried. She asked me if I was suffering from Munchausen's Syndrome. Have you heard of it?  I wasn't sure what that was, so I simply told her I didn't think so and looked it up when I got home. Do you know what that is? It is some disease that you pretend to have in order to get attention from being sick. I was so hurt and so angry at the same time! What kind of an idiot would choose this lifestyle? How insensitive can a person be? And the thing is, right now even if that is what I'm suffering from, I'd be thrilled.  At least I would have a diagnosis, a prognosis, and a treatment plan. Now I have nothing!", "input": "", "output": "You're talking about something that we call Factitious Disorder.  It's a conscious effort to deceive doctors so that they can assume the sick role.  But it's done on purpose.  From what I can tell, Cassie, you're a very smart young woman.  Are you pretending to be sick?"}, {"instruction": "No! Not at all! I want to be normal so badly. What I would give to be average. I don't want this attention! I want a regular life!", "input": "", "output": "That's what I thought, Cassie.  I have no doubt that you are generally suffering and that you aren't pretending to be sick to gain attention.  Have you heard back from Dr. Halsey yet?"}, {"instruction": "I spoke with his office this morning. I have an appointment with him tomorrow afternoon. I'm feeling a bit ambivalent about the whole thing. Each time I go through the process of seeing a new doctor, there's this great hope that an answer or a clue will be uncovered. I just don't want my hopes to be dashed yet again.", "input": "", "output": "There is nothing wrong with cautious optimism. I believe that Dr. Halsey is a very responsible and thorough doctor.  He'll do his best to help you."}, {"instruction": "I suppose.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me, how was the rest of your weekend? Did you see Brian?"}, {"instruction": "The weekend was truly yucky, to say the least. Feeling this way and not being able to shake it is the pits. I did see Brian. He came over with a pizza on Sunday. Actually, he called Sunday morning and did his usual invite himself over to dinner thing. I was in such pain that I had no tolerance or patience to deal with his crap. So I told him that he obviously just didn't have a clue as to what I'm about and to fuck off. Then I hung up on him. I think he was slammed by my reaction. I never did anything like that before, so he knew he was in the doghouse in a big way. He tried calling back, but I was screening my calls. He must have thought at first it was a joke because he was giggling saying, \"C'mon! You can't be serious, Cassie.\" The next thing I know, he is at my door with a dozen red roses, a video, and a pizza. I was flabbergasted! The guy actually bought a clue! Go figure. We didn't watch the video, I wasn't up for it, but the pizza was good.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have a good talk with him?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I wasn't thinking all that great, and half of what I say goes into one ear and out the other anyway. I was ready to call it quits. Sometimes, I don't think he's worth all the trouble. I don't have enough energy to get my things done, why add frustration and aggravation to that?", "input": "", "output": "But how do you feel about Brian? When we first talked, you said you thought you loved him. Do you still feel the same way?"}, {"instruction": "I do care very much for Brian, and I'm sure I always will. I think I may be in love with him. I don't know for sure. Right now, I just don't want anything too complicated or emotionally draining. Is that wrong of me not to want to make any commitment to him?", "input": "", "output": "As long as you are honest with him, no. That is simply what you feel right now. It does not require a good or a bad label."}, {"instruction": "I know. I wouldn't want to hurt him or anything. I just have this huge thing hanging over my life right now. Plus I had this really weird dream the other night. I was walking through a long hallway, and there were two doors. One door was slightly ajar, so I peeked in. Brian was sitting at a desk taking notes off a blackboard. The room was empty, but spit-balls kept flying toward the front of the room and handwriting magically appeared on the blackboard. I backed off and bumped into a door behind me. This door was locked. I crouched down and tried to look through this peephole. Then I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was this man who took me in his arms and kissed me passionately. It was so intense! All I could recall when I woke up were his eyes, these smoldering blue-gray eyes. It just got me to thinking, what if Brian isn't the right man for me?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I think it's more important that you're happy with the way he treats you and the way you feel with him."}, {"instruction": "Well, I think this weekend gave him some food for thought. That I need and want him to respect me as well as treat me properly.", "input": "", "output": "Very good. That is certainly a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, our time is up for today, Cassie. I do want you to let me know how everything goes with Dr. Halsey. Let's schedule a meeting for the same time next week.  That's Tuesday, September 10th at 1 pm.  If anything new happens, and you need to talk, please call me, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Doctor. Thank you. Have a good week.", "input": "", "output": "You too, Cassie. Bye."}, {"instruction": "Hi Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good day Cassie. How are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "Gosh, I don't know. There is so much swirling around in my head.\nI saw Dr. Halsey again. Did he speak to you?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Why don't you tell me what happened?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know where to start. Let's see...he went over some of\nthe medical reports and his findings. A lot of that medical technical mumbo-jumbo\nthat doctors are so fond of using, half of which I just drone out after\ntime. Then he told me he had a diagnosis. I was so shocked and surprised!\nI mean, I have only seen him a few times. I have spent so many years seeing\nso many doctors, it seemed hard to believe that he could find an answer\nso easily and quickly. Anyway, I didn't know if I should cry or be happy\nor scream. After all these years to finally have a diagnosis--a name to\nput to all this stuff my body goes through! Of course, it's a relief. But\nI was almost scared to hear what he was going to say. As he probably told\nyou, I have something called \"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\" He promised\nme he would get some literature on it so I can learn more. He suggested\nI find a support group as well, so I can talk to other people who are going\nthrough the same thing. It's all so weird and overwhelming.", "input": "", "output": "How much of the diagnosis do you understand? How do you think\nit will affect your life now that you have a diagnosis?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know. There was way too much to absorb all in one\nsitting. Now that I have this, I want to know what I can do to fix it, to\nbe better. I don't know what it means in terms of planning out my life goals.\nI don't even know if it is contagious. Or how I got this in the first place.\nI'd rather just know how to get rid of it. It seems I have more unanswered\nquestions than when I started.", "input": "", "output": "I think the idea of finding a support group is excellent. From\nwhat I understand, Dr. Halsey is doing some research into disease. I am\nsure you will get some of those questions answered quite soon."}, {"instruction": "I am so grateful that for all of his support, knowledge, and\npatience. I am confused about the name of this illness, though. Chronic\nFatigue. Does that mean I just need more sleep? I know there are days when\nI feel like I can sleep forever, but it doesn't seem to get rid of my symptoms.\nActually, I wouldn't even say fatigue is my chief complaint. Sure, it's\nannoying, and I am always so tired and wiped out. But there is so much more.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Cassie, all three of us are new to this and will learn\nmore as we go along. From what I understand, the fatigue is only one component\nof the illness. You also have some immune problems. Did he discuss this\nwith you at all?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, a little. But quite honestly, I don't recall very much.\nShell shock, I guess. He said something about my white blood cell count\nbeing irregular. Is this related to AIDS? Isn't that the problem in AIDS\npatients?", "input": "", "output": "In advanced forms of the disease, AIDS patients do have very\nlow white blood cell counts. The virus slowly kills them off. I do not know\nif the mechanism works the same in CFS."}, {"instruction": "CFS? Is that an abbreviation for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?", "input": "", "output": "That's correct."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Well, how will this affect\nmy work? I got a letter from Ms. Bows the other day. I guess the office\nhas noticed my absences. Now there is a letter in my file. I can't believe\nit! I do so much around there. I try so hard to do well at work, and now\nI have this haunting me. What if I need to take more time off from work\nin the future? I can't tell you how many times I have covered for people.\nJeez! I wonder which rat squealed on me. I don't think Ms. Bows has that\nmuch of a problem with my work. When she does, she usually is up front about\nit. She will say something right then and there. Oh my! That reminds me.\nDid you hear she was in the hospital? I couldn't believe it! In the maternity\nward, no less. Wow. I stopped by the hospital to visit her and bring her\nsome flowers. She has always been kind to me, and I know what it is like\nto be ill. I couldn't get in to see her, but they said she had been admitted\ninto the maternity ward. That is pretty cool. But she sure wasn't showing\nor anything. I can't imagine why she's there, but I just hope everything\nis okay with her pregnancy if she's pregnant. I wonder if she will take\nleave and for how long. I'm sorry Doctor. I am rambling and jumping all\nover the place with my thoughts, aren't I?", "input": "", "output": "That is quite all right. Let's backtrack a bit. Have you had\nthe opportunity to discuss the personnel letter with any of your supervisors?"}, {"instruction": "No. Do you think I need to tell them about this CFS business?\nCome to think of it, I don't know how to tell anyone about it. What do I\nsay?! \"Hi, how are you doing? Things are pretty much the same. Oh,\nby the way, I have this disease called Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and the\ndoctors don't know much about it...?\"", "input": "", "output": "I am sure we can work out some way to make revealing the news\neasy on you. Have you discussed your diagnosis with anyone yet?"}, {"instruction": "No. I almost called Michelle, but she is due to visit during\nthe last weekend in September. I would rather discuss it with her in person\nthan over the phone. I don't know what to tell Brian. And my parents have\nbeen out of town this past week.", "input": "", "output": "I would suggest you get an information packet on CFS from Dr.\nHalsey, or the Centers for Disease Control. That is the agency that Dr.\nHalsey contacted to get information on CFS. They monitor studies, research,\ntrack illnesses, etc. The more information you have, the easier it will\nbe to discuss."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I guess I need to learn more. I'm almost afraid of what\nI might find out.", "input": "", "output": "What is it that you fear learning?"}, {"instruction": "That there is no hope. That I am going to linger like this forever.\nWeird, but I don't fear dying. Maybe because it seems so simple in comparison\nto the suffering. Not that I am considering suicide, Doctor. I want you\nto know that.", "input": "", "output": "That's good to hear. Did Dr. Halsey explain to you this is a\nphysiological problem and not a psychiatric illness?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. It's nice to know that this is not \"all in my head.\"\nI can't believe it. I'd love to take him around to every idiot who claimed\nI was making all this up!", "input": "", "output": "Your knowing is the most important thing. We can worry about\nothers later. Nonetheless, it is not uncommon for a patient with a chronic\nand disabling illness to suffer from some depression. It doesn't mean that\nit is a causative problem. It is quite natural--a normal response to an\noverwhelming situation."}, {"instruction": "I guess that is one thing that is normal about me! I have been\ndoing a lot of crying lately. I can't help but feel a sense of helplessness\nwhen I think about my life. Do you remember that woman who used the assisted\nsuicide doctor not too long ago? The one who I spoke to you about and had\nsimilar symptoms? She had this thing--this CFS. God, that is so scary! What\nkind of message does it say about this disease, my future, what I have to\nlook forward to? What is to become of me?", "input": "", "output": "I think she had some other problems on her plate. Besides, suicide\nis not a solution to your problem. Life will be difficult and challenging\nfor you, Cassie. I won't kid you nor lie to you. Things may get worse, get\nbetter, or never change. It is a hard reality to face. But I can teach you\nmany different coping mechanisms, and both Dr. Halsey and myself will do\nwhatever we can to give you relief and support."}, {"instruction": "Can I have a moment... I think I am going to start crying again.", "input": "", "output": "Of course. I don't know if Dr. Halsey spoke to you about anti-depressants,\nbut I would like to try you on one. It should help you cope better."}, {"instruction": "Does it have any side effects?", "input": "", "output": "Any drug or chemical you put in your body has the potential for\ncausing problems. The package insert should describe the possible reactions\nand side effects. Look it over before you take it, and if you have any questions,\nyou can always call me. I will start you on a very small dose and we'll\nsee how you do."}, {"instruction": "Okay. That seems reasonable. Will it also help this nagging fear\nand impending doom I have?", "input": "", "output": "It should enhance your mood, make you feel more upbeat."}, {"instruction": "Oh good. As much as I hate taking pills, I hate feeling this\nway even more. I'm sorry I have been such a pain in the butt.", "input": "", "output": "You are just trying to come to terms with everything. That is\nnot being a pain in the butt. Give yourself a break; cut yourself some slack,\nCassie. This is a tough thing to deal with, especially at the beginning\nof your life as a woman."}, {"instruction": "I guess that is one of those \"easier said than done\"\nbits of advice, huh Doc? I can't wait until the weekend. I need a break\nfrom everything. I wish I could just run away and escape! Leave all my problems\nbehind. I guess I'll get my chance when Michelle is in town. Meantime, I\nam going to soak myself in a nice long Epsom salt bath. Dr. Halsey said\nthe Epsom salt helps to soothe aching muscles and joints. And I think I\nwill play some cool music in the bathroom. A real \"Calgon take me away\"\nkind of night!", "input": "", "output": "Sounds refreshing and relaxing. I hope it helps. You will have\nto let me know. Here is that prescription that we talked about. We'll see\nhow you are doing next week, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Is there some way we can talk without me having to come in every\nweek? I think talking things out with you is really helpful, but now that\nI have to be more careful about work...", "input": "", "output": "Tell you what. Why don't we make next week a telephone consultation\nat this same time. That should free up some time for you. How does that\nsound?"}, {"instruction": "Very agreeable. But can we make it later on in the evening? That\nway I don't have to call from work.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine. I usually work pretty late. How about 5:30 on Tuesday?"}, {"instruction": "That's perfect. Thanks Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You are welcome. And since you're starting on a new drug, I want\nyou to be especially aware of any changes in your physical symptoms, either\ngood or bad. Always feel free to give me a call and talk about them, okay?\nEven if it's late at night or something."}, {"instruction": "I understand. I'll give you a call if I notice anything strange.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Take care Cassie. We'll talk next week. Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hey Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good day Cassie. How are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "Oh I guess I am hanging in. Another day, another day.", "input": "", "output": "Have the side effects subsided?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. Sometimes it is hard to tell because of the symptoms I normally have. I mean, it can be difficult to differentiate between my normal sickness and the reactions to the drug.", "input": "", "output": "I think at this point it would safe to assume that the Prozac is out of your system. How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "It was quite busy, actually. I went to the performance of Winging It. That was fun, though quite exhausting. Within minutes of being in the theater, my adrenaline began to rush through my body. It was like something in me was screaming, \"I am alive! I am alive!\" I did get up for one quick performance which was totally cool. The scene was a couple in a theme restaurant, and we just goofed around. Definitely fun! Afterwards there was a party. Although I was really bushed by this point, I was having such fun that I didn't want the night to end. So I joined the crowd. Anyway, this pissy girl comes up to me and asks me where I have been, and who do I think I am just waltzing back and onto the stage whenever I want. This guy, Michael, explained to her that I had an illness. When I originally told him I wasn't sure what was wrong with me. I decided this would be a good opportunity to \"come out of the closet.\" So I said, \"I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\" She laughed and in a very snide voice said, \"Honey, everyone gets a little tired from time to time. What are you a princess?!\" Needless to say, I was very upset! I tried in vain to explain to her, as well as the rest of the group, all the symptoms associated with this damned disease. I finally gave up and just pretended that it didn't bother me. When they laughed about it, I just smiled. To make things worse, it became a running joke. \"Can you grab me a beer\" \"Nope, I have 'too tired and lazy' syndrome!\" I was appalled.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I eventually excused myself, slipped out, and went home. And then I cried myself to sleep. I couldn't believe how wonderful the evening began and how awful it ended! People can be so ignorant and closed-minded! And cruel! I just don't get it. Plus, tell me this Doctor, who was the schmuck that named this disease? If it isn't all fatigue related, why did they chose that name?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I think originally, fatigue was the most common defining symptom of the patients suffering from this disorder.  So the consensus originally was to name it around that symptom--something that would differentiate it from other similar disorders, like Epstein Barr.  This was in the U.S. anyway.  In other countries I think they have different names for this disorder."}, {"instruction": "Really? Huh. I guess I should sit down and read all the CDC information that Dr. Halsey sent me. Everytime I sit down to read it, I get upset and depressed. I don't want this thing anymore. I suppose I was thinking once I knew what was wrong with me, I would feel better about things and could move on. But it seems as though the battle is just beginning.", "input": "", "output": "That's true Cassie. But don't lose hope.  There are many reported cases of remissions, so you may beat this thing yet. It always helps to have a positive attitude if possible and we can work on that.  Have you told anyone else about your diagnosis?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I told my parents. They were puzzled and still don't know what to expect. They kept asking if I will need surgery or chemotherapy or something radical. I tried to explain more to them, but I think it was too overwhelming for them. And me. But they are generally supportive, which is great in my book.", "input": "", "output": "Of course, I think their support is important. Have you told Brian?"}, {"instruction": "Him? No siree! He came by on Sunday and made me breakfast. It seems the worse I treat him, the better he treats me. Weird. I almost got violent with him too. Not that I am a violent person.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I was very tired--feeling awful and achy all over. He wanted to come over for breakfast and I said I wasn't able to prepare anything. He said he'd do all the work. He came over and proceeded to make a huge mess in the kitchen while making a total racket! My head was throbbing and my bones felt like they were going to explode! He walks over to where I was lying down and asked me something. Actually more like demanding immediate attention. I don't even know what he said, but I was annoyed. I just wanted to be left alone so I could get some relief. He wouldn't let me be. I grabbed a vase and went to bash it over his head. Halfway through my swing, I stopped and just screamed at the top of my lungs! Do you know what he says? \"Is something wrong, honey?\" Argh! Is something wrong?!", "input": "", "output": "I am glad you were able to control your violent impulse. Have you felt this way before?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes when the pain gets so bad, I just want to scream and break everything in sight. You know, be like Godzilla and stamp out the pain. Other times, the pain is so bad all I want to do is curl into a ball and cry. My tolerance and frustration level just drops immensely after long periods of feeling really ill.", "input": "", "output": "I will talk to Dr. Halsey about getting you on a pain killer. I think that may allieve some of your discomfort."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I am sure it will. When I take over-the-counter medication, it helps a little. I've also been drinking some herbal teas recently. I signed up for a newsletter for CFS patients and it recommends all these alternative healing techniques. The tea tastes great but I don't think it does anything. It's soothing, but anything warm to drink usually is. At least for me.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm glad that you are reaching out to a community of people suffering through similar problems and building up a support structure. And almost anything that helps is worth trying. How is work going?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. It is difficult for me to hang in and pay attention all day long. I almost feel as if I have this camaraderie with Ms. Bows. You see, she's pregnant but I think I am the only one at work who knows. I'm sure there's more than meets the eye there but I totally respect her need for privacy. I almost want to tell her about the CFS thing. It would be great if we could confide in one another. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "That is something for you to decide. Perhaps you can suggest spending some time with her away from the office."}, {"instruction": "That's a good idea; keep socializing out of the office. I think it might be helpful if my supervisor knew what I was going through. I don't know. I'll play it by ear.", "input": "", "output": "Have you had any more problems at work?"}, {"instruction": "Well, there is one guy who constantly mutters things under his breath. I think he's the jerk who caused that letter in my personnel file. Anyway, he said something while I was getting some coffee, but I just ignored him. If he has something up his butt, that's his problem. I am not in the mood for a big confrontational scene.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. However, it might be wise to address this issue before it gets out of hand. You may want to politely ask him if there is anything he would like to discuss with you."}, {"instruction": "Thanks for the suggestion, but I really don't want to deal with him right now. He has a major attitude to begin with--he's a \"in your face\" kind of guy.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Now that we have essentially played the \"good news/bad news\" game, ready for more good news?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "I had the dream again--several times this week. This guy is totally amazing. I wish I could remember more of his face. I have been trying to sketch him when I wake up, but I can't recall anything concrete. I do have the doodles I made when I was working on it last. Would you like to see them?", "input": "", "output": "Of course, thank you. Tell me more about the man in your dreams."}, {"instruction": "Or of my dreams? Same difference. Well, in one dream we sat on a grassy hill sipping champagne. The stars were out and the night sky was truly majestic. It was one of those skies that look too beautiful to be real. We were discussing literature. And philosophy. And science. And entertainment. And everything. It was so delightful. Quiet and romantic. Every once in awhile he would grab my hand, look into my face with these incredibly smoldering eyes, and smile... I have the chills just thinking about it. I know this is pretty stupid thing to ask, but...", "input": "", "output": "Please continue."}, {"instruction": "Well, do you think it is possible that there is really someone out there like this? I mean he seems too real to be just a dream.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it is possible. But this is a fantasy, Cassie. Perhaps you are compensating for Brian in your dreams with this mystery man. I would like you to try something. Write down all the qualities in the dream man that you like. On a separate piece of paper, write down all the qualities you like in Brian. Compare and see what you find, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Well our time is up for today. Will you be able to come in again next week?"}, {"instruction": "I would like to but I never know when I am going to crash.", "input": "", "output": "Let's schedule an appointment next Thursday at 5:30 pm and if something comes up, we can make it a phone consultation. How does that sound?"}, {"instruction": "That sounds fair enough.", "input": "", "output": "Fine. Okay, that's Thursday, October 3rd.  Goodbye Cassie."}, {"instruction": "I almost didn't. But I really needed to talk. I had to take a cab over because I am not feeling all that well today. In fact, I missed work. I left a message in the office and a separate one for Ms. Bows. I really want to explain to her that I am not just loafing off. I mean, if I lose my job, I lose my job. I am not quite on a lucky streak right now. And I have other things on my mind. But I respect her as well as admire her and I don't want to disappoint her.", "input": "", "output": "That is admirable of you. I am sure she will appreciate it. You mentioned in one of your sessions that you are a conscientious worker. I am sure missing a few days won't destroy your career at SII."}, {"instruction": "Yes I suppose. I don't know. Doctor, if I lose my job will you still be able to see me? As a therapist, I mean. I know I am in an HMO, and that you have a special relationship with the company.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I have an arrangement with the insurance company which provides health care to your company under an HMO. However I still have private patients and would be happy to continue seeing you. But I think we are getting ahead of ourselves. Tell me how your week was."}, {"instruction": "Jeez. It was quite crazy. Michelle called because she is coming in this weekend. She had all these massive plans for us and wanted to share them with me. She called on a very bad day for me. I couldn't think straight. It was horrible. She asked me if everything was okay. So I started to cry. I feel like such a failure.", "input": "", "output": "Then what happened."}, {"instruction": "Well she asked me what was wrong, so I told her I wasn't feeling too well. She then said that she hoped I would be feeling better for her visit since she had all these exciting things planned. What could I tell her? I don't know if I am going to get any better. I don't know if I am going to get worse. Heck, I don't think the doctors know a damned thing more than I do at this point! I couldn't stop crying. I finally asked her if I could call her back. She was hesitant to let go. But she did and after a few minutes I was able to compose myself and return the call. I explained to her that I had finally been given a diagnosis. She replied, \"Yea for you!\" She knew how frustrating it was for me to be ill and not know what was wrong with me. Then I started to explain what it all meant. She always believed that when I had a diagnosis, a cure or treatment would shortly follow. She was so bummed for me. It was nice to share the news with someone who really cares. Someone who is truly supportive and wants to hear the whole story. She is even going to call the CDC and try to get some more information.", "input": "", "output": "So she was receptive and supportive?"}, {"instruction": "Yes and I am quite relieved. That pissy girl's reaction still haunts me. If a friend acted like she did...I think I would hide in a hole forever.", "input": "", "output": "I think you will find more supportive people as well. Have you said anything to Brian?"}, {"instruction": "Yes I did.", "input": "", "output": "What was his response?"}, {"instruction": "He asked what it all meant. Then he asked me if that is why I won't sleep with him. I was rather shocked. I mean he was so forthright about it all. He then began asking if this thing is contagious. He totally freaked and asked how I could put him in jeopardy if I knew something was wrong. I started to cry and then he got apologetic. That's when I hung up the phone.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He called back and left a message on my machine. There was no way I was going to talk to him. Every day he leaves another message. \"Hi, it's me, Brian. I think we need to talk. I'm sorry about everything. Please call me.\" I have yet to call him. I need some space--some time to figure everything out.", "input": "", "output": "And what have you figured out thus far?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure. On the one hand I don't know if I love Brian. Or even if I could love him. Which means I should just end things already. But right now he is willing to have me and I am not sure I will get to be so lucky again.", "input": "", "output": "Lucky? What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, considering I have this illness--Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Did you know that isn't even the real name? It is called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome. In Japan, they call it Killer Cell Syndrome, because it destroys the immune system. In Canada and the United Kingdom, it's called myalgic encephalomyelitis. Actually, I am not sure if I have that name exactly right--it is quite the mouthful!", "input": "", "output": "Actually that sounds like a better name than chronic fatigue syndrome.  Let's see--myalgic means muscular pain and encephalomyelitis is a viral infection of the central nervous system, which seems to capture it fairly well."}, {"instruction": "I've never liked the name chronic fatigue syndrome, it makes it sound like you're just sleepy or something.  Did you know Florence Nightingale was rumored to have this illness in her later years?", "input": "", "output": "No I didn't know that. I guess it shows you that you can still be a pretty amazing person even with this illness."}, {"instruction": "I guess so. I didn't think about it that way.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe you can find a book about her and learn more about her life. See her as a role model."}, {"instruction": "That's a pretty good idea. I wonder what it must have been like for her. I met this woman through a support group network. She has had CFIDS for five years or so.", "input": "", "output": "CFIDS?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, that's what they call it--Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome.  CFIDS.  Anyway, with the diagnosis procedure so crazy, she isn't quite certain about the onset. Anyway, she has two young girls and a husband. She is totally bedridden at this point. She had been working part time and taking care of the house. She just got sicker and sicker and then one day couldn't get out of bed. Her children leave some food and an icebox by her bed before they leave for school. Her husband calls around lunch time to check on her. Then when the girls come home they begin preparing dinner. She has to schedule her bathroom visits around who is going to be in the house with her. It is so sad.", "input": "", "output": "It is, but she seems to have found a way to manage. As you will. And you are much better than she is"}, {"instruction": "Thank God for that! To tell you the truth, I've been thinking about finding a roommate. Someone who would be able to help me out with things. In return, I will give the person a great deal. My apartment is very lovely and spacious.", "input": "", "output": "That is productive thinking."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. What can I say, sometimes the noggin actually works! I wish Michelle lived out here--that would be perfect. Oh well. Doctor, do you have anything to drink here? I am getting a little light headed and a sip of something would do me a world of good.", "input": "", "output": "Sure. I have a dispenser in the other room. You rest. I will go get it for you."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "There you go."}, {"instruction": "Thanks again. Ah...much better. It's like I can feel the fluids drain right out of my body and my temperature skyrocket. Very weird.", "input": "", "output": "Have you seen Dr. Halsey again?"}, {"instruction": "No, not yet. We have been playing phone tag mostly. I turn the ringer off on my phone when I feel like crap, so I missed a couple of his calls. I heard he is going to try to attend a conference on CFIDS so he can better treat me. At first he wanted to refer me to this big wig specialist. The guy has been doing research for many years and has published a lot in the scholarly journals. But he doesn't accept any insurance and expects cash up front. To top that off, he charges $800 and up for a round of blood tests and a $375 consultation fee for the first 30 minutes. That is a lot of money, you know? Just to get a diagnosis from him. He doesn't accept patients unless he has personally diagnosed them. Then he charges $300 for a follow-up visit where he explains what his findings are. After that, visits are $275 for a fifteen minute visit or phone consultation. The nerve! Here he is dealing with a group of desperate patients, many whom cannot work and have already spent life savings on doctors and tests and phony cures, and he is ready to bleed them dry! Ugh. I can not respect that. If he had the cure then maybe. But just to be monitored, I don't think so.", "input": "", "output": "I had no idea. That's a shame. I am glad that Dr. Halsey is willing to go to those extra steps for you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he's a nice guy. I get so nervous around most doctors--I don't trust them more than I could throw them. But you and he are actually human. I am very glad that I found you both to help me deal with my lot in life.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Well let's leave it on that upbeat note, at least for me. Our time is up for today. Shall we schedule an appointment for next week, same time?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. That would be great. Can I borrow the phone to call a cab to take me back home?", "input": "", "output": "Sure. You can use the one in the other room. And feel free to wait there until the cab arrives."}, {"instruction": "Thanks Doctor. Have a good week.", "input": "", "output": "You too Cassie. Bye."}, {"instruction": "Okay, it has been a long time. Well, actually, I'm miserable.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that.  What's going on?"}, {"instruction": "David thought it would be good to get out last night, so we went to a book shop nearby. At first, it was quite nice. We were sitting together quietly. We both love to people watch. I decided to see if there were any new books on the treatment of CFIDS. There was a wacky diet-regimen publication. I mean, none of it made any sense whatsoever--drink a mixture of carrot and banana juices, with a tablespoon of linseed oil. The author's theory was that carrots provide beta carotene which replaces vitamins \"sucked-out\" by the viruses. Bananas help regulate bowel movements--the elimination of wastes and garbage from the body makes you healthier. And linseed oil...well, the author didn't seem to have a real good reason for using it. You're supposed to stick the concoction in the blender and serve with parsley sprigs. Yuck!  At what point do you decide the possible treatment isn't worth all the suffering if there are no guarantees of recovery? How many weird things do I need to try? Oh, the book said not to expect results for six months. Hello?! I don't think so!", "input": "", "output": "You're right.  It doesn't sound promising."}, {"instruction": "Meantime, David wants me to proofread all of his writing. I don't mind helping when I can--I'm more than happy to do so.  But sometimes, I just can't. Do you remember those weird dreams I was having when I used to come in?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. You still have them?"}, {"instruction": "I get these dreams every once in a while and I'm sure they're trying to tell  me something.  But I can't figure out what the heck it all means!", "input": "", "output": "I'd really rather talk about you and your present situation.  It's been an awfully long time since I saw you last."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But I feel these dreams are really important.  They might be a key to what's going on.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, why don't you tell me a little about your latest dream and perhaps we can find some insights together."}, {"instruction": "Let me think...well, last night I had an odd one. I dreamt that I was in a long white hall. I told David about the dream, and he thought it might have been a hospital of some sort. But it didn't have that feeling to me. In the dream, I turned into a doorway; it seemed to be where I was living. There was a man inside preparing a meal, and we greeted each other. Two rats appeared out of nowhere. One was white and the other was black. The man and I were trying to figure out which one was the evil rat. I picked up the black one and stared into its eyes. Next, I did the same with the white rat. The latter gave me the creeps, and I threw it against the wall with all my might. It was obviously injured, but not dead, and it appeared to be growing in size. So I ran over, threw an apron over the rat, and began stomping on it violently, and then stabbing it. The entire time the rat was mocking me. Any ideas as to what this means?", "input": "", "output": "What do you think it means?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure, really. I suppose the violence I was unleashing had to do with my frustrations. The thing that I can't figure out is the significance of  the black and white rats. They seemed to be so essential to the story line, something very important. But I don't know why. I mean, it wasn't even like they were in the dream that long.  But even while dreaming, I recall knowing that they were important somehow.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  How do you feel about rats in general?   What do they represent to you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, they're ugly, disease-infested creatures, and generally mean-natured, I think. Scavengers. Their noses twitch in the weirdest way, like they want to get into everything and...well, like nosey-bodies.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So you have an association between inquiring--prying and rat imagery."}, {"instruction": "That's right.  Like someone is invading my privacy.  Or maybe I'm still trying to come to terms with my illness.  Maybe I'm being forced to do more than I'm prepared to right now. What do you think, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "These all sound like interesting possibilities."}, {"instruction": "David, although he's a dear, is constantly asking me to try new things, explore all avenues. As far as coming to terms with the illness, I don't see it happening in the near future. Actually, that isn't true. There are days when I'm resolved to whatever God has given me--just make the best of it. Other days, it all feels useless. And then there is the whole Human Resources and Social Security Administration fiasco. I started applying to see if I could get some benefits if and when I can't work. The people there ask so many questions. I know it's their job and all, but it still feels awkward. Then, Elise in human resources wants me to get copies of all the insurance and doctors' reports on my case--\"Why can't you just work like everyone else?\" kind of thing. Aggravating!", "input": "", "output": "So you feel like you're being pestered by people around you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, they're all rats!", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  What about the color difference of the rats.  Do you have any negative or positive associations with these colors?  What does the color black represent to you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure I understand the question. I mean, the color black is in clothes, jewelry, furniture, wall coverings.  In what context do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "Let's try this.  Close your eyes. Picture the color black in any form. Concentrate. How does it make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Warm. Intrigued. It's mysterious, but not in a scary way. Knowledgeable. It feels safe and inviting, yet still filled with so many things and ideas.", "input": "", "output": "Interesting.  You seem to have very positive associations with this color.  Now picture white. How does that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Cold. Frightened. In pain. Like being in a hospital. Maybe that's it?", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps, let's explore some more. Close your eyes again. Now just talk to me."}, {"instruction": "This scares me. Like something is missing. I can almost hear a small child crying in the background, searching for hope and answers.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like a small child?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe.  Hmm...that does make sense, I suppose. I've been trying to live more of a \"normal\" life lately. Sometimes, I tend to ignore the fact that I'm ill. I don't want to be ill.", "input": "", "output": "Of course not.  I understand. And I'm sure it will always be a struggle for you. That's normal, considering your situation."}, {"instruction": "But the white rat.", "input": "", "output": "What about it?"}, {"instruction": "It was mocking me. Like it was better than I am. That makes me so angry. I'm not a very violent person, I don't think. But I just wanted to kill that thing--that rat.  I feel badly about it. I mean, it's a living being. Doesn't it have the right to pursue its own happiness? But if its happiness causes me distress, then how do I deal with it?", "input": "", "output": "You may associate people who question your illness with this white rat.  It's natural that you would feel angry at them for doubting your physical condition.  You might even feel jealous of them for being so healthy themselves--so healthy that they are incapable of understanding how you feel.  If you have this dream again, try following it through further. Keep some paper handy, and if something strikes you as important, jot it down. Whatever comes to you--a feeling, an answer. And then we can discuss it next time, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "How are you doing? Are you getting tired?"}, {"instruction": "Truthfully, I am kind of wiped out. I'd really just like to lie down, rest my mind some.", "input": "", "output": "I can see you're getting pale. Perhaps it would be better to stop here."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I think so.", "input": "", "output": "How are you getting home?"}, {"instruction": "David is coming by, but he probably won't be here for another ten or fifteen minutes or so.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Why don't you lie down and I'll dim the lights. You can rest until David arrives."}, {"instruction": "Oh, that would be a lifesaver. Thank you, Dr. Balis. You're a very sensitive and kind man.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Cassie."}, {"instruction": "No, no, I mean it.  You're just very empathetic. You know life is not easy and can be harder for some people than others. You know that we all need a little help from time to time.", "input": "", "output": "Now rest, Cassie.  Do you want to schedule our next session now or would you rather call me to set it up?"}, {"instruction": "I have to arrange my transportation.   Do you mind if I call once I have discussed it with David?  I can find out which days work for him and...", "input": "", "output": "No problem, Cassie.  Call me when you know when you can make."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Now try to get some rest, Cassie."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor. Long time no see.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Cassie.  It is nice to see you."}, {"instruction": "I suppose it would be more helpful if I come more regularly. It's just that it's so difficult to get out of bed and get myself going. And when I actually get dressed and ready to go out, I would much rather do something fun. No offense, of course.", "input": "", "output": "None taken. I understand. It would be more useful if we could make this a more regular part of your life, but I'm here when you need me."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "So, what brings you here today?"}, {"instruction": "I'm seeing a new doctor. I don't think I care for him very much--I'm not sure yet. He asked me why I was there, and I told him I have CFIDS. He said, \"That means you have Epstein Barr, right?\" I told him it was something different. And then we argued about that for a few minutes. He asked me how I got tested for CFIDS. I told him that they narrowed it down by eliminating everything else. But he persisted in his questioning.  Stuff like: \"How could I have a diagnosis if there isn't a specific blood test?\" Well, eventually he gave up. He's a chiropractor, by the way. I think he decided that since medicine was bullshit anyway, it didn't make much of a difference.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Why did you start seeing him for treatment?"}, {"instruction": "My bones have been aching, and my back goes out so frequently it's impossible to sleep or even lie down. So a friend recommended that I try a chiropractor.  This doctor is relatively close by. His adjustment--the back cracking--seems to help a little bit. I don't want to give up before I give him a real chance, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand. Do you have a medical doctor as well?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I'm in contact with Doctor Halsey. He's such a dear heart! I adore the man. He's still playing with different drugs and stuff. Still researching. In fact, he went to a conference a few weeks ago, but I don't think he learned anything new. When I mentioned it during our last visit, he didn't say much. And he knows how upset I get when there isn't any good news.", "input": "", "output": "Does he know about your chiropractor?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I don't think he's fond of chiropractors. But he supports anything that might help me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think it would help if the two of them discussed your case?"}, {"instruction": "Ha! The chiropractor, Doctor Newland, despises the medical profession and doesn't even believe in the germ theory! He said germs don't cause disease--the subluxations in the back cause people to get sick. So I doubt they would get very far. I suppose you could say they're members of a mutual admiration society--not! He he he he...", "input": "", "output": "I see. What else have you been up to?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Elise and I are playing phone tag--she's the woman from human resources. She's supposed to get all the documentation for the social security application. Anyway, I think she has sent in most of what they need, but there are a few loose ends. From what I've learned about the whole social security mess, I think they automatically deny everyone who applies and then give opportunities for a review. This could go on forever and a day. Quite honestly, I somehow doubt it will ever get anywhere.", "input": "", "output": "Does that bother you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes and no. I mean, I paid into the damned thing. Now I'm ill and deserve the benefits. I could certainly use them. But I hate admitting the defeat--that the CFIDS has won and I've given up hope for a normal life.", "input": "", "output": "Receiving Social Security doesn't mean giving up. It simply allows you the opportunity to regroup."}, {"instruction": "Well, whatever. I just doubt that it will be worth all the aggravation. You know, they sent me to three doctors already? The first one, a psychiatrist, was very nice and sympathetic. He explained the medical review to me and answered some questions. Then I saw a general practitioner/internist as well as a neurologist. They both were assholes--totally arrogant and clueless as to what CFIDS is and how it affects a people. How they ever got appointed to their positions, I will never understand. And when I returned home, all I could do was cry. It's like rubbing my nose into the fact that I can't work like a normal person, can't play like normal person, can't do anything like a normal person. Why don't they just tattoo the word \"loser\" on my head and get it over with?", "input": "", "output": "You and I both know you aren't a loser. You can't let them get to you. Remember, they might not be doing it well, but they're only doing their job."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I suppose. David always makes fun of them. He says they aren't real doctors and can't hold down a real practice. What does he call them? Let me think...medical piranhas. Isn't that a riot?", "input": "", "output": "That's pretty good. How are things between you and David these days?"}, {"instruction": "Pretty good. Actually, he's been quite considerate lately. I guess he picks up on my level of pain. I think I tend to get testy with him when I feel rotten. He calls me pissy-girl. Kind of funny, don't you think? I used to take offense, but I cooled off, became calm, and realized what he meant. I can get a little nasty and irritable when I'm feeling awful.", "input": "", "output": "I think everyone does, to a degree."}, {"instruction": "By the way, did you hear about Doctor Kevorkian? There was another assisted suicide. The woman was suffering from CFIDS. I have the release from the AP wire with me, actually. Let me read it to you: \"Kevorkian may have assisted suicide. Southfield, Michigan. (AP) Doctor Jack Kevorkian apparently struck again on the very day the Supreme Court ruled there is no fundamental right to assisted suicide. Hours after yesterday's ruling, a woman was found dead in a motel with a note to call Kevorkian's lawyer. Geoffrey Fieger said the 40-year-old woman suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome and from fibromyalgia, or muscle pain. He also announced that he is running for governor next year.\" What a piece of work--the guy's running for governor! Anyway, I got a copy faxed to me from a fellow PWC. The poor woman--the poor tortured soul. It's such a shame.", "input": "", "output": "A PWC?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm sorry. A Patient With CFIDS. The whole thing kind of reminds a person how awful this disease is. But I wouldn't go that far--suicide, I mean. There are times when all I can do is curl up into a ball, rock myself to sleep with tears streaming down my face, and beg God to put an end to my suffering. But there's more to life, isn't there? There are people who are worse off. But this type of thing brings awareness and the severity of the illness to the general public.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you don't have the urge to follow in this woman's footsteps."}, {"instruction": "Me too.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still having very intense dreams?"}, {"instruction": "Yes! Funny you should ask. Do you recall the one with the black and white rats? Well, I had it a few more times with slight variations. So David--being the wise ass that he is--bought me two ceramic figurines. I think they are supposed to be mice, but it's a joke between us. He really has helped me laugh at myself and lighten up. Anyway, shortly after putting them on the bedroom dresser, those black and white rat dreams stopped waking me. Go figure. The newest dream revolves around a mountain. I'm on a trip of some sort. Definitely leisure. Some friends and I are hiking on a trail and get to the base of a mountain. They begin to set their gear up, and I realize I've forgotten mine. As they begin the climb, I follow up just using the rope they dangled behind them. It gets colder and colder and then dark and cloudy. The ropes start to get slippery, and I begin to fall. First, I'm just slipping a bit. And then, I'm tumbling quickly down the mountainside. It didn't feel like I had climbed very high up, but the fall seems like an eternity. When I finally hit the ground with a hard thud, I realize I've lost my sight. I start to feel \"things\" pecking at me, stabbing and probing. Whatever they are get harder and harder, faster and faster, and more and more ferocious. I begin to scream with all my might, but no sounds emanate from my mouth. It's truly horrid! And I have trouble waking myself up.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds very unpleasant. What do you think it means?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I tried keeping up with the crowd, but I wasn't  prepared to do so, right? That's why I didn't have the appropriate gear. The falling probably has to do with my fear of getting worse and falling into despair. The loss of sight may have to do with my feelings of losing my way in life. And the probing may be the interference of medical professionals. You know how I feel about them. I'm not sure about the clouds and the cold.", "input": "", "output": "You've thought about this dream a lot."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I try to keep a journal by the bed. That way, I can jot down notes when I wake up and reflect upon them later. It's come in handy. And shortly after I crack the riddle of a dream, it goes away. Makes me feel like I'm helping myself a little.", "input": "", "output": "Dreams can provide great insight, and the journal is an excellent tool. I'm glad you're trying to find ways of helping yourself. Our time's just about up.  Do you need a few minutes by yourself before your ride arrives?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, please. I'm getting a little weary. Can you get me a glass of water, please? I would like to take some medication.", "input": "", "output": "Of course. And, Cassie, I know that it's difficult for you to come here, so please don't hesitate to call me when you need to talk.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Cassie."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor. Thank you for squeezing me into your schedule. I had such a bad night yesterday. I didn't know what to do, or where to go, or who to turn to. I spent most of the morning crying.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Cassie. Why don't you tell me what's bothering you?"}, {"instruction": "Gosh, I'm not sure I know where to start. Let's see, David came by yesterday like always. Everything seemed pretty much status quo--same shit, different day. He brought over take-out for dinner. We were going to watch a video and maybe play a game of cards or something. But he seemed quite fidgety and began to snap at me over the stupidest things. Why didn't I bring more than two napkins over to the table? Why do I always leave the window open a crack? Everything I did seemed to annoy him. Then we got into an argument over finances. He has been very gracious to me--lending me money if I need it for something, paying whenever we do anything together. I mentioned that I might take a friend out for lunch sometime this week. She just got a promotion, and I wanted to do something special for her. Not extravagant, mind you. It's not like I was going to take her to the Four Seasons for the weekend or anything like that. Just a quiet lunch somewhere--a little more upscale than a drive-thru. Well, he freaked! I have no business doing something like this--how am I going to get the money? Do I think he's made of money? Just totally unleashing on me. It was so odd, so unlike him. I was doing my best to hold back the tears. I didn't want him to see me cry, but I felt so humiliated! I wasn't going to ask him for the money to take her out, and she has treated me...and him many times!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Why do you think David overreacted like that?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure he feels the need to ensure that I'm well taken care of, especially the necessities. But he's not my father, and I never asked him for help. It's bad enough I'm in the position that I need it--that I can't help myself or pay for my fair share of things. But dominate! It makes me feel so worthless and insignificant. Since I stopped working, the only thing I can afford to give people is me--my time and so on. But I'm ill, and my time is not worth so much these days--it just doesn't go very far anymore. I know my friends must think they are nurses or babysitters of some sort when we go out together. They have to pay for me, pick me up, drive me wherever, take care of me when I'm not well. It sucks! And this one woman has been a doll since the first day I met her. I have some rainy day mad money. This is how I decided to use it. Why shouldn't I be able to make that decision without a consultation with David first? It makes me feel like I need to go behind his back when I want to spend money.", "input": "", "output": "Did you explain your feelings to him?"}, {"instruction": "I started to, but then I stopped.", "input": "", "output": "Why? Was he not listening?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he had an attitude for starters. Whatever I said wasn't going to be good enough to explain my actions. And I guess I was afraid.", "input": "", "output": "Afraid of what?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Did you think he was going to hurt you? Hit you?"}, {"instruction": "No! He'd never do that.", "input": "", "output": "Then what?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I was afraid of sounding stupid, of him getting even more upset with me, of feeling more pathetic.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, let's address each issue separately. Feeling stupid. Did you think David was going to think you were stupid?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe. He can twist my words around. And before I know it, I've agreed to one of his points and my whole argument has been deflated. That makes me feel stupid.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Next time, try not to make it an argument. Consider it an \"explanation\" session. Explain your feelings and allow him to describe how he feels. Don't allow interruptions. Allow each other to say your peace. And then, allow some quiet time to sort things out."}, {"instruction": "But I don't want him to think I'll give in. Or that I'm giving up simply because we're taking a time-out.", "input": "", "output": "Then tell David that. I think this approach might alleviate some of the pressure you feel in talking with David. Okay, as far as David getting more upset with you, can you explain what you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when we get into these conversations and they lead to arguments, I feel a chill in the air and the heat of words. It's like the blood pressure of the room begins to rise. Do you know what I mean? It makes me feel awful. Like I'm being punished or something. Or like I'm not a good person.", "input": "", "output": "When people argue, they get upset and feel bad. David's probably feeling much the same way you do.  And it even might be that David's not upset with you personally. He might be feeling frustrated with the issues at hand and his own inability to get them fixed. What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I never thought of it that way. I guess it just makes me feel like a little child getting into trouble again.", "input": "", "output": "But you haven't done anything wrong, Cassie. You aren't in trouble. Do you feel this way in all your confrontations?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't like them, if that's what you mean. I guess I get intimidated easily. It's like my opinions and beliefs have no value. I suppose this is a self-esteem issue I need to work on, huh?", "input": "", "output": "That would help. You know, Cassie, many patients with chronic illnesses have similar feelings. They feel a lack of self-worth. They believe themselves to be a burden on their families and friends. Their self-esteem has taken a battering. And arguments can cause additional stress. I think you need to talk about these concerns with David. Not during an argument, but during a nice quiet time. Remember not to place blame. Now, let's talk about why you feel pathetic. Tell me what you mean."}, {"instruction": "I think I may cry--I just feel so helpless, so pathetic. I can't do a damned thing without someone intervening on my behalf. I'm a prisoner of war, and the fight...the struggle is within my body. I have been invaded, and it has screwed up my life! One of the reasons I don't come here often is because I have to ask someone to take me and bring me home. People have to rearrange their schedules for me. I feel like a pest. Actually, I might as well be an animal. Someone's sick pet. Feed me, bathe me, take me to the doctor....And I just sit around, wondering when I get my life back. Wondering when I get a chance to be \"normal\". I just don't understand why this happened to me. How did I get this awful disease? I always tried to be a good person, to do the right thing...can I please have a tissue? I'm sorry for breaking down like this.", "input": "", "output": "Cassie, take a deep breath. You have nothing to apologize for. Things are difficult for you right now. I know you are frustrated and upset by it all. And..."}, {"instruction": "I think I know what you're going to say, Doctor--life has a weird way of working things out. Enjoy what you can and take the help you need. There are people who care very much about you. You are a special person, and you are worthy of assistance. That's about it, isn't it?  Yeah, I'm special all right.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  But wouldn't you help someone else out if they needed it?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I probably would.", "input": "", "output": "So why is it so difficult to accept someone else's help?"}, {"instruction": "It's a lot different to take help rather than give help.  You see?", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  It is difficult to take somebody's help.  Some patients find it almost painful to be someone else's debt.  Tell me, what's your average day like?"}, {"instruction": "Not very eventful, really. It depends on the day and how I'm feeling. I watch television, listen to music, thumb through brochures. I've been trying to keep track of the social security crap, gather information as needed. I try to straighten my room as it gets messy. Occasionally, I'll do a load of laundry. Nothing exciting, obviously.", "input": "", "output": "Then I'm going to give you some homework. I want you to get a hobby--find something meaningful, something that you derive pleasure doing. Then, as you feel up to it, work a little on it. Work on it even if it's just jotting down some notes or doing some drawings. Think about how you can accomplish some goals or reach a certain competency in your hobby field. Do you think you can do that?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose. But why?", "input": "", "output": "Unfortunately, there is very little information on the prognosis for CFIDS, so we don't know when you will have you old life back.  And the one thing I don't want you to do is sit around and wait for the moment when you'll get all better and will be able to do all the things that you were used to doing before this happened."}, {"instruction": "That does sound bad.", "input": "", "output": "I don't want you to spend your life waiting.  I want you to engage in life to whatever degree that you're capable of at the moment.  Taking on a new hobby will give you a chance to start fresh and new--to plan a life for yourself. That's what I want you to do--design and implement a new life. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "I'll give it a try.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "I'd like to bring David in for a session, if that's okay with you.", "input": "", "output": "Certainly.  I have no problem with that."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I hope to see you again soon. Goodbye, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Cassie."}]
