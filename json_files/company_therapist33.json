I won't bite."}, {"instruction": "I kind of figured that.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Why don't you sit down and we'll talk for awhile."}, {"instruction": "Fine. But there's nothing wrong with my life. It's just peachy.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? Then why are you here?"}, {"instruction": "My way overprotective mother sent me here. She thinks I have a drug problem.", "input": "", "output": "Does she have any reason to think that?"}, {"instruction": "My friend Angela was caught with cocaine in her room. My mom figured that since Angie and I are best friends that we must both do drugs. I mean, excuse me?", "input": "", "output": "Do you use drugs?"}, {"instruction": "I wouldn't call it \"using.\"", "input": "", "output": "What would you call it?"}, {"instruction": "Playing around.", "input": "", "output": "Could you please explain what you mean by \"playing around?\""}, {"instruction": "It means I do drugs every once in a while. Like at a party, for example. And sometimes when I'm down. And sometimes when I'm happy and all. But it isn't an all the time thing like it is with Angie. She does get excessive. But I'm supposed to talk about me not her, right?", "input": "", "output": "It's okay to talk about your friends. And it sounds like you're worried about her.  Have you ever considered telling Angie's parents about her drug problem?"}, {"instruction": "You know the saying, \"Friends don't let friends drive drunk?\"", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I believe that's true."}, {"instruction": "Well, the reason I don't tell her parents is because friends don't let friends get grounded either. Can you imagine what they'd do to her? Not to mention that they'd tell my parents, and then my parents would be convinced that I've been using drugs, too.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Do you think your friend is likely to get hurt if she continues to use drugs?"}, {"instruction": "Probably.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that telling her parents might even save her life?"}, {"instruction": "I guess that might be true.", "input": "", "output": "I think that getting grounded is a small price to pay for saving your friend's life, don't you?"}, {"instruction": "She's my best friend.", "input": "", "output": "Well then."}, {"instruction": "She has a child psychiatrist. I think her name is Doctor Francisco. Angie said she's great.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that your friend is getting help."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, me too.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about Angie's problem with drugs?"}, {"instruction": "I'm angry and sad, and I just feel icky!", "input": "", "output": "Icky?"}, {"instruction": "When I think of her problems, it makes my skin crawl. I think it could be me, or it could be worse. She could be driven to kill. She could kill herself. And what would I do without her? She is my best friend and the only person who understands the real me. What will I do if I lose her? She could die. Anyone who does drugs knows the facts. We know that we could die. We know drugs are toxic, and that keeps us from doing them, to some degree. But why can't we stay away altogether?", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel when you take drugs?"}, {"instruction": "I feel like I could fly into the clouds and never come down. I feel safe and happy. I feel like it never rains anymore. I feel wonderful. Maybe there is something in drugs that makes one feel happy and safe. Maybe they help me cope with my problems.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How do you feel when you don't take drugs?"}, {"instruction": "Depressed. I feel unloved. Nothing makes me feel satisfied without drugs. I feel like I'm a piece of garbage.", "input": "", "output": "What drugs have you tried?"}, {"instruction": "Marijuana, cocaine, heroin, LSD, and some other stuff. There's this one thing that makes me feel so high.", "input": "", "output": "What is it?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, but you mix it with alcohol and it makes you feel great.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have a dealer?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't know who gets them.

Mostly football players. Some are basketball players.", "input": "", "output": "The jocks?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. We call them preps.", "input": "", "output": "Preps? Why?"}, {"instruction": "It's the way they dress. They're the rich guys. You know the type: million dollar houses, hundred-thousand dollar cars, and outfits that cost more than an American-made mini van.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Are they really that rich?"}, {"instruction": "They are. I've been to their houses.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Well, Nicole, what about your family? What are they like?"}, {"instruction": "I'm on my second stepfather. He has a great personality. He really loves my mother. He loves my half-sister, Dianne. She's three and a half.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  How does he feel about you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if he loves me. He complains about the music I like. He despises Angie. He hated my ex-boyfriend, Jeff. He hates all the things that make me me. Does that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it makes sense to me. How do you feel about him? Do you like him?"}, {"instruction": "Tom is great. He treats me well. He doesn't beat me or my mom.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What about your mother?"}, {"instruction": "Mom? She's a wonderful woman. She is so great. Normally, she believes me about things, although lately she's turned into Tom. She's always loved Angie, and she knows Angie's problems. She knows that Angie's mom died in a car accident five years ago. But none of it matters now; now, she just wants to please Tom.", "input": "", "output": "Nicole, you said you liked Tom."}, {"instruction": "I used to. Now, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Earlier, you said that he doesn't beat you. Have you been beaten by your father or stepfather in the past?"}, {"instruction": "My first stepfather beat me every night. He hated me. He thought that I was the biggest piece of trash to set foot on the Earth.", "input": "", "output": "He beat you and told you that you were worthless?"}, {"instruction": "It made me feel awful. I thought he was supposed to love me. But he just beat me. He didn't care. He was a lot nicer before he married mom.", "input": "", "output": "Do you need a tissue?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "I know it was your mother's idea for you to come to see me. But I believe that if we spend some time talking together about your problems and how you feel about the world and those closest to you, it might really help you.  What do you think, Nicole?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. Can you help Angie, too?", "input": "", "output": "If she'll agree to come, I will help her. Otherwise, I can't."}, {"instruction": "Why not?", "input": "", "output": "I can't make decisions for Angie."}, {"instruction": "Her grandmother can.", "input": "", "output": "Is her grandmother her guardian?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Well then, Angie's grandmother has the right to make certain decisions."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Nicole?"}, {"instruction": "I'm afraid Angie's going to overdose.

They don't understand me like Angie does.", "input": "", "output": "Have you thought about a peer group?"}, {"instruction": "A what?", "input": "", "output": "It's a group that most schools run. It's a place where students can talk about their problems. You might find a new friend there. Try talking to your counselor about it."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Maybe I can talk Angie into coming, too.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good idea. I also think that telling Angie's grandmother about Angie's drug problem would be very valuable."}, {"instruction": "Do you think Angie will forgive me?", "input": "", "output": "She is your friend, and you would be trying to help her. Why don't you try talking to Angie first? Maybe you can get her to ask for help on her own."}, {"instruction": "That's a great idea! I wish I had your brain. Thank you, Doctor. And, please, call me Nikki.", "input": "", "output": "Nikki?"}, {"instruction": "All my friends call me that.

I've seen all of his movies.", "input": "", "output": "Good. What about this guy you've met?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. He's this great guy named Shawn.

But now it can be cool.", "input": "", "output": "Where did you meet him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I was eating lunch in the cafeteria, and he came over and sat by me. We started talking and found out that we both liked the same movies, and the same music, and the same writers. Then he asked me out on a date. We went to the movies.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds nice."}, {"instruction": "I think I'm in love.", "input": "", "output": "In love?"}, {"instruction": "I know I seem too young to be in love, but I honestly think I'm in love. He's perfect for me.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm glad you've found..."}, {"instruction": "I know. I'm so happy.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "I guess you want to know about Angie.", "input": "", "output": "How is she?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she's okay, I guess. Her grandmother said that I can't see her again until I get my act together.

But apparently Angie's grandmother thinks I hand Angie some drugs and say: \"Look what I've got.\" She knows that I've quit because my mom talked to her.", "input": "", "output": "Does your mother think that you still do drugs?"}, {"instruction": "No. My mom knows better. Tom, on the other hand...", "input": "", "output": "Your stepfather?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Apparently he thinks that I don't really want to date a great guy like Shawn.", "input": "", "output": "Have you told Tom how you feel about Shawn?"}, {"instruction": "I've tried, but he said that since I did drugs once, I'll do them again.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How are the two related? What do your feelings for Shawn have to do with taking drugs?"}, {"instruction": "Tom knows that I will never do drugs again. I've promised him and my mother several million times that I will not do them again. How many times can a person beg for someone to believe them and not look like a fool?", "input": "", "output": "Maybe you should try talking to your parents one on one."}, {"instruction": "Can't you talk to them for me?", "input": "", "output": "No. You have to settle this issue on your own. I can help you develop a strategy for talking to your parents, but the actual talking you'll have to do yourself."}, {"instruction": "Why? You would do so much better than me.", "input": "", "output": "Getting your parents to trust you is something you have to do--no one else can talk them into trusting you."}, {"instruction": "What can I do to make them trust me?", "input": "", "output": "Trust is something you earn.  You show people that they can trust you by being worthy of that trust.  You can come home before curfew, or clean up without having to be asked, or babysit for families in your neighborhood, for example."}, {"instruction": "Before curfew? You've got to be kidding!", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "My curfew is eleven-thirty, and good parties are never over until three in the morning.", "input": "", "output": "Well, you have to make some hard decisions. You can either party all night, or you can try to get your parents to respect and trust you."}, {"instruction": "I guess.", "input": "", "output": "How's school?"}, {"instruction": "Fine. I got my report card last week.", "input": "", "output": "How did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I got three A's, two B's, a C, and an F.", "input": "", "output": "What subjects were you taking?"}, {"instruction": "Well, A's were for Drama, Choir, and English.", "input": "", "output": "What about the other grades?"}, {"instruction": "I got B's in Algebra II and History. And I got a C in Chemistry.", "input": "", "output": "And the F?"}, {"instruction": "P.E.", "input": "", "output": "Physical Education?"}, {"instruction": "They wanted me to write a summary of an article on volleyball. I got an article off the Internet, and they said it didn't count.", "input": "", "output": "You have to write reports for P.E.?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Isn't it stupid? It's something about blending in English with all the other classes. But we don't do it in any other class.", "input": "", "output": "I see. I have to admit that I didn't do all that well in P.E. myself.  And other than grades, how is school?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I made a superior on my solo for Choir. Next week, we'll be going to Chicago to perform at a competition.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like fun."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I'm supposed to room with these two girls from Choir. I always thought they were snobs, but they turned out to be pretty nice.", "input": "", "output": "People can fool you."}, {"instruction": "Well, Amber and Janna--the girls I'm rooming with--invited me to go shopping with them for clothes for the trip.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Oh, something else major is going on at school.", "input": "", "output": "What is it?"}, {"instruction": "I'm running for Second Vice President of next year's Junior Class.", "input": "", "output": "That's great. How did you decide to get involved in school politics?"}, {"instruction": "Amber, Janna, and Shawn. They said that they were running, too. Amber is running for First Vice President, Janna is running for Treasurer, and Shawn is running for President. If we win, we'll be all together.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. But I doubt that I'll win. I know that Amber, Janna, and Shawn will, but I might not.", "input": "", "output": "How do you know that they will win?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Janna and Amber are co-captains of JV cheerleading. They are two of the most popular girls in my grade, and they are really smart. Shawn is on the football and basketball teams. He has a 3.76 GPA, and every girl at school thinks he is sweet and funny.", "input": "", "output": "And what about you, Nicole?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know my GPA right off, but I know that I'm not as qualified as they are.", "input": "", "output": "Do your friends think you'll win?"}, {"instruction": "They say I will.", "input": "", "output": "And do they think they will win?"}, {"instruction": "No. They keep on saying that they doubt that they'll win. I guess we all believe in each other but not in ourselves.", "input": "", "output": "That happens often. Is there anything else going on at school?"}, {"instruction": "I tried out for cheerleading.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "I made it.", "input": "", "output": "Did Janna and Amber try out?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. They made it, too.", "input": "", "output": "Who's the captain?"}, {"instruction": "Two Junior snobs named Marty Anderson and Vaughn Johannsen. Nobody likes them.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Because they aren't nice. They walk by people and make fun of them. I've gone to school with them since preschool, and after they made cheerleading in seventh grade, they went from being super sweet to being super snobs.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that making cheerleading changed them?"}, {"instruction": "It went to their heads. Yeah, definitely. They made the dance team in sixth grade and kind of got snobbier. But cheerleading made them even bigger snobs.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you'll change?"}, {"instruction": "I hope not.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have to do some special training?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "When does that start?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I have to go to three camps. They'll be in June and July. The first one will begin in five days. I might have a schedule for you next time.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. I just noticed that your hair isn't cherry red anymore."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I got the red stuff to come out. I decided that since I didn't like my dark brown hair, I would dye it kind of a golden blonde. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "It looks nice."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And I'll get my hair cut this afternoon, too--bad split ends, see?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "This is strange, I'm talking about split ends with my doctor. Have I gone crazy?", "input": "", "output": "For the most part, I believe you are a normal teenager."}, {"instruction": "Me? Normal? You must not know me very well.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Because I am not normal.", "input": "", "output": "You seem pretty normal to me."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm not!", "input": "", "output": "What makes you abnormal?"}, {"instruction": "Well...I'm just a good actress, so that's why you don't see it.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What are you working on in your Drama Class?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing. But History has gotten interesting lately. My history teacher is into Titanic stuff. We watched all the movies and listened to the music from the latest movie. We also watched a lot of documentaries and read stories about the Titanic. So it's interesting.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I wonder if she'll buy us posters from the new Titanic movie.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I need a new poster for my room--I took down all my weird ones.", "input": "", "output": "You took all your old posters down? Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when I was on drugs, I painted my room black and had all these weird posters on the walls. Now that I am not doing drugs, I've redone my room. It's still black, but I took some other colors and kind of splashed them on the walls and all around. It's really pretty now. Well, I need to go.", "input": "", "output": "Have fun in Chicago. I hope you win your competition."}, {"instruction": "I'll try. Bye, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Nicole."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "How are you today?"}, {"instruction": "Fine.", "input": "", "output": "And your mono?"}, {"instruction": "Gone with the wind. I've been feeling better for about a week and a half. I'm still weak, but today I feel like I'm on top of the world!", "input": "", "output": "Good. How is your social life? How are you and your boyfriend doing?"}, {"instruction": "Wonderful. Do you know what?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "On the night of the prom, he came over and made me chicken soup and brought two of my favorite movies: \"Romeo & Juliet\" and \"Clueless.\" Wasn't that sweet of him?", "input": "", "output": "Have you two been out on a date since you got well?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not on a real date. But every Friday, he comes over and helps with dinner. He is so sweet. Last night, he came over with cookie dough ice cream and sat on the front porch with me and we ate it together. I think I am in love!", "input": "", "output": "Really? How does he feel about you?"}, {"instruction": "He hasn't told me he loves me yet. But I know he does.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you think so?"}, {"instruction": "Trust me, he does.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Well, please tell me what's been going on in your life."}, {"instruction": "Well, Angie's grandmother called my mom and told her that Angie left rehab and ran away last week. Doctor Balis, she could be anywhere, doing anything. Part of me thinks she'll come back and be sober and all, but I know...I just know that when...if she comes back, she'll be as high as a kite. She'll probably be pregnant, too. And I'm not going to go with her to that clinic again.", "input": "", "output": "Clinic?"}, {"instruction": "A few months ago, she made me take her to a clinic so she could get an abortion.", "input": "", "output": "Oh.  Did her grandmother know about the abortion?"}, {"instruction": "She said that Angie couldn't have the baby. Actually, she said it in a far more vibrant way. Her grandmother called her a slut and told Angie that she couldn't stay with her if she kept the baby.", "input": "", "output": "I see. How do you feel about abortion?"}, {"instruction": "It's her body. I can't make her decisions for her. Personally, I would never do it, but it was her choice not mine.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Do you feel that Angie's grandmother pushed her into having..."}, {"instruction": "I'd rather talk about something else, Doctor. Kiersten McKenna and Monica Talianko have befriended me. They think that I am so perfect. They are such airheads. I'm serious. They think two plus two is twelve. If you looked in the dictionary under ditzy, their pictures--along with practically the rest of the squad--would be there staring you right smack in the face. I mean it! Do you know what I've learned since becoming a cheerleader?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Preps' and jocks' parties are a lot like druggies', except with lots more money.", "input": "", "output": "Didn't you used to go to jocks' parties?"}, {"instruction": "No, I would go crash frat parties. It's where the cool stuff went on!", "input": "", "output": "Do you go to these parties now?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I did before I got sick, but I'm going to one tonight.", "input": "", "output": "Do you do drugs and drink alcohol there?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes I drink the little cocktail-type things. But mostly, I just drink water.", "input": "", "output": "And do you do drugs?"}, {"instruction": "No way! Not now, not ever!", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes it's harder than others to say no. Once, I almost did, but I went to the bathroom and splashed myself with water to make myself remember...and then I thought about Angie. I thought about how we used to go to parties and get trashed, and then we would go to the bathrooms to get sick and all. Sometimes, we'd wake up in beds that weren't ours and not knowing what happened. We could've just been drunk and nothing happened. But sometimes, I thought something else might have...", "input": "", "output": "Are you talking about being rape?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I know that I've slept with a few guys in my life. But when I was getting trashed all the time, a guy really didn't have to rape me to get me in bed. He could just suggest it to me, and I'd go for it. Sometimes, I'd get some cocaine or something for it. That was mostly from the rich frat boys. But sometimes, I'd get drugs from slum guys, too.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever been tested for HIV?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I don't have it, luckily for me. If the guys I slept with had it, they used protection.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever been pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "No. But lately I've been thinking about having a baby with my boyfriend. He'd make a good dad. He told me he wants kids, but he didn't really say with whom.", "input": "", "output": "A baby is..."}, {"instruction": "A baby is a big responsibility. I know. But I want one so bad. I want to get married to him, and have kids, and live with him forever!", "input": "", "output": "I see. Do you think he wants the same thing?"}, {"instruction": "We've talked about it a lot. He said that when I was ready, we could try to...I mean, he said he is ready to have a baby.

I'll start in November.", "input": "", "output": "So you want to have a baby by this time next year?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Nicole..."}, {"instruction": "And I'll need you, Doctor. You need to help me tell my parents about this. I'll need to talk it over with them of course.", "input": "", "output": "Of course."}, {"instruction": "I need to become closer to his parents, too. We know it's a big responsibility, and I'll need your help to get ready for it, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Nicole, I don't..."}, {"instruction": "I know.
