I can't hear you."}, {"instruction": "Where would you like me to sit?", "input": "", "output": "Wherever you feel the most comfortable, Ms. Alvidrez."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. Nina. Please call me Nina.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Nina. I'm pleased to meet you. How may I help you?"}, {"instruction": "Um.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my mom thinks you can help me.", "input": "", "output": "How so, Nina?"}, {"instruction": "She wants me to keep my job.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Where do you work?"}, {"instruction": "At SII. I work with my mother.", "input": "", "output": "What do you do?"}, {"instruction": "I'm just a secretary.", "input": "", "output": "Have you worked there long?"}, {"instruction": "Just a month.", "input": "", "output": "Do you work directly with your mother?"}, {"instruction": "No, she has a good job working for Mr. Majors...sorry, I mean Mr. Major. She has been working for him for a long time. She arranged for my job.", "input": "", "output": "That was nice of her. Do you enjoy working near your mother?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes. Mama is so wonderful. She is always so happy. She is like a little bird--she's always singing and flitting around.", "input": "", "output": "You seem quite fond of your mother."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I love her very much. I'm not her favorite, though.", "input": "", "output": "You have siblings?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, my sister Maria is the oldest. Then there's my sister Alba, then me, and then my brother Rico--he's the youngest.", "input": "", "output": "Nina, would you tell me about your job? What do you do there? How do you like it?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I answer the phone for Mr. Utterman and handle his correspondence. I filter out the sales calls and direct them to the proper sales person. I do other things like typing and filing. Mr. Utterman doesn't like me very much. I think I make too many mistakes and that upsets him.", "input": "", "output": "You think you make too many mistakes?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. This is my first real job, and it's real important to Mama that I do well. But...", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think it is so important to your mother?"}, {"instruction": "I want to make her proud of me.", "input": "", "output": "Yes. But that's not what you said. Why is it important to your mother that you do well? Is she..."}, {"instruction": "Um, Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I'd like to go now. I don't really think this is a good idea.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I just...I have a hard time with new people, and you make me nervous. I'm sorry! I didn't mean to insult you. See? I just end up putting my foot in my mouth and making things worse all the time.", "input": "", "output": "Don't worry about insulting me, Nina. I'm a very easy-going person. I understand that sometimes a first therapy session is very hard for people. It's not always easy to meet new people, therapists in particular; it can often be scary. But we can take it very slowly and go at your pace. So let's give it another try. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "I don't...is it scary for you, too?", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes it is. But I remind myself that once I get past the hard part of meeting a person, I can anticipate learning new things from them. You can think of new friendships as adventures."}, {"instruction": "Adventures?", "input": "", "output": "Well, just think of all the things you can learn from a new person. By spending time together, you can share with another person who you are and they can share with you."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. That is an interesting way of looking at it.", "input": "", "output": "I would like for you to come back again next week so we can continue working together. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Next week? Oh, no! I couldn't do that.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Why don't we schedule an appointment for every other week then? It will be just one hour every two weeks.  That's all right, isn't it?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I can do that.", "input": "", "output": "Wonderful.  How about this same time, but two weeks from now, okay?"}, {"instruction": "All right.  But I really do need to go now, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. But in the future, we will need to finish a full session. That's one hour, all right?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Nina."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "It's good to see you again. I've been looking forward to our session today."}, {"instruction": "You have?", "input": "", "output": "I'm looking forward to having a chance to get to know you. But I realize how hard it must be for you to share your life with a complete stranger. It takes a certain amount of courage to do that."}, {"instruction": "I guess.", "input": "", "output": "It's been awhile since our last session, so let's get started. How was your Independence Day holiday? I understand SII had a get-together."}, {"instruction": "Yes, they did. But I...uh, I didn't go.", "input": "", "output": "Really?  Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Why go? I don't really know anybody. And most of them hate me anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think people at SII hate you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, those who don't hate me just haven't had a chance to meet me yet. Once they will, I'm sure they wouldn't want me around.", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think that's rather extreme? Do you know anyone in particular who doesn't like you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, actually...I just don't fit in. I don't do things right and am always making mistakes. I'm sure everyone thinks I'm stupid. Besides, why should anyone want to be around me? My mother works for Mr. Major; I'm sure people think I'm his spy.", "input": "", "output": "Everyone makes mistakes when they start a new job. That's to be expected..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I just can't seem to get it right.", "input": "", "output": "Do you ever ask for clarification or assistance?"}, {"instruction": "Oh no! That would show them just how stupid I was. I couldn't do that. I don't dare. Oh no. I wouldn't dare ask anyone for help. I ask my mother sometimes because I trust her. But she's usually busy doing other things and doesn't really have time for me.", "input": "", "output": "I see. You know, a company picnic would have been a perfect place to meet the people you work with in a very informal and stress free..."}, {"instruction": "I'd really rather not talk about this, Doctor Balis. I don't mean to be rude, but it's not something that I want to discuss.", "input": "", "output": "Don't get upset, Nina. I'm just trying to understand why a company picnic would make you feel so unhappy. Would you mind explaining it to me a bit more, please?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I get so nervous around other people, even at family gatherings. For the Fourth of July, we had a big family party at my house. I ended up spending most of the time just watching them from my window.", "input": "", "output": "Does your family make you nervous?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really...not all of them, anyway. I have many distant cousins. Someone in my family is always getting married or has a new person in their life. It's those ones--the ones that I'm not familiar with--that make me feel...", "input": "", "output": "Scared?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. What if I walk out there and trip and fall flat on my face? It would be mortifying. They'd all think I was stupid and clumsy, and they would all laugh at me. I just couldn't handle that.", "input": "", "output": "These new people in your family, has there been anyone that you've gotten to know over time?"}, {"instruction": "There are a few. My Uncle Hector got married seven or eight years ago. His wife--my Aunt Alana--is very nice. She and I are friends now, I guess. I was around ten when they got married. I haven't had as much luck with other people who have come into our family.", "input": "", "output": "How come?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Rico's girlfriends never like me. They are always looking down their noses at me. I'm just not pretty enough to be their friend, I suppose. And then most of those date-types who attend family functions are so transient anyway. Why spend the time getting to know them just to have them snub me and then disappear forever?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. In our last session, we talked about the benefit of gaining knowledge and experience by meeting new people. Sometimes,  it won't be pleasant. But it's not because of you and who you are. I think you'd be surprised to know just how many people around you have been hurt or snubbed by others in their lives. The important thing is to keep trying and not give up because of one bad experience. The world is a lonely place when you separate yourself from it. Wouldn't you agree?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, it does get lonely. I just feel so overshadowed by...uh, Doctor Balis? You won't share any of this with my mother, will you?", "input": "", "output": "What is said here stays between us. I will not tell your mother what we discuss, Nina. What is said here is kept in the strictest confidence. I'm bound by the rules of ethics which govern psychiatrists to keep your confidences.  It's kind of a sacred trust, like that between a priest and a penitent.  Anyway, your mother won't find out what we talk about here."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. You see I know my parents just wouldn't understand. I guess they can see it a bit, but I try to hide it.", "input": "", "output": "What are you trying to hide?"}, {"instruction": "I just feel so overshadowed by Rico. They baby him so much. He never gets in trouble. I know it sounds childish and petty, but he really is the favorite.", "input": "", "output": "The favorite?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. And why not? He's so good at everything. It's like he has the golden touch. He can do no wrong. I don't seem to be as...I don't know...as talented as he is. He's like Mama; he has a way of making a room light up by simply smiling. You can't help but like him.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think makes you are so different from your brother?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not like him. I'm not good at anything, Doctor Balis. Have you seen \"Boogie Nights?\"", "input": "", "output": "Pardon me?"}, {"instruction": "The movie. Have you seen \"Boogie Nights?\"", "input": "", "output": "No, I didn't see it."}, {"instruction": "I really liked that movie. There's this character, Dirk...anyway, when Dirk fought with his mother, that was great. He said that he was going to be a star, a bright shining star. And he made it. He said that everyone has something special, but I think he was wrong there.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I think some people are just plain old boring.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know anyone like that?"}, {"instruction": "Huh?", "input": "", "output": "Well, is there anyone you can remember from school or can you think of a co-worker who you think of as boring? Do you know someone who lacks some special ability or a talent?"}, {"instruction": "Um...well, I never really thought about...", "input": "", "output": "Think back to high school. Can you recall anyone?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the computer club geeks were pretty boring.", "input": "", "output": "Let's be more specific. Can you think of a particular person from that computer club who was completely talentless and without any special abilities?"}, {"instruction": "Um, Tony Wendell was pretty boring. He was always doing things in the computer lab.", "input": "", "output": "Was he good with computers?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so. He was always trying to show me programs he developed.", "input": "", "output": "Would you say that he had a knack for computers?"}, {"instruction": "I see what you're saying, Doctor Balis. Computers were his special ability.", "input": "", "output": "I think when you look close, you'll find that everyone has a particular ability that makes him or her unique and special."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. So for example you--I think you are a very good listener. I know that some wouldn't think that was important. But I bet it's your special ability and it probably helps you help your patients.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you..."}, {"instruction": "But then look at you, Doctor Balis. You're a handsome, well dressed, and intelligent man. You are very sure of yourself. Your confidence makes me jealous.", "input": "", "output": "Nina..."}, {"instruction": "I don't like being the way I am. I don't like who I am.", "input": "", "output": "Here are some tissues, Nina. Would you like a drink of water?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'll be fine.", "input": "", "output": "Take some deep breaths. Try to concentrate on steadying your breathing. There, much better."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "It's all right. We've been discussing some very difficult topics. And you've done wonderfully. It takes a lot of courage to share your innermost feelings."}, {"instruction": "I feel like I can trust you, Doctor Balis, and I don't trust people quickly or easily.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Nina. Now, we've had a very good session today. I'm very proud of you for sticking it out for the whole thing."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. It was hard.", "input": "", "output": "I know."}, {"instruction": "So, I'll see you in two weeks?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, that's July 30th at 10 am."}, {"instruction": "I'll be there, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Nina. Please call me if you need anything."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis. Have a nice day.", "input": "", "output": "You too."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Good morning, Nina. Please come in."}, {"instruction": "I can't stay long today, Doctor Balis. I'm really sorry.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Mr. Utterman needs a proposal edited and finalized. I have to do all the formatting and make sure it fits with all the company's standards. He also needs some overheads created. It takes a while to get all the color copies made, so I need to get them done as soon as possible.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Well, I appreciate your effort to make your appointment today, Nina. How long will you be able to stay?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Mr. Utterman doesn't even know that I've left the building.", "input": "", "output": "Does he know of your therapy appointments?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he's usually not in the office at this time--he has a senior staff meeting. He doesn't even realize that I'm gone.", "input": "", "output": "It might be a good idea to make him aware of your appointments. I'm sure he'd understand..."}, {"instruction": "Uh, I'd rather not, Doctor Balis. He doesn't need to know, does he? I think that I might end up losing my job if he thought I was a nut case...uh, not that everyone who sees you is a nut case...I mean...", "input": "", "output": "It's quite all right, Nina. I know what you mean. But it might be possible that his reaction would be a favorable one--SII has been very good about letting its employees seek..."}, {"instruction": "Really, I'd rather that he didn't know.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Nina, if you have a few minutes, I would like to ask you a few questions."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "If you could chose, what would be your dream profession? What could you do that would make you feel comfortable?"}, {"instruction": "I would prefer almost anything where I didn't have to deal with people so much. I hate answering the phone all the time. Some of the people are so pushy. Even the sales people in our department are pushy. I always feel like the sales department welcome mat: come on in, grab your messages, walk all over me, and then be on your merry way.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I think I'd like a job that would allow me to work at home. I hate having to go out to work. I'd much rather be at home.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel that way about other tasks you need to perform outside of your home such as grocery shopping or running errands?"}, {"instruction": "Well, sure. Life would be much easier if I never had to leave the house. I guess I can have my groceries delivered at home. And I can order clothes from catalogs. There are all sorts of other home delivery things. Did you know that you can order your meals over the Internet from this place called CyberMeals? You can even do your grocery shopping online. There's a company called PeaPod that works with local grocers and handles it all. It's kind of like TakeOut Taxi or Restaurants On The Run, except these are not on the Internet.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. You sound like you've researched this issue. What keeps you from staying home all the time?"}, {"instruction": "My mother. When I was a kid, she'd lock us all out of the house in the Summer and tell us that if the sun was shining, we had no business being indoors. I hated it. I used to bring my books outside and read until dinner time. Alba thought I was crazy to want to read all day, but she sat with me and read to me sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Reading is a wonderful way to experience the world, especially parts of the world I'll never visit.", "input": "", "output": "I agree."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, why am I so afraid of people?", "input": "", "output": "Are you afraid of them or are you afraid of yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Of them, I think. I've read books about raising horses, touring Paris, women's liberation during the industrial era of America, double agents during World War II....but it all seems so distant. Even though I know these books are relating historical information, it feels like a fantasy to me. I don't think I can ever be part of the world I've read about.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think this is true? Why do you think you feel this way?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, Doctor. I really don't.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps we can work on allowing you to become a more active participant rather than just an observer of people and events around you."}, {"instruction": "Hmm, I'll think about that, Doctor Balis. Oh my God! Look at the time! Oh no! Doctor Balis, I'm so sorry, but I really have to go. I didn't realize that so much time had gone by. I hope Mr. Utterman didn't leave his meeting to look for me. I really need to go.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Nina. Good luck with the project."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. I'll see you in two weeks, Doctor Balis. Thanks for understanding.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Nina."}, {"instruction": "I'm okay. How are you doing?", "input": "", "output": "I'm well, thank you. How have the past two weeks been for you?"}, {"instruction": "It's the same old thing, Doctor Balis. There's nothing incredible to speak of.", "input": "", "output": "How is work?"}, {"instruction": "Not good, actually. Oh God, I can't believe I'm crying. It's just that...It seems to get worse every day. Mr. Utterman is evil.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He makes me so miserable. He never has a kind word, never says \"thank you,\" or tells anyone that they've done a good job. It's horrid working for him. I work directly for him, and I can go for almost two weeks without saying a word to him. He's too busy and too important for the likes of me. We communicate almost completely by e-mail. How hard is it to get up from your desk and walk over to me? He's so snappish and curt. I just don't think I can take much more of this.", "input": "", "output": "Have you tried to tell him how unhappy you are?"}, {"instruction": "What good would it do? He's such a perfectionist. He probably thinks I'm too stupid to understand anything he says. He's always snapping at me. He has his pet people, and I'm obviously not one of them.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to be?"}, {"instruction": "I'd like to be recognized for my hard work. I'm only a secretary, but I do work hard. If I weren't there, most of the sales people would be in a bind. Support staff is important, but not at SII. My mother doesn't see it because she works so closely with Mr. Major, but most of the secretaries are treated like dirt. I wish I could work at home like some of the programmers do. It would make life so much easier.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been having problems with Mr. Utterman all along or is this a new turn of events?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, when I first started at SII, I didn't even get a computer for two weeks! For the first two weeks, I sat at my desk and took messages. That's it. I think I spoke to Mr. Utterman a total of ten minutes during all of those two weeks. It was so demoralizing. He didn't even introduce me to the rest of the group during our staff meeting. I felt so alone.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I just don't need to be treated like this.", "input": "", "output": "Have you given any thought as to how you can remedy the situation?"}, {"instruction": "Yes--I thought of just jumping off the building.", "input": "", "output": "That seems a bit drastic."}, {"instruction": "It would take care of quite a few problems, though.", "input": "", "output": "When did you first think of solving your problems that way?"}, {"instruction": "My first week. It's just a pipe dream, I'm sure.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Do you think about ending your life often?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm...everyday, I suppose. It's there, in the back of my mind, every morning when we get out of the car and go into that building. I look up and just stare at the roof for a few moments. Sometimes, Mama has to call my name to get my attention...", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you might ever resort to taking your own life?"}, {"instruction": "I'm too much of a chicken.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "My sister, Maria, is always saying that one day I'm just going to snap and start killing people.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think she seriously believes that?"}, {"instruction": "It seems like she does.  It really hurts to know that my own sister thinks I could hurt other people. I'm not a violent person, Doctor Balis. Ever since that one day, she's never been the same to me.", "input": "", "output": "Which day is that, Nina?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose I should tell you. I don't like to talk about it. My whole family pretends that it never happened.", "input": "", "output": "Please, go on."}, {"instruction": "In February of my senior high school year, I was pretty sad. I cried all the time and for no reason--if someone looked cross-eyed at me, I cried. Maria was working as an accountant for a legal firm at the time. She had her own place and would let me stay there with her for days at a time when I needed to. I had a hard time in school with friends and teachers. I really felt ostracized. Maria came home and found me...", "input": "", "output": "Here are some tissues, Nina. Take your time."}, {"instruction": "I was sitting in the middle of the kitchen floor. I had taken some scissors and hacked off my hair, cut off my fingernails--I tore at my fingers with my teeth until my nail-beds were bleeding. And then I cut my arms and legs. Maria flipped. She called 911 and got me to the hospital. I didn't feel any pain until the next day. No one ever asked me about it. The hospital wanted to admit me to the psychiatric ward, but my parents refused. Ever since then, Maria hasn't been the same towards me.", "input": "", "output": "It must have been a shock for her to see how you had hurt yourself. Have you tried to talk to her about it?"}, {"instruction": "No. No one in the family has spoken of the incident since it happened. For a while, it was like I had an assigned babysitter--someone was with me 24 hours a day. They even had Alba move into my room so she could sleep near me. They've loosened up since then, but I know they all expect me to go postal at any time.", "input": "", "output": "Have you felt an urge to hurt yourself that way again?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, I can feel the darkness starting to overwhelm me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "It starts when nothing makes me smile. I feel more and more like I'm on the outside looking in. And then I get sad. It's the sadness that is the worst.", "input": "", "output": "Do you try to bring yourself out of this darkness?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. Other times, I just ride with it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "My mom knows when I start to feel it. I start taking long, super-hot showers several times a day. When she notices the showers starting, the whole family goes back into babysitter mode.", "input": "", "output": "Your family is very concerned about you."}, {"instruction": "Yes, they do love me. But I just don't fit in with them. Sometimes, I feel like an alien--part of them, but not part of them. Doctor Balis, this discussion has really made me tired. Is it time to stop yet?", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "Please, Doctor.  I'm very tired.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like taking long hot showers now?"}, {"instruction": "No, no. I don't feel like I'm even close to being at that stage.  Really, Doctor. I will tell you if I do feel the darkness coming on, all right?  Can I please go now?", "input": "", "output": "All right. We can stop. I know it's been a hard session for you, and I appreciate the effort, Nina."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you in two weeks then.", "input": "", "output": "Please call me anytime if you need to talk. If you feel the darkness again, call me immediately and I'll help you work through it. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "I will, Doctor. I promise. Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Nina.  Please take care of yourself, and I'll see you soon."}]
