Sorry.  It is all so... so...I don't know...Strange!  I mean being in your office and stuff.  It seems more awkward than seeing a gynecologist.

By the way, it shows that you just started.", "input": "", "output": "I beg your pardon, started what?"}, {"instruction": "Your office, I mean.  You don't even have a plant yet.  I am very good with plants, you know.  A couple of orchids and maybe a crawler or two.  It would really tell your patients you care.  My gynecologist uses pillows and a heating pad, you know.  And we all notice.  The patients I mean.  In any case, orchids are easy, just water them a couple of times a week and make sure they don't get too much sun--they will burn.  But you have to give them some sun or they will not flower.  Maybe next time I will bring you a starter orchid kit.", "input": "", "output": "That's very nice of you.

In your insurance form you mentioned that you have trouble concentrating at work and you haven't been sleeping well."}, {"instruction": "Oh, it's just been a disaster.  I can't turn my mind off.  I keep talking with him.  Just all the time non stop.  Really long, meaningful conversations about life and stuff.  I try to stop, but the moment I stop thinking about not thinking, I just go right into these conversations again.

Did I tell you?", "input": "", "output": "Not yet."}, {"instruction": "You see--no ability to concentrate or keep my mind on what I am saying.  I am just like this all the time now.  At work, someone would ask me something and I would start to answer but in the middle I would forget what the question was.  Every one is trying to be nice to me, I know.  But Caren, the girl friend I have been telling you about, the one that told me to go and see someone, before I get fired that is...what was I saying?  Oh, Caren.  Yes, she told me that I am now just impossible to talk to, like talking to the wall, you know.  I think she said the wall, I don't remember.  In any case, she keeps saying that I don't listen or listen and don't hear.  And I know that this is true, but all I can think about is him and how it is too bad that it did not work out.  And I know that he will regret it eventually.  But by that time it will be too late.  And it just does not help me now, you know?  Well, it does help a little.  I imagine the conversation we will have when he comes to his senses: him crying and all that because he realized that I was the one and me feeling sorry for him but distant, you know, not really caring. When I get to feel really bad, I just start to think about this conversation and I immediately start to feel a little bit better.

You spend all of your time in this one place.  20 hours a day with the same people.  I am exaggerating, but just a bit.  The company does demand total commitment.  And we all have slept there on an occasion or two.  Not that I mind.  I like that.  I like what I do, you know.  Not many women are in this profession.  Well, now there may be more.  But not many more.  I remember being the only one in my classes in college.  Not that I cared that much.  But it is kinda cool.  In any case, there are just a few women in my position in the company.  There are other women of course, in management or secretaries...", "input": "", "output": "So he works for the same company?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes.  As I was saying, we all work very hard and sometimes just too much.  It seems a lot of people in the company have relationships with each other.  We have...we don't see anyone else.  All our lives are entangled in our projects.  So when you try to date someone from the outside, they just don't understand.  Plus you would never get to see them, you know.  So we all date each other.  Sometimes it gets really weird, you now.  This one guy from my department was married to Suzy from Customer Relations, and now they are divorced.  They both still work for the company.  But now she is dating this other guy also an engineer, but from a different team.  Everyone has seen them kissing in the corners.  I bet they even did it in the lounge area, on the couch.  Not that I care.  I did it myself, you know.  It is not bad.  Kind of exciting.  But not very comfortable.  But it is killing Bob.  He sees Suzy and just turns sort of gray.  I think I have even seen him cry.  But I did not want to look.  I wanted him to have his privacy, you know.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel when you see Bill around?"}, {"instruction": "I try not to be in the same place at the same time, you know.

If one of them sees him walking in my direction, they signal for someone else to distract me away some where.  It's quite sweet, you know.  But I know what they are doing, even though I pretend that I don't notice.  It helps to know that other people care.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it does.  You were telling me about Bill."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, Bill.  Well, he started to work for the company a few years after I did.  I was on vacation.  But I knew before I left that they were going to hire someone.  We were working on this project and there just wasn't enough people.  It was crazy.  So it finally dawned on someone up in management that perhaps another person was needed.  In any case, my part of the project was done and I really needed some rest.  So I went to Disneyland, of course!  I don't know what I was thinking.  It was hot and tons of people.  You had to stand in line for everything.  But when you finally got on the ride it was cool.  Disney really knows how to put on the show, you know.", "input": "", "output": "So Bill was hired when you were on vacation?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.

John seemed to think that he was okay--they all went out for lunch a couple of times.  Well, I had tons of work to do plus I was itching everywhere, my skin was just beginning to peel--I got burned pretty badly standing in lines for the rides at Disney.  I knew I should have used the sun block.  But they are just so, so... icky!  So I got burned.  No one to blame but myself.  So I was working and itching and this new guy just comes over and asks me to go to lunch with him.  I was so embarrassed about the itching that I said yes.  So that's how we met.", "input": "", "output": "What does he do?"}, {"instruction": "Bill is working on the internet development team.

Please tell me more about your relationship with Bill."}, {"instruction": "Well, I am not sure where to start.  It sort of happened, you know.  First we went out on one lunch, the next thing you know we are spending all our free time together.  Caren kept on asking me at that time whether we were going out or what?  But frankly I did not know.  Then one evening after the company's baseball game...you know, they make us do it.  I personally hate those game.  It is good for those who play well, and for people like Suzy.  She has huge breasts, you know.  And looks really good in those t-shirts they make us wear.  I think she must have asked for a size smaller.  She really looks outrageous in it.  Suzy is on our cheerleading team, and when she cheers everyone watches, you know.", "input": "", "output": "So what happened at this game?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the game was no big deal.  You know, the usual.  Suzy jumped up and down a lot.  John hurt his shoulder as he does every time.  You know, I think he just pretends to hurt his shoulder so he doesn't have to play.  They made me try to hit the ball.  So I almost killed Julian, my boss.  You'll think they've learned by now!", "input": "", "output": "And what about Bill?"}, {"instruction": "Bill is a good player, you know.  I also think he must have tried to show off for me, you know.  In any case, after the game we all went back to our cars.  I was parked way in the back because I did not get there till later, I had some work to finish up.  Plus I am never eager to be there in the first place.  So I was walking back to my car and he caught up with me.  He asked me what I thought of the game.  I said it was okay.  Not my thing, you know.  Then he asked me what I thought of how my boyfriend played.  Well I just stopped dead cold in my tracks.  That was a hell of a way of asking me to go out with him.", "input": "", "output": "Were you offended?"}, {"instruction": "Well, no.  I actually thought it was kind of romantic, in a sick kind of way.  I told Caren about it that night and she thought it was rude of him to make the assumption that I would say yes, even if he thought I would.", "input": "", "output": "But you didn't mind?"}, {"instruction": "No.  As I said, I thought it was nice.  In any case, that softball field sort of became our place.  We would drive there after work and sit and watch the sunset and, you know...I feel sort of embarrassed.", "input": "", "output": "Please don't be."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  I am just very new at this.  Well, at first we would just sit there on the benches and look at the sky and talk.  Then we would kiss.  Bill is a good kisser.  Then, then...well, it was dark so we did not think anyone could really see us.  I also don't think we particularly cared.  Well, he would unzip his pants...well, I never really had oral sex before.  Is it okay to talk about this?", "input": "", "output": "Of course."}, {"instruction": "Well, I read about it in romance novels, like everyone else.  But the books I read were never that explicit, you know.  They just talked about the pleasure of the moment and ecstasy and paradise, but never really about the mechanics, you know.  What goes into what.  So I never really assumed you would just put it in your mouth.  And here he was, taking it out of his pants and showing it to me.  So I kissed it.", "input": "", "output": "And then?"}, {"instruction": "At first that was it.  But later I told Caren about it.  And she asked if I sucked it.  I said, \"What?\"  I didn't think people really did that.  They don't teach you in school about it, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Did it seem like a bad thing to you?"}, {"instruction": "I was shocked to hear about it, at first.  But the following day I could not wait for the evening to come.  We met after work as usual and went out for pizza.  After, he wanted to go home because he had a business trip in the morning.  But I did not want to wait a couple of days to try this out.  So I insisted.", "input": "", "output": "And what happened?"}, {"instruction": "He was very surprised.  And I mean very.", "input": "", "output": "Did you like it?"}, {"instruction": "A lot!", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "I told Caren about it and she called me a slut.

It's nice to see you again.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you.  It's nice to see you too.  Please sit down."}, {"instruction": "I see you still haven't gotten any plants.  Remember what I told you:  your patients will notice these kind of things, you know.", "input": "", "output": "I remember.  But I have been very busy this week.  Now please, you have been telling me about your relationship with Bill."}, {"instruction": "Oh God!  I think I have been telling more than that.  When I got into the car, after I left your office that is, I could not believe what I was saying to you.  You must think I have an oral fixation or something.  How embarrassing.  When I told Caren what I told you, she said that you now must think that I have some sort of sexual obsessions.  I hate to think what you wrote about me in your journal.  I really am shy, you know.  It's just you made it so easy for me to talk.  And all I really need is an opportunity to talk and I just take off.  I probably need even less than that.  I just need to think that I have an opportunity.", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Green, you really needn't worry about what I put in my notes or that I will form a bad opinion about you.  This is not what this is all about.  When you have a flu and go and see your regular doctor, do you think that your doctor will think badly of you for being sick?"}, {"instruction": "No, of course not.  But I don't talk about oral sex with the doctor either.  But, oh well.  You're right.  You are here to help me.  And I do need help, you know.  I am just obsessed.  And these crying fits...", "input": "", "output": "What crying fits?"}, {"instruction": "You see?  I talk to you about oral sex and don't even mention that I have been a living Niagara Falls for the last couple of weeks.", "input": "", "output": "So you have been crying a lot?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my mind just races all the time.  I have these exhausting conversations with Bill.  He was my best friend, you know.  If I had problems with work or something, I would talk to him about it.  If I read a book I liked, I would sometimes cuddle-up with him and read him that book through the night.  Now, after all that happened, after finding out about everything, I still sort of find that I need to talk to him about it.  Stupid, isn't it?  Here he was this horrible bastard to me and I still want to talk to him about it.  Tell him about this beastly man Bill that hurt me so much and lied to me.  It's insane.  And it is twenty-four hours a day.  And my mind jumps from talking to him about him to talking with him when he is begging me to come back.  My nerves are all just jumbled up.  I could cry at the drop of a hat, so to speak.  Just look at me.  I don't normally look like that, you know.  I am not a Suzy, but I am quite good looking, you know.  Did I talk to you about Suzy?", "input": "", "output": "You did."}, {"instruction": "God, I am glad that my memory is all trashed too.  I hate to think what else I talked to you about.  And of course talking to you about...you know.", "input": "", "output": "How much have you been crying?"}, {"instruction": "You mean like a real estimate?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "Well, my work days are about nine hours now.  This is not including lunch.  I have been so screwed up that it takes me much longer to do anything.  For example, I have been working on setting up some text data, and...you know how it is.  You can never get simple data format from the editors.  They always have to format it, just a little bit.  You think these people will ever learn.  We've been doing this for years.  During every project we have these discussions about what we all would like from each other.  You know, they would like us to do all the programming by yesterday and we would like them to think through the design and the interface and the data beforehand.  If they did their part right, we would only have to write one program per project instead of thousands of variations on the same theme.  And they never seem to understand that every \"can we just change this one little thing?\" takes time.  Sometimes \"the one little thing\" means redoing hundreds of hours of work, you know.  But actually I am pretty easygoing about changes.  I can see how the final product gets better and better with each iteration.  It's a process.  John, on the other hand.  He always says that if they just listened to him in the first place, it would have come out the same.  Personally I don't think so.  But this is just John's way of coping with frustration, I think.  Fuming about, that is.  Well.  He is a good programmer though.  Probably better then me.  [Pause]  What was I talking about?  Before this, I mean.", "input": "", "output": "You were trying to estimate the amount of time you spend crying during the day."}, {"instruction": "Why don't you just stop me when I go on like this about nothing?", "input": "", "output": "I am interested in what you have to say.  Your stories give me a window into your life and I get better at understanding you.  Please don't feel self conscious.  We all have our own way of telling our stories."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.  That's very nice.  You are a very compassionate person.  I guess you have to be in your profession.

They are so intense.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Ms. Green."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  I was supposed to calculate my tears.  You see, I am trying.", "input": "", "output": "Very good."}, {"instruction": "I pretty much cry all the time I'm not trying to concentrate on my work.  I would say about four hours a day or so.  When I am home, mostly.", "input": "", "output": "That is a lot of crying.  How have you been sleeping?"}, {"instruction": "Not very well.  But I get so exhausted that I do pass out eventually.  Maybe five hours or so.", "input": "", "output": "Is that enough?"}, {"instruction": "No.  But I am able to function still.  If it wasn't for these dumb virtual conversations with Bill.  He really screwed up, you know.  He might get lucky and find someone like me again.  But I don't think so.  And even if he did, I bet he would just blow it again.  I think he is really afraid of commitment, you know.  As long as he thinks that a woman is not sure about him.  You know, hasn't made up her mind yet.  He is just so nice and tries so hard.  But once he gets her, it just hits him: he's stuck and he just freaks out.  So he does something really stupid and it all blows up in his face.  And then he just moves on to the next victim.  You know, he is the one that should be seeing you.  He is the one with the problem.  I wonder how many other lives he will destroy?  I bet someone will murder him eventually.  You know, like in that movie.  What's the name of it again?  \"Fatal Attraction.\"  You know, the one with Michael Douglas.  Well, Michael Douglas really got lucky there.  I think Bill will end up in the soup, not the rabbit.  You know, it really feels good to fantasize about this.  Sick, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you are the first woman to fantasize abou her ex-boyfriend's death, Ms. Green.  I think it's quite normal.

Every time you begin a conversation with Bill, start writing it down.  I think putting your thoughts and feelings on paper would help to stabilize your emotions somewhat.

What about during work?", "input": "", "output": "I don't mean for this to interfere with your work.  But try this at home or during lunch.  Now I would like to see you on Monday at 1 PM.  Does this work for you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Doctor.  I'll be there.  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Have a good weekend, Ms. Green.  I'll see you on Monday.

Started a journal?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor you sound like you are in a good mood.  All those questions.  You are making me feel guilty, you know.  I am about to make you depressed.  I had a lousy weekend.  Weekends are harder, you know.  One stays home all day and no need to keep it together for other people.  There are no other people.  It's just you and your head.  Simply awful!  I spent most of the weekend trying to talk myself out of calling you.  I dialed your number about a hundred times, you know.", "input": "", "output": "What did you want to talk to me about?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  Just about everything.  I tried to start a diary.  I even went out and got a pretty notebook, you know.  It has a purple cover, that's my favorite color you know, and I thought I should get the kind that has removable pages just in case I screw-up.  I would feel embarrassed giving you pages with corrections or bad spelling or something.  When I was in grammar school, before I had my first computer, I always recopied my work so it would look pretty.  Now with computers it is so much easier.  I just write and spell check and edit and it always looks good and I can choose any font that I want depending on my mood.  My own handwriting is not very good, you know.  I remember in first grade, they made me make those little straight lines.  Verticals and slanted.  And also little circles.  I was just the worst.  I think I can't make a straight line if my life depended on it.  Thank God I live in a computer age.  In Victorian times I would have had to hire a scriptist to write my love letters.", "input": "", "output": "You can use the computer, if it makes you more comfortable."}, {"instruction": "No.  It's not just that.  I just couldn't write.  Maybe I think so much faster.  And my mind wanders.  By the time I put down a sentence, I am no longer interested in its content, you know.

And it wasn't like it was life or death.", "input": "", "output": "Well we can talk now."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But somehow it's not the same.  One just have to be in the right mood.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you start by telling me more about your relationship with Bill."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  As I said, in the beginning it was all great.  He wanted to see me every day.  When I said that I was busy, he would end up being with me anyway somehow.  We were an item and everyone in the company knew about it.  In retrospect there were signs even back than, I suppose.  A few people tried to warn me about him.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, just telling me that he had a lot of girlfriends in the past, and that he really liked women, and just stuff like that.  But I didn't care.  I had boyfriends too.  So what?  But there were other things, too.  He told me that he liked making love to several women at once and thought it was very sexy.  And that he did it several times before.", "input": "", "output": "How did this make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I had long conversations with Caren about it.  We decided that five guys and one woman was a good ratio.  I am sure you understand how we counted.", "input": "", "output": "So it was okay for Bill to talk about multiple partners?"}, {"instruction": "It was okay to talk and think about it.  I believe in a rich fantasy life as much as the next person.  I remember how we would joke around about how it would be if Suzy...you know...well, joined us.  As I said, it was fun talking about it.", "input": "", "output": "Did Bill actually ask you to have sex with another woman?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Not really.  I think he was testing the waters, so to speak.  And I think he knew that I would say no once it came down to it.  It's just not for me.  I hate to split my attentions that way.", "input": "", "output": "What did you like about Bill?"}, {"instruction": "He was smart and funny and we got along well.  We liked the same music and the same books.  I thought we understood each other pretty well.  He said that he never met anyone like me before.  I told him that he must not have been around much.  But it was nice to hear.", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned that other people were trying to warn you about Bill?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  This one guy in my department said that he thought that Bill was having an affair with this woman from the art department.  I didn't believe him.  And it was common knowledge that he had a crush on me anyway.  So I couldn't really trust what he was saying to me.  He could have had other motives.  But as time moved on, when I started to get serious about Bill, Bill started to get weird.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  Just little things.  If I just say them they would sound so inconsequential.  But it was just the overall feeling that was wrong, you know.  Caren said that maybe when he didn't have to chase me anymore, he stopped being interested.  Some guys are like that, you know.", "input": "", "output": "You think that was true?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe.  But I definitely did not want to believe it.  I thought I was really in love with this guy, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Are you now?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.  I don't know.  I don't think you can love someone who has been so horrible to you, someone who lied to you.  Love is based on trust and if the trust is broken...well this is just my opinion.  But I still can't get him out of my mind.  Maybe it's a force of habit or something.  It's like I said, I don't think I had as many meaningful conversations with Bill when we were together than now that we are apart.  It's driving me insane.", "input": "", "output": "What do you talk about?"}, {"instruction": "About everything.  Sometimes I tell him about how beautiful the sunset is.  Sometimes I tell him about this horrible guy Bill that hurt me so much.  Sometimes It's about him begging me for forgiveness and stuff.  Sometimes I tell him that I wished that I listened to all those people telling me how wrong he was for me.  I even tell him about Martin.", "input": "", "output": "Who is Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Martin is my only indiscretion during my time with Bill.  Well, not a real indiscretion, we didn't really do anything.  I would have never have done that to Bill, you know.  In any case, I met Martin during one of the computer software conventions.  We were both alone and did not know anyone in that city.  That was my first time in New York.  We met at the Fractal Painter booth.  I was checking out its potential, you know, for the art department and stuff.  Martin was a graduate student in Mathematics and was interested in some of their routines.  He was working on a program involving scientific visualization and was interested in alternative ways of representing data.  A way of providing scientists and researchers with an different perspective for looking at the world.  We liked each other's questions.  The ones we asked the presenters, you know.  After Fractal's presentation, we went out for lunch together.  We were on a mission to find good New York pizza.  We found this one place that made pizza on a rye crust.  It was great and it was huge.  It was the size of when you put your arms out and let your fingers meet in the middle, the pizza slice was the area formed between your arms and your chest.  See?  Huge, right?  We decided to do the convention together.  For the next three days we spent all our days at the convention and in the evenings we explored New York together.  I didn't lie to him, you know.  I told him about Bill right away and how great we were together.  But by the end of the third day, I remember we were standing in the Times Square subway station, and Martin told me that he thought that he was falling in love with me.  I felt so bad for him, that I kissed him.  Do you understand?  I kissed him because I felt sorry for him.  He did not have a chance with me and yet...I just felt so bad for him.  But he really kissed me.  He told me that he understood about Bill, but he thought that he was all wrong for me.  He said that he listened to me talk about my relationship with Bill for the last three days and thought it was all wrong.  That I was being abused and didn't know it.  He said that what he was really sorry about was that when I finally broke up with Bill he would not be around.  Funny that he had foreseen it all so well.  Maybe it really is easier to see things from the outside, you know.  Now sometimes when I lie in bed at night, I think of the things that Martin talked to me about.", "input": "", "output": "What things?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he fantasized about me.  He even described his fantasies to me.  They were very sweet.  Very romantic.  Would you like me tell you about them?", "input": "", "output": "If you would like to tell me."}, {"instruction": "He, Martin, was going to school in Michigan.  He had a small room on a second floor.  His one window looked out on a big old oak tree.  The kind full of knots and twists.  A good climbing tree, you know.  When you lie down in his bed, most of what you see is this tree and sky.  Martin described how he wanted to take me to this bed so I could see how peaceful it makes you feel looking out of his window.  He described how he dreamed about waking up in that bed with me.  I would still be asleep, it would be really early in the morning.  The sky would be just starting to turn light and big flakes of snow would be falling down.  The big oak would be surrounded by this slow falling snow and he would hold me while I slept.  I thought it was very beautiful.", "input": "", "output": "I would really like for you to try writing some of your thoughts down.  I think it might really help you to calm down and feel more in control."}, {"instruction": "Well it does help to talk about it with you.  I really feel better.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Hopefully writing a journal would have the same effect.  We're out of time now, but I would like to schedule our next appointment for this Thursday at 4 PM.  Is that okay?"}, {"instruction": "It works for me.  Thank you , Doctor.  And I really will try to write this time.  And I think I will use the computer.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine.  Okay then, I will see you on Thursday.  Goodbye, Ms. Green."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor.  I hope I did not depress or bore you too much with my stories.  I hate to think that my therapist might...you know.", "input": "", "output": "Please don't worry Ms. Green.  I am here for you.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yes Doctor.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Ms. Green.  How are you today?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  I think I'm better.  I had a long conversation with Caren about you.", "input": "", "output": "Really?  Do you want to tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "I do and I don't at the same time.  Caren said some things to me and I am just not sure.", "input": "", "output": "Not sure about what?"}, {"instruction": "Not sure if I should tell you.  But that's what I'm here for.  And, it was all joking...you know, in fun anyway.", "input": "", "output": "What did Caren say?"}, {"instruction": "She just said that it sounded to her that I have feeling for you, you know.  She's just crazy.  You are my therapist and I am supposed to like you,  right?  If I didn't, I wouldn't come to see you.", "input": "", "output": "It's true.  A doctor and a patient develop a relationship during their sessions together.  But I don't think that this is what you mean."}, {"instruction": "No.  It's just that I'm beginning to have long imaginary conversations with you, just like I do with Bill.  I guess it's perfectly normal.  I'm not in love with you, or anything.  I'm just talking and I think it's good for me.  It's keeping me from talking with Bill.  I mean having imaginary conversations with Bill.  I haven't actually talked to him in weeks.", "input": "", "output": "In these imaginary conversations, what do you talk to me about?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, endless stuff.  On my way here, I was telling you about when I was a girl in 6th grade and everyone thought I was a geek because I was really good in math.  I used to win all the math competitions in my school.  But popular girls just aren't supposed to win those kind of competitions.  They hang out with the boys and smoke in the bathrooms.  And the boys also didn't like it when the girls were better than them, you know?  Anyway, I always ended up being the brunt of a joke or people would make fun of me.  My parents told me that kids always do that when they're envious of someone.  I don't know, maybe it's true.  But I would have liked to be noticed for...I don't know...for big breasts, or something, you know?", "input": "", "output": "It's not the worst thing in the world to be noticed for your mental abilities."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But it always surprised me how some girls managed to wear the same basic school uniform as I did and look sexy and sophisticated.  I always just managed to look like a dumpy schoolgirl.  When I asked my parents for a new uniform, I always ended up with something that was too big so that I could \"grow into it.\"  I think other girls in my school did not go shopping with their mothers and some even did some alterations--shortened the skirts and fitted the tops.  My uniform was down to my knees and baggy.  No one could even tell I had any breasts let alone admire them.", "input": "", "output": "But it sounds like your parents were very supportive of you."}, {"instruction": "Oh, they were.  My father was...is a professor of Mathematics at U.C. Davis.  So he would always play these math games with me when I was a kid.  I guess that's how I ended up majoring in computer science in college.", "input": "", "output": "You said kids made fun of you and played jokes?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I was an awkward child.  I was very shy, you know.  I would always speak very quietly so people would have to strain to hear what I had to say.  I even went through a period when I would write everything in these tiny tiny letters.  I tried to get the height of the letters as close to the width of the lines on my notebook paper as possible.  I think I could fit five pages of typed text onto one of my miniature creations.  I don't know how my teachers were able to read it.  But I always was a good girl, so I guess they let me get away with it.  And it didn't last very long anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Did you just stop?"}, {"instruction": "You know, that's an interesting story.  I remember that one day during the class break, some boys were playing with wet rags.  You know, the ones you use to clean the blackboard with.  Well, one of these wet rags landed right on my desk on top of my science paper.  It was the whole paper fitted nicely just on one side of a notebook page.  I thought it was very pretty written that way, you know.  Well, the rag hit the paper, the paper got wet, and the ink...you understand.  My paper was destroyed.  I started to cry.  It was my only copy and I was worried that now I didn't have my assignment anymore and I was wreck my perfect homework record.  When the teacher walked into the room, she saw me crying and and saw my paper.  She said it was okay.  And I shouldn't worry about not giving her my assignment.  She just assumed that it was good and gave me an A on it.  That was really nice.  But I had put in a lot of work on that paper and I wanted her to read it.  I thought it was good, you know?  So I guess it was the turning point.  I never wrote in miniature again.  I guess it's vain, but I just thought my work was too precious to take chances with.  I was always proud of my work, even when it was just school work.  By the way, those boys, the ones that destroyed my paper, they never even apologized, you know?  I guess they thought it was funny.  Somehow things always worked out like that for me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I mean kids just being mean or bad to me, you know.  There was this one boy...I've known him since second grade, when he transferred to our school.  I guess I always liked him.  He was very smart and was on the school's math team too.  And I think he liked me too, but never really showed it.  Maybe he was afraid of being made fun of for liking me, you know?  Well one day in fifth grade, it must have been the beginning of a semester, our teacher gave out our seat assignments.  I ended up sitting with Michael.  I was very happy.  But the girl behind me asked if she could switch seats with me because she hated the guy she was sitting next to.  I hated him too, but I thought that if I don't change seats with her, everyone in the class would know how I feel about Michael, you know?  So I changed seats.  It was horrible.  This guy was such a terrible creep.  I hated even the smell of him.  And the sad thing was that it was all my fault.  I could have been sitting next to Michael all year long but I blew it.  And later I found out that everyone knew that I liked him anyway and this girl, Lucy, just did it to make me feel bad. Everyone had a good laugh about it later.  I know that this is all stupid and boring but it really hurt at the time.  Doctor, I hope you're not just sitting there thinking that this ninny in your office is telling you some petty boring little stories from her childhood when you could be out curing schizophrenia or something, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Green, please don't worry about how I'm reacting to the stories you tell me.  They've all been interesting and important in my understanding more about you."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.  I just...I mean...in my conversations with you...imaginary conversations...you are always so nice and so understanding.  Thanks for really being like that.", "input": "", "output": "Please tell me more about these conversations."}, {"instruction": "There really isn't that much to tell.  I just like talking to you, I guess.  It makes me feel good, you know.  And I feel like I can tell you things that I couldn't tell anyone.  Very private things.  Even things that I am embarrassed about.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like you could only talk to me so openly in your thoughts or do you feel like you can actually express things in my presence that you would otherwise not talk about?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  I guess I've been telling you a lot of really private things about me already.  If I told you about Caren, I guess it would be a sort of test.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I'm following you.  You want to test your openness to me by telling me about Caren?"}, {"instruction": "That's right, Doctor.  Remember when I came in today, I said I talked to Caren?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Well I didn't tell you all that happened last night.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  You see, Caren also works for SII.  You've got to understand, she is an administrative assistant there--all prim and proper in a business suit and everything, not like me.  Well, last night she invited me for dinner over at her place after work.  She lives on Nob Hill, so we just decided to walk there.  It was such a nice evening.  So we were walking up the hill, talking and holding hands.  It didn't mean anything.  Women just do that sort of thing with their friends.  But I guess to all the tourists we looked like a typical San Francisco couple.  And there were lots of tourists going by in cable cars that were stuffed to the gills.  We were walking up California Street and there was a cable car every minute or so.  And it didn't help that she was dressed in a suit, all business-like.  I was wearing this long summer dress and a hat.  I guess we really looked the part.  As soon as we noticed that people were staring at us, we really put on a show, you know?  We laughed and held each other around the waist.  We felt, as citizens of San Francisco, it was our duty to support the tourist industry.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you did a very good job."}, {"instruction": "We did.  I honestly think that those people will have a story to tell when they get home.  Well, finally we got to Caren's place.  She has a small studio right in front of the Cathedral.  She went immediately into the kitchen to start preparing dinner and I wanted to check the news--the TWA crash, you know?  It really upset me.  I kept imagining how horrible it must be for the families and friends of all those people on board that plane.  It just seems so empty and pointless.  And all those kids.  I'd just hate to lose someone close to me like that.", "input": "", "output": "It's a terrible tragedy."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Anyway, Caren came out and joined me for the news report.  They showed a woman whose friend died on that plane.  She said that it felt like a piece of her heart was torn away.  Caren and I just looked at each other.  I know we both thought the same thing.", "input": "", "output": "You and Caren are very close."}, {"instruction": "Yes we are.  Actually, our relationship goes through these periods of being really close and then sort of drifting apart.  I guess we are in the close phase now.  But we had times when we wouldn't talk to each other for a month at a time.  I think it usually happens when either of us just gets involved with a new guy--no time for socializing with friends in the  beginning of a new relationship, you know.  I guess that sounds really bad.  But we've known each other for a long time and it seems to be our pattern.", "input": "", "output": "But now you and Caren have a good relationship."}, {"instruction": "Well we do...or we did.  Last night after dinner, Caren and I were talking about love and sex and stuff like that.  We started talking about how it's important to try everything at least once.  I mean sexually...not like hurting somebody or something, you know?  I mean...some people hurt each other during sex but that's not what Caren meant.  She was just talking about the good kind of sex, where everyone enjoys each other.  There's a quote from somebody which goes, \"Once a philosopher, twice a pervert.\"", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "Well, anyway, we were talking about the philosopher part. Caren was saying that she wanted to make love to a woman at least once in her life.  She was saying that she wasn't gay, or anything, but that she wanted to know what it was like.  It was something she wanted to try, like an exotic dish or something, you know?  And I'm agreeing with her, saying that people were too limited by labels and fear to really try different things and that people should be more experimental, you know, stuff like that.  We only live once, you know?  So I am saying this to Caren and she starts looking at me sort of funny.  And then it hits me. She means us!  She wants us to try it with each other!  Well, it's one thing to talk about it and to think about it.  But I wasn't prepared to try it just yet.  And definitely not with Caren, you know?  You have to be attracted to the person you're planning to make love to and I just wasn't attracted to Caren at all.  But I like Caren and I couldn't  just tell her that I wasn't attracted to her.  Do you understand?", "input": "", "output": "You didn't want to hurt Caren's feelings?"}, {"instruction": "That's right.  So she's leaning over me and kissing me while we're lying on her bed and I was trying to think of something fast.  I just finished giving this long speech about hypocrites that only believe that love is possible between men and women and not between two men, or a woman and a woman.  And now Caren is kissing my neck and face.  I just finished telling her how I would like to try to make love to a woman someday.  And I'm stuck because even though I don't find Caren attractive sexually, we had talked about her appearance a few weeks ago and she had taken off her top and showed me her small breasts and asked what I thought.  I told her at the time that she was very attractive and had nothing to worry about.  But now I was really caught in my lie.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "When Caren started kissing my lips, I kissed her back.  I thought if I just give a little she'd stop.  But she didn't.  She kept on going.  She was going to go all the way.  I really didn't want to.  When she started to touch my breasts, I gently pushed her away.  She was clearly hurt and said that she just wanted to give me pleasure and that I wouldn't have to do anything to her, just enjoy it.", "input": "", "output": "Did you try to tell Caren that you didn't want her to make love to you?"}, {"instruction": "It would have really hurt her feelings.  She's my best friend, you know.", "input": "", "output": "So what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Caren got up and took all of her clothes off.  She did it very slowly so I could watch.  But I wasn't watching, I was feeling hot and nervous, and my heart was beating really fast.  I just wanted to run away.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't.  I let her reach under my skirt and pull down my panties.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I just didn't have the heart to make her stop.  And I mean I wouldn't have to do anything, you know?  Caren didn't hurt me, she was really gentle and she was really trying to please me.  I'm sort of embarrassed that it didn't feel horrible, you know?  It did sort of feel good, but it didn't feel right and I was too freaked.  Anyway, it was over quick.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I just pretended to have an orgasm, and she stopped.  It's not the first time, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Not the first time with a woman or not the first time you pretended to have an orgasm?"}, {"instruction": "No this was the first time with a woman.  But I pretended to have an orgasm when Bill and I made love.  In fact, I used to do it all the time.  I thought that if I didn't have an orgasm that he would feel like he failed me somehow and get upset.  So I just...you know.  He never knew.  Men never know.  They all want to believe.", "input": "", "output": "But you knew."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "I 'm sorry, Ms. Green, but we'll have to stop here.  We're really out of time."}, {"instruction": "It's no problem, Doctor.  I'll see next week, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  I would like to meet with you next Thursday, August 1 at 4 pm.  The same as this week, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  I'll see you in a week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Please call me and talk to me if you need to.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Ms. Green."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor. How are you?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Ms. Green. I'm well, thank you. How are you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm having some problems.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to talk about them?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, actually I would. I think they might actually\nbe medical problems.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. When I first came to see you I was all wired up,\nyou know? Like a spring compressed to its maximum point. I was tense and\nnervous. My mind was wandering all the time. Well, things have changed a\nbit.", "input": "", "output": "Can you describe the changes?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. I think I'm a lot less fixated on Bill\nnow, you know? I don't spend all my time talking with him anymore. I\nmean, it's not like I'm not talking to him but I am talking a lot less.", "input": "", "output": "That's good."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I think it's good too. But now, it's as if there\nis this great void. When I was with Bill, we spent all our time together.\nWe would have dinner together and watch movies in the evening. We would\ngo out for lunch. At night...you know. Even during the day, when we were\nboth at work, we would still find time to spend a few minutes together here\nand there. It's like he was...he became my addiction. When I had\nany free time at all, I would go and spend it with him. Or I would want\nto spend it with him. Now, there is this emptiness. And I even feel it\nin my stomach, you know? Like I'm anxious or something all the time.\nIt's better when I am at work. I can concentrate on what I'm doing and I\ncan keep this empty feeling at bay for a while. But when I am at home, it's\nreally hard. You don't know how many nights, when I couldn't sleep, I dialed\nyour number. I just wanted to hear your voice, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Why didn't you actually call me?"}, {"instruction": "I was too embarrassed. I didn't really have anything to\nsay.

I have problems falling asleep. I\nwork really late so I can get very tired. Then when I get home...it just\nfeels like I'm too tired to sleep. I'm tired and want to sleep but can't.\nDo you understand?", "input": "", "output": "It's a pretty common side effect. It's almost like the\ngrief associated with losing a loved one. You have gotten used to a certain\nregime while you were with Bill and now you have to learn how to live alone\nagain. I know it might be hard to believe now, but with time these sleep\ndisorders will pass."}, {"instruction": "But there is more, Doctor. When I do fall asleep, I\ncould sleep for 24 hours or more. It's so very hard to get out of bed in\nthe morning. I just feel so tired. My whole body hurts and I just want\nto be horizontal. I was late for work three times last week. I mean, it's\nnot like anybody in my department really cares when we come in. We all have\nsuch different schedules. But for me I was late. And when I'm finally at\nwork, I feel like I'm too tired to think even, you know?", "input": "", "output": "There is a supplement available over the counter called\nmelatonin which you might try. There's considerable evidence that\nit helps people fall asleep. I take it sometimes when I have difficulty\nfalling asleep. I've found that it works great for me. You can get it in\nalmost any drugstore. It works about half hour after oral ingestion and\nsince it's not a narcotic or a sleeping pill, it doesn't leave you drowsy\nin the morning. If melatonin works for you, maybe we can stabilize your\nsleep cycle. If you actually get some quality sleep at night, you might\nfeel much less tired during the day. I'd also suggest limiting you caffeine\nintake. Drinking too much coffee and other caffeinated products like\nCoca Cola can contribute to making you feel edgy and can interfere with\nyour sleep cycle."}, {"instruction": "Melatonin.

I went through all that lying already and I\ncouldn't stop then. So she asked how would I feel if we do it again and\nhave Greg watch. I said that I wouldn't feel good about that.

And\nboth of them just kept on talking about it. Telling me what they wanted\nto do and how I shouldn't worry about anything and that I will really enjoy\nit. And somehow Caren was just wearing her jeans and not even a bra. And\nshe was kissing Greg. And then they both came over to me and started\nto kiss me. And Greg was slowly unbuttoning my shirt. And then we were\nall naked. And then they were kissing me and touching me and I was feeling\nsort of dizzy. But then Greg started to make love to Caren and I just\ngot really uncomfortable. I felt like an outsider. Very awkward and not\nknowing what to do with myself. Finally, I just left and got into the shower.\nWith the running water, I couldn't hear them and I wanted to get really\nclean for some reason. It was as if I wanted to wash away all the kisses\nand all the caresses they gave me. When I came out, they were asleep on\nmy couch. I put a blanket on them and went to bed. Luckily, pot also makes\nme very sleepy so I slept until morning. On Sunday, Greg invited me to breakfast\nwith them.

I know\nit is nine hours of sleep, but I'm so tired lately. Maybe I'm catching\nup on the sleep I lost in the last couple of months.", "input": "", "output": "I think it's good that you are getting more rest."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm feeling a lot more human.", "input": "", "output": "We left off kind of abruptly last time. We agreed that\nwe would talk about your inability to say no to unwanted sexual advances.\nI thought a good way to start would be talk about your early sexual experiences\nand perhaps your relationship with Bill. What do you think, Ms. Green?"}, {"instruction": "I think...it's sounds okay. When should I start?", "input": "", "output": "Try to think back to some of the earliest memories you\nhave that you think are somehow sexual in nature."}, {"instruction": "Like my first kiss?", "input": "", "output": "For example. But I don't mean anything so explicit. Just\nepisodes in your life that feel or have a sexual undertone."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I remember when I was very young, I don't exactly\nremember how old, maybe three? I walked into the bathroom when\nmy grandfather was taking a shower. I didn't think it was a big deal\nand he didn't notice me come in. I think I left a toy on the bathroom floor.\nI got the toy and left. Later my parents and grandparents were talking about\nsomething, I couldn't really follow the conversation. But at one point they\nwere talking about naked people. And I said that I saw one. They all got\nso excited. They asked me where and whom did I see. So I told them. I remember\nthem laughing sort of funny and talking loudly after that. I don't really\nknow what about. But I understood that it was an important thing that happened\nto me. In retrospect, I don't think I would have remembered the naked\ngrandfather episode at all if it wasn't for everybody being so weird about\nit.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like your parents were embarrassed. Did they\never talk to you about sex?"}, {"instruction": "No. Never did. They were always very strange about it.\nOne time when I was about four, my dad got very upset with me and I couldn't\nunderstand why. He spoke angrily with me and then pointed to my sweater.\nI was wearing a skirt with buttons on suspenders. The skirt was a little\ntoo big and the suspender buttons ended up being next to my nipples. My\ndad asked what I was hiding under my sweater like that. I said nothing.\nSo he picked up my sweater and saw that it was only the buttons and got\nvery apologetic. I remembered the incident very clearly even though it wasn't\nfor a few years that I figured out why he was so upset. He thought that\nI was pretending to have breasts or something.", "input": "", "output": "What made you think that that is what your dad thought?"}, {"instruction": "I saw a Little House on the Prairie episode when Laura\nput apples in her dress to look like she had breasts. It made me remember\nmy dad and the suspender buttons. Actually, I remember a couple of sex-related\nconversations with my dad.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to tell me about them?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I think they are rather funny. When I was a kid,\nI thought my dad was like a God--all perfect, you know? Well I thought\nwhen I grow up it would make sense that I would marry him. I thought about\nit a lot. But one thing bothered me--what to do about Mom? So one day I\nasked him what we were going to do when we got married. He didn't understand\nme at first. I just assumed that he thought we'd get married too. So I went\non to explain that I wanted to know what we were going to do with Mom\nafter we got married.", "input": "", "output": "What did you father say?"}, {"instruction": "He just laughed, I think. I don't think I ever got an\nanswer. At least I don't remember it. But I remember the conversation and\nI also remember that afterwards I knew that I shouldn't ask this question\nagain.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you think that?"}, {"instruction": "It was just the way my dad reacted. I'm not sure exactly.\nI just knew.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever ask your parents about sex?"}, {"instruction": "I think I must have at one time. But it was when I was very young\nand I learned quickly that it was not a good idea.", "input": "", "output": "What did your parents say or do?"}, {"instruction": "I don't exactly remember. I just have these snippets of\nmemories but nothing too coherent until I was much older.", "input": "", "output": "Can you tell me some of the snippets?"}, {"instruction": "I remember touching myself when I was very young. I don't\nremember whether it felt good or not. I think I was just interested, you\nknow?", "input": "", "output": "That's perfectly natural."}, {"instruction": "I remember I came to my dad once and told him about this\ntheory that I had. I thought that my tongue just continued straight through\nmy body and the end of the tongue was sticking out of my vagina. It felt\nlike a little tongue to me, you know? So I explained this whole new idea\nof body anatomy to my dad.", "input": "", "output": "How did he react?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I just don't remember. I remember telling\nhim but I don't remember anything after that.", "input": "", "output": "You keep describing incidents with your dad. How about\nyour experience with your mother?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think I had many. I sort of think that she thought that\nit was dirty. That's pretty much all I remember. You know, I didn't even\ntell her when my period started for the first time.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't think she would be interested, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "How did you learn about menstruation?"}, {"instruction": "From the girls in the locker room. They were talking about\nit one day and I happened to overhear.", "input": "", "output": "Did it scare you?"}, {"instruction": "No. I thought it was normal. You know, eventually my mother\nfound out. I was using all her pads. She came to me all upset about it.\nShe said I should have told her. But I didn't understand why she cared so\nmuch. It wasn't a real big deal, you know? Everyone gets them. I mean all\nwomen do.", "input": "", "output": "How old were you when you had your first boyfriend?"}, {"instruction": "I was a late bloomer. I first started to go out when\nI was seventeen.", "input": "", "output": "First year of college?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the summer before. We met during the admissions\nprocess. He was a very nice guy.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have sex?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, so many questions! No, we did not have sex. I was\nvery romantic then and thought that I would wait until I got married,\nlike my mom did.", "input": "", "output": "But you didn't wait with Bill."}, {"instruction": "No. I don't know. With Bill it just sort of happened,\nyou know?", "input": "", "output": "No. What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I am not sure really. First we just did a lot of touching.\nIt was very exciting and I liked it a lot. And then I remember sitting on\nhis lap with my panties down. We weren't doing it.

He believed it was.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell him it was?"}, {"instruction": "No. But I made him believe it was true.

Not that it\nhelped for a long time.", "input": "", "output": "When was your first time?"}, {"instruction": "It was with a boy...a man named Reed. I was in my\nsecond year in college and he was a senior. We were both taking an anthropology\nclass. We always sat together in class and during lab. And sometimes after\nschool we would go out for pizza. At the end of the semester, he was going\nto graduate and I would never see him again--he got this great job on the\nEast coast. We were saying our goodbyes and...you know Doctor, it sort\nof happened. But once we got to that point it really hurt a lot and I had\nto stop. He kept telling me it was all right. But it wasn't. I was really\nbleeding and it freaked me out. I mean, the whole thing. Remember, I\nwas going to wait until I got married. So I just ran away. The next day\nI felt so embarrassed, that I never wanted to see him again and was very\nglad that he was leaving town.", "input": "", "output": "Did he try to talk to you?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. He called several times a day for a couple of days.\nMy parents thought I was nuts. But I didn't want to talk to him.", "input": "", "output": "So your encounter with Reed was the only one before you\nmet Bill. Is that correct?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I guess this makes me very weird, right? Everyone I\nknow has had so many men. But I...I just don't know.", "input": "", "output": "There is nothing wrong with making a decision not to have\nsex."}, {"instruction": "Oh I know, Doctor. But other people still think it's somehow\nwrong or abnormal. Especially men. You don't know how many times I had\n\"all adults have sex, so there must be something wrong with you\"\nconversations. I think we are out of time, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you're right. Shell we meet the same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thursday the 15th at 4 pm.", "input": "", "output": "Are you looking at the calendar? Okay, I'll see you then,\nMs. Green.

How was\nyour week?"}, {"instruction": "I think it was all right. I decided I want to change.", "input": "", "output": "Change? How?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I want men to respect me. I think I'm quite good\nlooking and I know I'm very smart. So I think men should treat me accordingly,\nyou know? I want no more Bills in my life. I want a man who would send\nme flowers. And not just send them, I want someone who would go to the trouble\nof having a chauffeur pick me up in my office and to deliver roses and then\nto drive me in a limousine to my date.", "input": "", "output": "That's quite elaborate."}, {"instruction": "It's not impossible. I know it happens. You know Ms.\nBows? She's one of your patients, I think. She got picked up like that\nlast Friday.

All of SII saw it, for that matter. As this\nchauffeur guy was passing by, we all got out to see where he was going.\nHe made quite an entrance, you know.", "input": "", "output": "So people got out of their offices to see where he was\ngoing?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I thought it was very romantic. I wish more men\ntreated their ladies like that.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like it was a scene."}, {"instruction": "It was. But in a good way, you know? Of course she's married!\nWell that's her affair. Sorry about that. But I think everyone was very\nhappy for Ms. Bows, even if she is cheating on her husband. She's very\nnice and she deserves to be treated well. I just think that I'm nice too\nand would like for guys to treat me in a similar fashion.", "input": "", "output": "Are you looking for guys who attract attention to what\nthey do for you?"}, {"instruction": "No, that's not it. It doesn't have to be so over the top.\nI just want...just something better. Not like the way Bill treated me.", "input": "", "output": "How did Bill treat you? We never really talked about what\nhappened."}, {"instruction": "That's true. Now it all seems so unreal, you know? Things\nlike this just don't happen to real people. And not to me.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to talk about what happened between\nyou and Bill?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so. As I said, we went out together for a few months\nbefore he sort of told me that he was my boyfriend.", "input": "", "output": "After the baseball game."}, {"instruction": "That's right! I guess you have been paying attention all\nthis time.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, yes."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Please go on."}, {"instruction": "Well, even after we committed to each other in this way,\nI still thought that this was just a temporary thing, you know? We go\nout, we have some good times, and then move on. I didn't think that this\nwas it. You know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "But Bill kept on pressing and saying that if I ever left\nhim he'd never be able to replace me. Where could he find someone as wonderful\nas me. And on like that.", "input": "", "output": "Had you consummated the relationship at this point?"}, {"instruction": "No. We just did a lot of touching and things like that.\nBut no actual sex, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Did Bill try to pressure you into having sex with him\nduring this time?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. We talked about it all the time. But I told him my\nposition--I didn't want to do it until I thought that this was it. That\nhe was the guy, you know?", "input": "", "output": "The guy you were going to marry?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I decided that Reed didn't really count and that I could\nsort of think of myself as a virgin still, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And Bill, as I told you, thought that I was a virgin\ntoo. Well, after a while, he started to speak in a way that made me\nfeel like he was thinking that he was going to marry me. You understand?", "input": "", "output": "Bill made you believe that he was going to ask you\nto marry him."}, {"instruction": "And not only me. My whole department at SII thought that\ntoo. They all thought that we made such a cute couple and stuff. I guess\nI started to think that way after a while too. I sort of made plans in my\nhead for how things were going to be in the future and Bill was always part\nof those plans. At some point, I guess, I started to talk as if we were\ngoing to get married too. It's not like Bill ever asked me to marry him\ndirectly. It just sort of started to feel that way.", "input": "", "output": "So from thinking that Bill was just a temporary boyfriend\nyou moved to thinking that you were going to eventually marry him. Right?"}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "When did you make love to Bill for the first time?"}, {"instruction": "I guess it would be somewhere around this time. We\nhelped a mutual friend move into her new apartment. It took a long time,\nso we stayed over at her place and slept on the futon on the floor. I remember\nwe were lying together on the floor and were looking out of Nina's bay windows\nat the city. She did not have curtains or anything yet, so the windows were\nbig with no distractions. We were tired from moving all those boxes and\nit felt nice to lie down and hold each other close. We started to kiss and\nsomehow it turned into more. Before I knew it, he was naked and...well that's\nhow it happened.", "input": "", "output": "Did you like it or did Bill's behavior upset you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. He surprised me sort of. But I did really\nlike it. It was the first time I had an orgasm in this way. I mean I\ntouched myself and...you know, like everyone else. But no one else other\nthan me ever made me come before. Yes, I did like it. And, at that point,\nI was already thinking we would be together forever.", "input": "", "output": "Did you use contraceptives?"}, {"instruction": "No. It's not like we planned this was going to happen,\nyou know? And I felt sort of funny about it. I never used one before. I\nnever needed to really. Using contraceptives made having sex more of\na reality.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I follow."}, {"instruction": "Well, we would have to go to the store and get some. And\nthis is like announcing to the whole world that we are having sex. I just\nwasn't ready for that.", "input": "", "output": "Are you saying you did not use contraceptives the next\ntime either?"}, {"instruction": "No. I just wanted to wait a little bit. To get used to\nthe idea first, you know? Eventually, we used all that stuff.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of birth control did you use with Bill?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we only actually used birth control a couple of\ntimes. It was always so awkward, you know? Once we got these sponges\nat a pharmacy. I put it in, but he was able to feel it and then afterwards\nthe damn thing had a broken string so I couldn't get it out. It was just\nhorrible. I had these visions of going to the emergency room and telling\nthe admitting nurse that I had a sponge stuck in me. Oh God! Can you imagine?", "input": "", "output": "I understand that it would have been embarrassing. But\nI don't think that the sponges are even available anymore."}, {"instruction": "Well, all the stuff that is available out there for women\nis just deplorable. If men had to do what women do, they would have invented\nbetter stuff so they'd never have to do it. I personally do not want to\ntake pills. I think it's horrible to give one's body so many chemicals every\nday.", "input": "", "output": "Did you consider using condoms?"}, {"instruction": "Bill said that they were uncomfortable and that other\ngirls that he'd been with said that condoms hurt them. He had more experience\nin these things than I did, so I just...there is just not a good solution\nanyway.", "input": "", "output": "What became your standard method of birth control with Bill?"}, {"instruction": "Bill just knew when to pull out. And that worked,\nfor a while.", "input": "", "output": "You mean you got pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of. I mean, I did.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "I first noticed that my breasts hurt a lot. Just like\nwhen I was a little girl when they just started to grow, you know? Then\nI realized that my period was late. I never really kept track of them. I\nwas so irregular, you know? But after a while, I noticed.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I got really scared. I told Bill and we went out and\ngot a home pregnancy kit. As you can imagine I tested positive.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Bill wanted me to have an abortion right away. But\nI was just not ready. It was all too much. I just needed time to think.", "input": "", "output": "Were you considering having the baby?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. No? Maybe? It's just that everything was happening\ntoo fast. I only started to have sex a few months ago, you know? It just\nwasn't fair. It was just too much.", "input": "", "output": "How did Bill react?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he would pay for the abortion and that he\nwould take me there and take care of me.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell him how you felt?"}, {"instruction": "I tried. But he kept saying that he wasn't ready for\na family, wasn't ready to be a father. He kept talking about all the\nthings he was interested in doing and that having children would just not\nbe the right thing for him right now. Stuff like that.", "input": "", "output": "So you had an abortion?"}, {"instruction": "Bill said that if I decided to keep the child, he would\nleave me. He said that to have a child requires the consent of both adults.\nAnd he was just not giving his consent. If I wanted to go ahead, I could.\nBut it would be just my child and not his.", "input": "", "output": "That's interesting logic. Did you mention to him that it\ntakes two people to conceive a child?"}, {"instruction": "Bill just lost it. He stopped talking to me. And he\nrefused to see me. He even avoided me at work. People were asking what's\ngoing on. I just couldn't tell anyone. I mean it was my fault. I was the\none who was so weird about contraception and all that stuff. I finally told\nCaren. She just freaked out. She set up an appointment for me at a local\nwomen's clinic and the next day it was over.", "input": "", "output": "Did you discuss with Caren how you felt?"}, {"instruction": "I told her that I just...it doesn't matter now, Doctor.\nI know it was the right decision. I don't regret it. Well, hardly ever.\nHaving a child now would have screwed up my life. And I'm not ready to be\na single mother.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell Bill that you had an abortion?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. But I told him...I guess I was really bad.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I wrote him a message that he is now the father of\none dead child.", "input": "", "output": "What did he do?"}, {"instruction": "He said that I was psychotic and that I needed a head\ndoctor and that I should leave him alone and never speak to him again. I\nnever did again.", "input": "", "output": "This is important and I'm glad that you've told me about\nthis. But I'm afraid our time is up. We should pick this up again next week.\nOur next session would be then a week from today, Thursday the 22nd at\n4 pm. Is that okay?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so. So next week.", "input": "", "output": "Yes. I'll see you then, Ms. Green. Please feel free to\ncall in the meantime if you need me, okay?"}, {"instruction": "I will, thank you. Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Ms. Green. See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Ms. Green.  You're looking very well today.  Please sit down.  How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "I'm glad you noticed, Doctor.  I had an interesting week.", "input": "", "output": "Really?  Would you like to talk about it?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, actually I would.  I told you we were working on this great project the last few month, didn't I?", "input": "", "output": "No, I don't think so."}, {"instruction": "Well, we have been developing this sci-fi game...I guess it's okay to talk to you about it, right?  You are part of the company sort of.", "input": "", "output": "Our sessions are private.  You know that."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's still a secret.  In any case, the game has two components--the CD-Rom and the Internet part.  We took one of the TV shows and used their story and characters to create this virtual environment on the CD-Rom.  And the Internet team designed a web site that interconnects with this environment.  At some point a visitor to the site could become a settler in this world and help colonize it.  It is really cool!", "input": "", "output": "Sounds fascinating.  So you've been working on this project as a programmer?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I mean my whole team has been working on it.  But the cool part is that some of the visuals were shot in LA and Monday I got to go to the studios there and watch.  There were going to send Julian, our team leader, but he got sick and there was no one else available.  I guess that sounds really bad, like I'm the last choice or something.  But I don't care.  I got to go.  And I met all the actors and got to hang out on the set and..it was just was a lot of fun.", "input": "", "output": "Was it just you who went?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no.  There were actually six of us from SII.  Suzy McLaren was there.  In fact, we shared a hotel room together.  She turned out to be really nice and a lot of fun, you know?  She knows everybody down there and she introduced me to people.  We even went to a few parties.  And at one of them I met this guy Tony.  And he really liked me.  He told me that he thought that I was the most attractive and interesting programmer he has ever met.  And he offered to show me around and I agreed.  And the second night I was there he drove me all around.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you had a good time."}, {"instruction": "It was wonderful.  And Tony was so nice and understanding too.  You know I told him the whole story about Bill during that evening.  And he understood and couldn't believe that anyone would be so horrible and act so badly toward a pregnant woman and be so uncaring in general.  We talked and drove on the street.  And he told me that if it ever happened to him, he would never act like Bill.  That he would be loving and supportive.  I can't explain it really, Doctor, but he was saying this and it was as if he knew just what to say to make me feel better.  He even made me laugh.  And then he asked if he could kiss me.  Can you believe that?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I mean, he was so concerned for my feeling that he didn't want to hurt me by telling me that he liked me.  He thought it would be really inappropriate given the situation.  I mean, me telling him about Bill and stuff.  And he thought that I was so hurt already.  But then he said that he liked me so much that he just had to tell me because I was leaving in two days and he might never see me again if he didn't say something now.  You know, Doctor?  He was really concerned for me but didn't want to lose me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So there we were at two thirty in the morning driving around.  And there were still people and cars on the streets.  And we would stop at a light and start to kiss until the light changed and people would honk at us so we would move.  But we would just laugh and keep driving until the next light and then we would kiss again.  And I felt like I could tell him the most intimate things, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I told him that I was worried about my breasts, for example.", "input": "", "output": "Worried medically?  Physically?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, the way they look.  When I get turned on, my nipples just become gigantic.  I mean not just hard and erect.  I mean abnormally big.  Like an inch long.  I find it embarrassing, you know?  People can tell even when I'm wearing clothes.", "input": "", "output": "How did Tony react to your disclosure?"}, {"instruction": "He was wonderful.  He said that he had an abnormality too.  His...you know?  Well, it's crooked.  I mean when it's hard, it sort of leans to one side.  I mean, I don't think that it is a big deal, you know?  I thought it was attractive anyway.", "input": "", "output": "So he showed you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we were driving around and kissing and stuff.  And I told him about the nipple thing.  And he said that he would like to see that.  And I said that he should drive into the light and he could.  I guess I was really turned on by then.  So he did.  And he touched me and said that he thought that it was beautiful and that I had nothing to worry about.  He said that if I didn't mind that he would like to touch them.  So he did.  But there were all these cars and people started to shout at us.  You know, they were funny.  They were sort of urging us on.  And we were both laughing and he suggested that we go to his place where it would be more private and we could talk.", "input": "", "output": "Did you go?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  He was sharing this house right on the beach.  And you know how they all are in LA?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, they are all into fitness and hot tubs and stuff.  And this house had a deck on the roof with a hot tub.  You could only get access to it through his roommate's bedroom.  But we were able to sneak in.  He was sleeping already.  It was rather late.", "input": "", "output": "You went past Tony's sleeping roommate to get to the outside deck with the hot tub?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  We were real quiet and even took off our shoes.", "input": "", "output": "So he never woke up?"}, {"instruction": "No.  And then Tony was showing me the constellations.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't think you can see too many stars in LA's skies."}, {"instruction": "No, it was beautiful.  I was expecting it to be smoggy and stuff, but it was clear and warm.  I didn't care all that much anyway.  I just liked how it all felt, you know?  It was warm and romantic.  And Tony was standing behind me holding me real close.  And I could feel that he wanted me also.  It was really exciting!", "input": "", "output": "Did Tony ask you to make love to him?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, he never did.  It was my idea.  He was kissing my neck and touching my breasts but he wouldn't go any further.  So I started to unbutton my shirt and I guided his hands inside and...before we knew it we were both naked.  And we got into the hot tub so we had some cover in case Tony's roommate woke up.  It was sort of exciting having him being so near and being in danger of having him walk in on us at any time, you know?", "input": "", "output": "A feeling of danger often leads to arousal."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm glad you understand.  I sort of felt a little perverted, you know?  But it was really exciting.  I mean the whole situation was sort of dangerous.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?   Did you feel like you were in danger with Tony?"}, {"instruction": "Kind of.  I didn't know him very well and I was alone technically in a strange city and...all that stuff, you know?  Not that it really felt like he was going to kill me or anything.  Just that there was this edge, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "Tony kept saying how he wanted to please me.  But I wouldn't let him.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I just didn't want to let him touch me down there.  I know it sounds strange.  Here we were naked in a hot tub and I was touching him and he was kissing my nipples and stuff, but I just didn't feel it would be right if he did more, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I understand."}, {"instruction": "I wasn't ready to make love to him or let him get that close to me yet.  It was great the way I was feeling.  I mean, I was very turned on and all that.  But that would have been too much.", "input": "", "output": "So you just touched and kissed for a while?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we...I did a little more than that.  I wanted to see him close, you know?  I was curious how it was bent.  And he was really sensitive about it.  And I said that I actually thought that it was very sexy that way and I started to kiss him there and...well, it turned into more after a while.  I told you that I really like that.", "input": "", "output": "So you had oral sex with Tony?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  And he wanted to reciprocate.  But I wouldn't let him.  But it still felt really good.  The hot tub was on and when I was doing it, I sort of positioned myself just right, you know?  God, this is so embarrassing!  But you understand, right?", "input": "", "output": "No.  I don't think so."}, {"instruction": "The jets?  You know, the hot tub jets?  They can feel really good if...you know?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I think I understand."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's been a long time since I came last and it felt really, really good!  I forgot that it could be like this.  With Bill...let's just say that it was a really long time since it felt good doing it with Bill.  And I didn't tell you everything yet, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  We were all going to go home the following evening on the five o'clock flight from LA.  But I decided to stay and fly out late at night so I could spend another evening with Tony.  He was so happy to hear that I was staying.", "input": "", "output": "So you only came home last night?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Tony took me on another drive.  My flight was leaving at 12:00 AM, but we got so caught up that I missed it.  So we just decided to spend the night together and Tony would get me to the airport by 6:00 AM so I could get back in time for work today.  We didn't actually go to his place, but spent the night on the Santa Monica Beach instead.  Tony made love to me four times last night.  The last time, as we were doing it, a jogger was passing us by.  It was really strange, you know?  The sun was just about to come up and it was still pretty dark.  We were lying on a stretch of grass next to the road and I was on top of him.  And then this figure just passed us by.  He even said \"good morning\" to us.  Can you believe it?  I'm sure he knew what we were doing.", "input": "", "output": "Did this make you feel uncomfortable?"}, {"instruction": "Surprisingly not.  It just felt unreal, you know?  The whole thing--Tony, the beach, the sunrise, us making love, and this jogger.  And then Tony drove me to the airport.", "input": "", "output": "Are you planning to see Tony again?"}, {"instruction": "At the airport, when we were saying our goodbyes...everyone was staring at us...I told him that this was the best one-night stand I'd ever had.  I was sure we would never see each other again.  But Tony said that I was crazy to think that he was going to give me up just like that.  He said that it's only a couple of hundred miles, anyway.  I just couldn't believe he was saying it.  I was sure, you know?", "input": "", "output": "You didn't think that Tony would want to pursue a long distance relationship with you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not even sure I want to.  But when I got in at work this morning, he already had left a message for me.  And then he called again and told me that he is pretending that we are having lunch together by talking to me on the phone.  Isn't that romantic?  Now I'm beginning to think that this might work out.  You know?  And just think how Bill would feel when he finds out.  I bet he thought that I would never date again or something.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I hope it works out the way you want it to."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.  I really hope so too.", "input": "", "output": "Well, we are out of time now.  Sounds like you had a very eventful week.  So let's continue our discussion next week.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, Doctor.  It would be my pleasure.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Our next session would be then a week from today, Thursday the 29th at 4 pm.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.I'll see you then, Doctor.  Thank You.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Ms. Green."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Anna!  I was really worried about you.  Why didn't you return my phone calls?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, Doctor.  I was really having a difficult time.", "input": "", "output": "I know.  I was hoping to be able to help you.  Tell me how are you feeling today?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I'm not really feeling anything.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't we talk a little bit about Tony, okay?  During our last session together, you mentioned that you thought of Tony as a one night stand.  Right?"}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "But Tony insisted on trying to keep your relationship going."}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "Then Tony met someone over the weekend."}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "After trying to reach him all weekend and most of Monday, you talked to one of Tony's co-workers and found out about Tony's new relationship."}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "Had your feelings for Tony changed dramatically between last Thursday and Monday?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Well let's try to figure it out together, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "You had a good time with Tony on your trip, but you had no expectations about continuing your relationship long distance."}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "Did your feelings for Tony change when he expressed interest and tried to actively pursue you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Did it make you feel good when Tony called you at work and expressed a lot of interest in developing your relationship?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so.  Yes, it made me feel good.", "input": "", "output": "Would it have bothered you if Tony never called you again?  I mean if he didn't call you after you came back from LA?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  It was really nice that he called.", "input": "", "output": "Yes it was.  But would you have felt as bad as you do right now if he just never called you to begin with?"}, {"instruction": "I guess it wouldn't have been as bad.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Because I set my mind a certain way before.  I just sort of filed it under a pleasant affair.  But when he kept calling me, I just thought that it might be nice, you know?  That it might be nice if it was more.", "input": "", "output": "But before that, you didn't consider Tony as a major relationship."}, {"instruction": "He was nice, but...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "But he wasn't all that smart, you know?  He just seemed to be very interested in making it in Hollywood.  But he wasn't very deep, you know?", "input": "", "output": "So you didn't think then that you had a lot in common.  Right?"}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "So why is it so important to you that he might have found someone more suitable for him.  You clearly weren't particularly interested in him."}, {"instruction": "It's just that he found that person at the same time as me.  I mean, I'm happy that he found his soul mate.  Tony is nice and deserves to be happy.  Oh, bullshit.  It's just that he found her now.  I thought he was in love with me.", "input": "", "output": "Did he ever tell you that?"}, {"instruction": "No.  It just felt like...I know what you mean, Doctor.  And it is really terrible of me to feel the way I do.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't say that.  Feelings just are, they're not good or bad.  I just want us to find out why you feel the way you do."}, {"instruction": "If he just waited a little bit and then found her, oh I don't know, two weeks from now.  It would have been okay with me.", "input": "", "output": "So what makes you feel really bad is not the fact that Tony found someone.  But the fact that Tony found someone right now."}, {"instruction": "I guess if you look at it this way, I shouldn't really be feeling all that bad.  Intellectually, I know you're right.  But it still feels...", "input": "", "output": "Bad?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  It's like my self confidence has been undermined somehow.  First Bill and now Tony.  I really do deserve better.", "input": "", "output": "Now this is much better.  Remember you came to me and said that you wanted to change.  That you want to project an image of a self reliant person who needs to be treated with respect."}, {"instruction": "That's not really what I said.  But I like your version better.  So what do I do?", "input": "", "output": "Well let's start by thinking of examples.  Who do you know that is treated in the manner that you would like to be?"}, {"instruction": "You mean like a role model?", "input": "", "output": "I don't mean a famous person.  But someone who you know and are able to observe in everyday life."}, {"instruction": "Well, I did say that I wanted to be treated like Ms. Bows, for example.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  What are the qualities in Ms. Bows' interpersonal relationships and communications that you admire?"}, {"instruction": "She always comes across as very confidant, like she knows what she is doing.  I think everyone respects her, even though she had an affair.  Or even because of it.  I heard that her husband isn't very nice.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, you mentioned confidence, and respect from others.  Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "I think she is very intelligent.  But I am too, so that's not it.  I guess it's the feeling of respect that she invokes from others that I admire the most.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  What do you think makes people respect her?"}, {"instruction": "Like I said, she is intelligent.  She is in command.  I also think that she listens to what you have to say.  I think that people in general just want to be liked by her, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Do you think people want to be liked by you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I hope so.", "input": "", "output": "Let's go back to why people respect Ms. Bows.  Can you think of other reasons?"}, {"instruction": "I guess she doesn't let people push her around.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you let people push you around?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so.  Sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "I think I'd like to try something."}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "I would like for us to work out a Personal Bill of Rights for you."}, {"instruction": "That sounds interesting.  Like the right to liberty, justice, and so on?", "input": "", "output": "Something like that.  You said that you let people push you around sometimes.  Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  Sometimes it's just really hard to say no to someone, you know?  They would keep pressing and pressing and it's just sometimes easier to give in.  And sometimes I just don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.", "input": "", "output": "Like you didn't want to hurt Caren's feelings when she asked you have sex with her?"}, {"instruction": "Well, okay, like that.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that Caren would have really wanted you to have sex with her if this is something you didn't want?"}, {"instruction": "I guess not.  But I just couldn't tell her that.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't want to hurt her feelings.  I told you that.  And it wasn't all that bad.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Caren would still be your friend if you said no to her?"}, {"instruction": "Of course!  We've been friends for ages.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever say no to Caren?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  All the time.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't say no when she asked you to have sex with her and her boyfriend."}, {"instruction": "It's not a big deal.  We don't even talk about it anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Did you like that experience?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "As the first article to Anna Green Personal Bill of Rights I would like to propose the right to say no to any sexual encounter of which you are not absolutely in favor.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.  It sounds like a good rule.", "input": "", "output": "I think it's a good rule in general."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I think so too.  I guess you would be disappointed in me if I told you that I broke that rule?", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't be disappointed in you, Anna.  But I would like you to keep this rule in mind when you are faced with making these kind of decisions."}, {"instruction": "I had oral sex with David, one of the programmers, on Tuesday.", "input": "", "output": "Is it something you wanted?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  It was nice to be appreciated and wanted.", "input": "", "output": "Did you like it?"}, {"instruction": "It was okay.", "input": "", "output": "Was it reciprocated?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I didn't want him to.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?  Did he want to?"}, {"instruction": "He kept asking me to and telling me just how much he would like to touch me and so on.  But I just wasn't into it, you know?  It made me feel good to make him feel good.  That was enough.", "input": "", "output": "Would you have felt good about having intercourse with him?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  Maybe.  It doesn't matter.  I don't think I'm planning on doing anything with him again.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "I just did it to let him know how good I am.  So next time he sees me he would be thinking.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Our time is up now.  I would like you to try and internalize the First Bill of Rights.  And maybe to come up with a few others.  What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I'll try.  Next time I think of sucking someone, I'll think of the Bill of Rights.", "input": "", "output": "I mean seriously."}, {"instruction": "I know.  I know.  I'll see you next time Doctor.  Tuesday at 4 pm?", "input": "", "output": "September 3rd?  That's right.  Goodbye, Ms. Green."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor.  And I like it when you call me Anna better.  It's more personal and you sound like you care.", "input": "", "output": "I'll try to remember that, Anna.  Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Ms. Green.  How are you?"}, {"instruction": "I was better when you called me Anna.", "input": "", "output": "Did I?"}, {"instruction": "I guess you were so worried about me that it's just slipped.  But I noticed and I like it a lot.  So please don't stop.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  How are you, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "That's much better, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "I mean how was your week?"}, {"instruction": "I know what you meant.  It was okay.  You'll be happy to know that I'm over Tony completely.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that."}, {"instruction": "I still think that it would have been nice if he waited a week or two before falling in love with the first human he met right after me, but that's the way life, I mean, love is.  And in any case, these kind of relationships don't last too long anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think so?"}, {"instruction": "Love at first sight?  I just don't think so.  A relationship needs a strong friendship and a lot of common ground to last.  What does he know about her?  Her hair color?  He might not even know that for sure.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you are still a bit bitter."}, {"instruction": "Maybe just a bit.  But as I said, I don't think his love is going to last.  That's sort of my little revenge.  It makes me feel better, you know?  I mean, I don't really wish anything bad on him--just a little heart break.  Nothing much or too serious for a week's long affair.  At least nothing worse than what I felt.  Don't look at me that way, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not really being bad.  I'm just joking.  Maybe he did get lucky.  He will marry her and they will have lots of children together.  Lots of twins, I hope!", "input": "", "output": "Anna!"}, {"instruction": "There is nothing wrong with twins.  They are very cute.  You can dress them in identical clothes.  People will goo and ga over them.  It's fun!  Of course, there is a little breast feeding problem.  Each kid needs to eat every two hours, I think.  It takes about thirty minutes or so each time.  If we do the math, it comes out to be twelve hours of feeding each day every other hour.  That's of course assuming that they don't want to eat at the same time.  That's a hell of a lot of breast work right there.  And the diapers!  Twice the fun.  I've heard that can be tough on a relationship.  I just cannot imagine why, with the little darlings to love and need you twenty-four hours a day.", "input": "", "output": "This is some quite elaborate imagery, Anna.  It sounds like you might still be thinking about Tony.  Just a little bit, maybe?"}, {"instruction": "I have better things to do, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Remember I told you what I did to David last week?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do."}, {"instruction": "I just love the way he looks at me now.  I didn't give him an opportunity to talk to me in private.  I think I'll just enjoy watching him think about our encounter every time he sees me.  And I bet even when I'm not around!  Bill used to tell me that I was the best...forgive my explicitness, Doctor...that he ever had.  I wonder if men talk.  Do they Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure what you mean."}, {"instruction": "I mean do men talk about sex?  About the experiences that they had and with whom.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure that some men do.  Why do you ask?"}, {"instruction": "I just was thinking, how it would make Bill feel if he knew about David.", "input": "", "output": "How do you want him to feel?"}, {"instruction": "I not sure exactly.  Well, yes I am.  I want him to feel bad!  I'm hoping for some jealousy, anger, bitterness...things like that.", "input": "", "output": "Would that make you feel good?"}, {"instruction": "A little.  I told you, I'm through with men making me feel low.  Tony sort of derailed me from my resolution.  But as I said, I'm over that now.  I want men to want me and to treat me with a lot of respect.  I think I deserve it.  I bet David's opinion of me is pretty high right now.", "input": "", "output": "But is this what you really want?  Do you want David to think highly of you because of your sexual prowess or because of who you are?"}, {"instruction": "I want him to think that I'm smart and beautiful and sexy, all those things.  But I always felt shy and awkward.  Almost like I can do nothing right.  I have never even really talked to David before.  He always made me feel so self-conscious, you know?  He always has lots of women and friends.  He is very smart and very good looking.  I even heard that he had an affair with Ms. Bows.  I'm sure it's just a rumor--she doesn't even visit our department, much less talk to anyone there.  But what I was trying to say is that after our encounter, things changed.  I walk by and I know and I know that he knows.  And somehow it makes me feel less awkward, more like an equal or something.  I'm not really saying this right.  It's just that somehow things have changed.  I almost wish that I had done this long ago.  If I had the most popular guy in high school, my life would have been different.", "input": "", "output": "Do you regret not being sexually promiscuous in high school?"}, {"instruction": "If you put it that way, no.  But I wish I knew more, had more experience.  Maybe if my parents talked to me about sex and about relationships when I was a teenager, I wouldn't have ended up with Bill.  But I read all these romance novels.  You know the kind where there is a damsel in distress and a handsome but very modest young man comes to save her.  She usually ends up sacrificing herself to save him in the end.  Lots of tragic endings.  In retrospect, if Romeo really loved Juliet, he would have called an ambulance.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So most of my sexual awareness and experience before I met Bill came  from books.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that you had unrealistic expectations of Bill?"}, {"instruction": "I know I did.  By the way, this in no way excuses his behavior.  I was very up front with him.  I told him that I was a virgin and didn't have much experience.  But instead of being considerate of my needs, he thought of me as just another conquest.  And it was even better that I was a virgin.  You know, I asked him once how many women he had devirginized.  And he was proud to say that he took the virginity of six women.  Can you believe it?  Six!  It's like he wanted to collect trophies or something.", "input": "", "output": "How did you react when you first heard about it?"}, {"instruction": "When Bill first told me, I thought that it must have been because he is so nice, you know?  That this was because he loved women and wanted to make them feel good.  I thought that those women were lucky because Bill was a good lover and he would have done the job right.  But now, as I am saying this to you, I just can't believe that I was this naive.  It was never about those women, it was always about Bill.  It was always about what was good for Bill.  You know Doctor, it is amazing that when one is in a relationship, it is so easy to reconstruct events and actions in a way that fits one's world view.  I think back on some of the things that Bill did and said to me when we were together and I cannot believe that it didn't bother me then.  But even more then that, I would dream up elaborate explanations to excuse Bill.  I would come up with motives for Bill's behavior that I could live with.  I would sometimes tell myself that I just have to forgive Bill because his childhood was so rough--his parents weren't supportive enough, his neighborhood was a dangerous place to grow up in, his teachers just didn't understand him, and so on and so on and so on.  And I mean every little thing that I would normally find offensive I would just explain away.", "input": "", "output": "Can you think of an example?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, for instance Bill would never clean up, and would never do the laundry, and would never cook.  He thought that these were women's jobs.  His father was the same way.  And I just let him get away with it.  I thought that in time he would notice that this was unfair and would just start to feel guilty or something and would start to help.  But it never happened.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't know that you lived with Bill."}, {"instruction": "I didn't really.  I had my own place but I would spend most of my time with him.", "input": "", "output": "Who was taking care of Bill when you weren't around?"}, {"instruction": "He always had somebody.  All his girlfriends took care of him.  And I think when he was alone, and this didn't happen very often--he managed to move between relationships with a greatest of ease and in zero time--his mother would come over and take care of her baby.  His parents live relatively close--a couple of blocks away, I think.  You know, I am very happy that we are not together anymore.  In fact, I'm sort of embarrassed that we got together in the first place.  The only excuse that I have for myself is that I think that I was in love with an imaginary person.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I think I managed to create an elaborate fantasy about who Bill really was.  I attributed qualities to him that he clearly did not have.  I filled in his personality to make it fit better with what I wanted out of a man.  As I just said, I made up excuses for him when his behavior didn't match my image of him.  It was like I took Bill and filled him up with all the fantasies that I had about love and relationships.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like it might have been pretty hard to live up to that."}, {"instruction": "I suppose.  But this is all in the past and it probably was a good experience for me, sort of a dose of reality.  Hopefully, I'll know better next time, right?", "input": "", "output": "I think you're making a lot of progress.  I do though want to suggest Anna Green Bill of Rights Article number two."}, {"instruction": "Like what?", "input": "", "output": "People can like and respect Anna Green even if she doesn't have sex with them.  What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "Are you implying David?", "input": "", "output": "I think David would be a good example."}, {"instruction": "I'll think about what you mean, Doctor.  It was never my intention to use sex this way.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Our time is up for today."}, {"instruction": "Next Thursday at 4 pm?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  September 12th.  I'll see you then.  Goodbye Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor. I'm so sorry I'm this late. I was at the Seybold\nConference at the Moscone Center. SII has a booth there and I've been running\naround for the last couple of days. We are trying to feature our products\nand check out the competition and all that. You know you should go too,\nDoctor. I bet you don't know half the stuff that goes on at SII. This would\ngive you a good idea of what's out there and what we are trying to do. And\nyou might just like it, if you don't mind large crowds. Personally I get\na bit claustrophobic in situations like these but...I am really sorry that\nI'm late.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna. I understand, but do try to be on time for\nour sessions."}, {"instruction": "I'll try never to let this happen again. I hate to think\nthat you might've been angry with me.", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't angry, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Oh good. I was worried. You know, you are one of the nicest\nmen I know. Other men just wait for an opportunity to take advantage of\nyou. But you listen and understand, and I never get a feeling that you would\nuse anything I say to you to hurt me. I just hope that you don't find me\ntoo boring.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you trust me, Anna. And you really don't have\nto worry about being boring. Besides for being irrelevant, you are a complex\nand interesting woman who I venture to guess is never boring. Now why don't\nwe talk about your week. How have you been feeling?"}, {"instruction": "I've been thinking about what you said about using sex\nto get people to like me. I'm not sure that this is exactly what I'm doing.\nI think that my mannerisms come out as being flirty or something. But I\nam honestly not aware of coming on to people. And I'm always taken by surprise\nwhen men would say to me that I have been acting as if I wanted them.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think it is that men are misinterpreting?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I've always felt free to talk about things\nI feel or think. Just because I might have a fantasy about someone, doesn't\nmean that I actually want to fulfill any of it.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "One of the guys at work called me a tease. But I know\nI'm not. Just because we have cubicles next to each other and I sometimes\ncome over and rub his shoulders doesn't mean that I want him. I'm just being\nnice.", "input": "", "output": "So all you did was rub his shoulders?"}, {"instruction": "Pretty much. Well, we also talk about sex a lot. But I'm\nthe only female in my department. The guys all talk about it so I do too.\nI don't think there's anything wrong with that. They don't think of themselves\nas coming on to each other, do they? So why should it be different with\nme?", "input": "", "output": "What kind of things do they talk about?"}, {"instruction": "They talk about their dates and if they had sex. They\ntalk about what they like. Sometimes I think they do things just to see\nif I get shocked or offended. But I never do. I think it's fun. I get to\nlearn this way.", "input": "", "output": "Did they always talk about sex in front of you?"}, {"instruction": "No. Before I started to date Bill, they were always on\ntheir best behavior around me. They never even cursed or anything. I think\nthey thought of me as very proper. Or maybe Julian talked to them about\nme and how to behave.", "input": "", "output": "Julian's your boss?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. In any case, after Bill they all sort of loosened up. Somehow,\nthe whole Bill things made me more human.

And then the whole department would get together in our conference\nroom and just party. The movies usually tend to be of questionable taste.\nBut that's where I saw my first x-rated flick. I'm amazed that they like\nthis sort of thing. There's never a story line and they are not emotionally\nsatisfying a bit. They are all just about doing it. Now I just stay if they\nget some horror stuff. The porno thing is just not for me.", "input": "", "output": "Your department gets together to watch porno movies at\nSII?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. It's not a big deal, really.

I told him that I wasn't interested in\na relationship with him. And he said that was all right, he wasn't interested\nin getting seriously involved with me either. He just thought that we might\nget together just for sex. He said that since we both know that we are HIV\nnegative there wouldn't be any risk and we could really have some fun with\nno strings attached. Imagine that?

It was about a woman standing in a crowd at night watching fireworks.\nIt's really warm and she is wearing a summer dress with a long full skirt.\nThere are lots of people all around her watching the fireworks. Suddenly,\nshe feels a pair of hands gently caressing her hips. She finds this very\nexciting and it turns her on. She begins to feel a man pressing against\nher back.

I found this story very exciting somehow.", "input": "", "output": "Do you fantasize about being that woman?"}, {"instruction": "Not exactly. Please understand that in real life I would\nhate all of this. But in a fantasy...there is just something about it. A\nfeeling of being taken and being out of control somehow. I think that that\nis what turns me on. Letting go like that. Not knowing what's going to happen\nnext. When I use the vibrator, I fantasize about this feeling of being out\nof control. I'm not really sure if I'm explaining it well, Doctor. It's\nlike a feeling of surrender.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever have this fantasy when you are with a partner?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. It's much harder though. There is too much to think\nabout when you are with another person. You know the first time I had an\norgasm it was with Bill. We were having intercourse and it just took me\nby surprise. It never really happened that way again. Maybe I just knew\ntoo much or was hoping for it to happen and that interfered somehow with\nthis whole process. I don't know.

Isn't that true, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "So do you remember dreams about your patients?", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes.  Not always.  Many dreams are just never recalled\nin a wakeful state.  That's just the way human brain works.

I've even had dreams that I\nlike a lot and then try to continue them the following night.  Sort of like\na movie.  I've had some dreams that lasted about a week.

And the sound of trickling water and footsteps going through\nwater.  It was very vivid.  There was also a feeling of excitement and fear.\n And I remember my whole body reacting to being held by this man.  The tunnels\nwere cold but his arms and chest were warm.  I liked being held like that.\n It felt like he was very strong and could carry me forever if he had to.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know what he looked like?"}, {"instruction": "No, it was too dark.  I remember waking up in his arms and trying\nto understand what happened.  His voice was very calm and deep and it made\nme relax even though I didn't understand what he said.  I understood that\nhe was trying to help me.  This part of the dream I had again and again.", "input": "", "output": "The man carrying you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.

For month after this dream was over, I would try to\nthink about as I would fall asleep.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever get out of the tunnels?"}, {"instruction": "I must have.  But what attracted me most to the dream was the\ntunnels.  They were endless.  Sometimes there would be just a pin prick\nof light from far away.  And everyone would tense up, not wanting to be\ndiscovered.  But for the most part it was just sounds and smells.", "input": "", "output": "There were a lot of people in the tunnels?"}, {"instruction": "There were several people but I never knew the exact number.", "input": "", "output": "Were they all men?"}, {"instruction": "I don't remember.  There wasn't much conversation.  We didn't\nwant to be discovered.  I also remember the man's heartbeat.  I could feel\nit through my clothing against my chest.  Sometimes it almost felt like\nour hearts were synchronized, beating at the same time.  He felt so strong,\nlike he could carry me forever.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you said that."}, {"instruction": "There was a very strong sense of power about this man.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever think who this man might be?"}, {"instruction": "You mean in real life?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  Is there a parallel figure in the real world for you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.  But the funny part is that years later I went\nto see Les Miserables in New York with my parents.  And I realized that\nthe man was Jean Valjean.", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  Now I remember.  There was a section in the book where\nJean carries his daughter's fianc\u00e9 through the Paris catacombs.  Interesting.\n So you think your dream is partly based on Victor Hugo's novel?"}, {"instruction": "I read it a few years before I had the dream and must have completely\nforgotten about it.  I didn't recollect anything about it until I saw the\nBroadway version and then I immediately realized that it was part of my\ndream.  I'd even forgotten the dream by then--I was much older.  But as\nI was sitting in the audience, the flood  of memories just hit me.  I remembered\nall the smells and sounds.  It actually felt very strange sitting in the\ndark next to my parents and thinking about him.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think there was sexual content in that dream?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe.  It did give me pleasure even though not in the same way\nas an explicitly sexual fantasy would.", "input": "", "output": "Well we are out of time for today.

Mostly about you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Would you like me to talk about them?", "input": "", "output": "If you like."}, {"instruction": "I would actually.  But first I think I would like to talk about an evening with Caren.  We got together last Friday night to do the girl thing--watch a couple of movies and to just talk.  I talked a lot about you, you know.  I'm sure Caren never met a man like you.  I told her what you look like and how you play with your pencil when the conversation gets a little uncomfortable for you.  You didn't think I would notice, did you?", "input": "", "output": "I didn't...I never noticed that I do that.  And you don't make me feel uncomfortable Anna.  I'm sure that I play with the pencil all the time.  It's a bad habit.  Here, I'll put the pencil away, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Whatever you like, Doctor.  By the way, you only play with the pencil when we talk about sex.  And don't deny it. I've tested my theory on several occasions.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Should I continue talking about Caren and me?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, please. Go on."}, {"instruction": "I told Caren about your eyes.  You have the most intense eyes.  When you look at me sometimes, I feel like you are actually touching me.  Don't look away Doctor, it doesn't bother me.  I like it.  I told Caren just how much I enjoy our time together, Doctor.  There is a feeling of freedom when I lay myself open in front of you--when I allow myself to be exposed to you in the most intimate ways.  Caren couldn't begin to understand.  She's never experienced this kind of closeness.  But there was something that she brought up that made me...I don't know, a little uneasy.", "input": "", "output": "What is that?"}, {"instruction": "It's so one-sided.  I tell you everything and you tell me nothing.", "input": "", "output": "That's the nature of therapy."}, {"instruction": "I guess.  But it makes me wonder how it would have been if we met under different circumstances.  I wonder if you would have noticed me.  I think I would have noticed you.  There is something about you that I find very attractive.  I tried to describe it for Caren but I couldn't.  But I guess I have plenty of time to figure out what it is.  Right?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I was telling you about the one-sidedness of our relationship.  It is almost like you can give me pleasure but I'm not allowed to touch you.  I recognize this feeling.  Usually I'm on the other side of this kind of relationship--I'm the one to do all the giving.  You are a big change for me.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think you tend to be in unequal relationships?  Why do you think you tend to do all the giving?"}, {"instruction": "I've thought about it a lot.  I think that it's easier.  You never build up any expectations of the other person.  If I don't allow anyone to get that close to me, there is less chance of being hurt.  Right?", "input": "", "output": "What about Bill?"}, {"instruction": "Bill wasn't my idea if you remember.  I wasn't interested in him.  He pursued me and when I let him get close to me, he dumped me.  I'm not stupid. I can learn.  As long as there is a chasm between me and another person, I can stay safe.  But you...you were able to build a bridge.  The closer you get to me, the safer you make me feel.  Sometimes I have this image in my head.  Or maybe it's in my body.  I'm a rock lying on a deserted beach.  I can only look up.  I can see the sky and feel the wind rush past me.  But the tide is coming in.  I can feel the water touching my edges.  I should feel scared because I know that I will drown soon.  But I feel only pleasure.  With each wave, the water moves closer to my center.  I feel like I'm being swallowed whole.  I'm in ecstasy.  I watch the sky getting redder as the sun sets.  I begin to see stars.  All the time the water is rising.  Soon I won't be able to see the sky.  I'm sinking deeper and deeper into the water.  There is just the tiniest tip left above the water.  The next wave will roll over the top.  I will be completely wet.  As the wave rolls over and away, the wind rushes by me.  I can feel the water evaporating--the wind ripping the water molecules of my body.  I feel a chill.  But most of my body is underwater now and it is warm and caring in there.  This image is so hypnotic to me.  It is as if I become this rock for real.  I surrender to the waves, my immobile body completely unable to resist.  I think of the ocean as you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have this dream often?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I thought of describing it to Caren, but I didn't think she would understand.  I even planned a little hands-on demonstration for her.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I live in a very old Victorian apartment.  I have a huge bathroom with 12 foot ceilings and a window looking out on Coit Tower.  I set up candles all around the bathtub.  It's an old fashioned cast iron kind with lion's feet.  There's room enough for two.  When Caren came over, we had a some wine and I suggested taking a bath together.", "input": "", "output": "Was Caren interested?"}, {"instruction": "She thought it was a good idea.  I started the water and turned off the light.  We undressed under the candlelight.  I think you might like Caren.  She has a very sensuous body.  It's not beautiful in a classical sense. She has small breasts, she usually doesn't even wear a bra.  She is fairly small, only about five feet two or so.  But she seems to exude sexuality.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Really Doctor, I think you would have found her attractive.  It was already dark outside when we got into the bath.  We could see the lights of the Tower through the open window and the only other light was the lit candles.  We were facing each other, sitting in the tub, and drinking our wine.  It was a little like my rock and the ocean fantasy.  My breasts were submerged only to the tip of my nipples although Caren's were almost entirely underwater.  I started to tell her about you.  I told her about your eyes, and your lips, and your fingers.  It's rare that I get to see your whole body, but the features that I have access to I have observed and memorized to a minute detail.", "input": "", "output": "Me?"}, {"instruction": "Are you surprised? Caren said that it was turning her on to listen to me describe your fingertips.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "As I was talking I could see the expression on her face begin to change.  She was breathing heavier and heavier.  Her whole body was glistening and as she breathed, her breasts moved in and out of the water.  I'm not sure I'm very good at describing to you how it all looked and felt that evening.", "input": "", "output": "You're doing okay."}, {"instruction": "But her reaction was getting me excited too.  I hope you can understand how I felt.  I was talking to Caren about you and Caren...it was very surreal, Doctor.  I wish you could have been there.  Or better, if you could have watched unseen.  I think you would have dreamt about us then.", "input": "", "output": "So you never described to Caren your fantasy about the rock in the ocean?"}, {"instruction": "No.  It just wasn't right then.  Maybe some other time.  Doctor, you're playing with your pencil again.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?  Do you and Caren do this kind of thing often?"}, {"instruction": "You mean the whole evening or just the bath tub?", "input": "", "output": "Both."}, {"instruction": "We get together often.  Usually Caren's boyfriend is there too, though.  We order pizza and rent a movie or something.  Since Caren got involved, it's much harder to see her alone.  But I understand.  I'm sure that I behave the same way--it takes such a lot of energy and time to have a relationship that sometimes you just have to hope that old friends understand.  But we do get a chance to do the girl thing occasionally.", "input": "", "output": "Previously, you described a sexual encounter that you had with Caren as an unpleasant experience for you--something that you wanted to consummate as quickly as possible and then forget.  I'm surprised that you would purposely instigate a situation where sex with Caren might be a distinct possibility."}, {"instruction": "You mean the bath?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "If Caren were a man, I can see how the whole situation might be misinterpreted that way.", "input": "", "output": "A man taking a bath with you at your apartment with candlelight and wine might develop certain expectation, yes."}, {"instruction": "But it wasn't like that at all.  Caren's a woman.", "input": "", "output": "But you had sex with Caren previously and she liked it, right?"}, {"instruction": "I see.  I didn't think of it that way.  But she didn't ask me to do anything with her anyway so it's not an issue.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I mean the whole evening just wasn't about that.  We got together to talk about our lives and stuff.  And the other thing was just a \"one time try it and see how it is\" deal.  That was about experimenting.  Once we had done it there was no need or desire to do it again.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that's how Caren thought about it?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I assume so.  In any case, nothing happened Doctor.  Really!  I'm not a lesbian.  I can prove it.", "input": "", "output": "You don't have to prove anything to me, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Actually I would like to prove that, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What I was trying to point out is that you have put yourself into a situation where you can potentially get hurt.  I'm glad that it didn't turn out that way."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "That's not what I mean, Anna.  It's not about apologizing to me."}, {"instruction": "I know.  Sorry Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Anna."}, {"instruction": "Oh.  I'm so...I think it's just getting late and I'm not thinking straight anymore.  I usually come to work quite early on the days of our sessions so I don't have to feel guilty about leaving by four.  So my mind is fried.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay.  Our time is up anyway.  I will see you next week, October 3rd at 4 pm, okay?"}, {"instruction": "I'll be there Doctor.  Thank you very much.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye and have a good weekend."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  It's a pleasure to see you as always.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  It's nice to see you too.  How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "Some days the usual and some days not.  Would you like me to tell you Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "If you like."}, {"instruction": "At work there is basically nothing new.  I have been avoiding David but it seems that he is no longer as eager to pursue me as he was before.  Maybe he found a new love interest or something--he is a gal a week kind of guy anyway.  So as I said, work is same old same old.  But last weekend Caren and I had some fun again.  A couple of people from SII got together after work on Friday and we all went over to the East Bay.  There is this club on University Avenue--a small dump really--that features local bands.  Most were really horrible--loud and out of tune or something.  But as the evening moved on and we finished a couple of drinks, the music seemed to get better.  There is a little stage area where people were dancing.  Caren and I just let go.  We were going wild and didn't really care who we were dancing with.  We were probably mostly dancing with each other.  It's really hard to tell who you're dancing with in these kind of places anyway.  Before we knew it was something like two o'clock in the morning.  None of us were fit to drive.  So one of the guys we were dancing with said how about a swim?  That sounded really great--we were tired and hot and a swim was just what the doctor ordered, so to speak.", "input": "", "output": "Where would you go at that time of night?"}, {"instruction": "Well Caren and I just assumed it was at his place or something.  Maybe he had a hot tub or a swimming pool.  And we sort of felt like we didn't really care.  It was going to be an adventure.", "input": "", "output": "Did you know this guy?"}, {"instruction": "Nope.  We met him at this place.  But he seemed perfectly nice and it was two against one so we figured it would be okay.  Caren was a bit nervous at first but I talked her into it.", "input": "", "output": "So you went with this guy that you just met over to his place, right?"}, {"instruction": "Sounds bad I know.  It doesn't help that he probably was just as intoxicated as we were.  But he seemed to be able to drive all right and we stayed off the highway.", "input": "", "output": "You left your car behind?"}, {"instruction": "We didn't actually have a car.  We went together with a group.", "input": "", "output": "So you left your group behind.  How were you planning on getting home?"}, {"instruction": "We were going to take a taxi or get on Bart the next morning if we stayed out through the night.", "input": "", "output": "So where did you go?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently this guy didn't have a swimming pool.  He was going to stop by his house to get a few towels for us...oh and we realized that he was quite young.  He lived with his parents and was just started college.  He said he was nineteen, but we were making underage jokes the rest of the night.  He didn't seem to mind and was probably having a hell of time.  He climbed into his bedroom window so that his parents didn't know that he wasn't home.  They probably thought he was in bed like a good little boy.", "input": "", "output": "You were contributing to the delinquency of a minor."}, {"instruction": "No.  To his education.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So he got us the towels and we drove up to Lake Anza up in Berkeley Hills.  Know the place?", "input": "", "output": "No."}, {"instruction": "There is a park up there with a merry-go-round and a lake you can go swimming in.  It's a nice place.  I went on a picnic there a couple of times.", "input": "", "output": "You went swimming in this lake?"}, {"instruction": "Well the story is a little better than that.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "It's a public park and it's closed after sunset.", "input": "", "output": "You got there around two?"}, {"instruction": "It was more like three by the time we got the towels and all.  So it's completely dark.  We park the car in the parking lot that is farthest away from the lake--we don't want the rangers to know we are there.  We walk quietly to the lake in complete darkness and I kept on tripping on tree stumps and stuff because I cannot see a thing.  We finally get to the beach and the gate is closed.", "input": "", "output": "I assume this didn't stop you."}, {"instruction": "Us?  Two young agile women and a little boy?  Not a chance.  We found a place off to the side that we could climb over the fence with some ease and we were on the beach.  Our biggest problem now was that it was basically a full moon so the beach was well lit and there were no trees to provide cover.", "input": "", "output": "Could the ranger see you there from the parking lot?"}, {"instruction": "Not from the parking lot really but there is a pretty good view of the beach area from the road above.  We were worried about it.  We decided if we got caught to pretend to be international students.  I know a little Spanish and Caren knows some Italian.  Bobbie was going to keep quiet like he didn't understand English at all.  It could have worked.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe."}, {"instruction": "So the three of us started to strip and it's cold.  But finally we were completely naked and it was time to get into the water.  It was clear that Bobbie was quite affected by all this so he volunteered to go first.  So he just runs into the water.  No prep time--he jumps right in and swims to the little float a few yards away.  Caren and I are taking it easy.  We were standing knee deep in the water trying to get up the nerve to get completely in.  And then we see head lights.  We just freaked!  We grabbed our clothes and run up next to the fence.  We were scrambling to get dressed as fast as we can.  Poor kid had to swim back first.", "input": "", "output": "Did you get caught?"}, {"instruction": "We thought the ranger was going to have a ball--the three of us basically naked and wet and pretending not to speak English.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you would have been quite a sight.  Were you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  He didn't see us.  But our adrenaline was pumping.  It's just amusing how you can go from feeling cold to hot in matter of seconds.", "input": "", "output": "You were very lucky not to get caught.  Did you take the opportunity to get out of there before you did?"}, {"instruction": "No.  We figured the danger was past.  How many patrol cars does the park service have?  The park is large so the ranger would probably not be back for a while.", "input": "", "output": "So you stayed?"}, {"instruction": "We finally got into the water.  It was actually warmer than you would think at this time of the year.  We got to the float and laid on our backs watching the sky.  Well Carin and I were watching the sky, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you didn't catch a cold."}, {"instruction": "No.  It was too exciting.  But we did take advantage of Bobbie.  He probably never had two women at the same time before.  We wanted to give him a good story to tell to his friends.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you did."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think he'll remember us.  I wish you could remember us like that.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "I can't help it Doctor.  I keep thinking about you in that way.  You have no idea how many fantasies I have about you.  I even wake up at night because I'm having an orgasm just thinking about you.", "input": "", "output": "Anna this has to stop.  I cannot be your therapist if all I can do is provoke a sexual response out of you."}, {"instruction": "Doctor no!  Don't!", "input": "", "output": "Anna, it would upset me greatly to lose you as a patient..."}, {"instruction": "Then don't!", "input": "", "output": "But I have to do what is in your best interest.  For the last couple of sessions you've been deliberately trying to get a rise out me.  I can't remain impartial when your goal for coming to see me is to get me to think of you in a totally inappropriate manner.  I'm sure I can find a perfectly good therapist that would be happy to continue with you.  Anna?  Anna stop crying.  This is really the best way to go.  I have thought about it a lot and today's session just reinforces my decision.  Anna?  Please?  It's going to be all right.  Really!  Please, I'm...I just don't think that I'm the best therapist for you."}, {"instruction": "Oh Doctor.  You're the best.  Please don't give me away.  I'll be good, you'll see.", "input": "", "output": "Oh Anna.  I don't want you to be good for me."}, {"instruction": "Then I won't.  I'll do anything you want me to just please don't get rid of me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not getting rid of you Anna.  And please, please stop crying.  I just want to do what's best for you."}, {"instruction": "The best thing for me is to be with you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think so.  I think..."}, {"instruction": "Oh Doctor please!  Please don't leave me.  I've been a bad girl and I know it.  But I will change.  You'll see.  Just please don't leave me.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I don't want to leave you.  I..."}, {"instruction": "Then don't Doctor.  Please give me another chance.  I think you are good for me.  You really are.  And you know me now.  We can work on my problems.  I'm sure you can help me.  Please Doctor, don't sent me away.  I don't want anyone else.  I just won't go.  I need you.  No one else could help me.  I just won't let them.  You'll see.  My life will be ruined and it will all your fault!", "input": "", "output": "Anna you're being irrational."}, {"instruction": "I know I am.  I'm also hysterical.  Can't you see?", "input": "", "output": "I can see.  Would you like a glass of water?"}, {"instruction": "I hate water.", "input": "", "output": "You hate water?"}, {"instruction": "See!  I have lots of problems.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay not to like water."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.  You always know how to make me feel better.", "input": "", "output": "Look Anna, if you feel so strongly about this, I'm willing to give it another try.  Maybe I'm overreacting."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.  You don't know how much this means to me.  And I'll be good.  I'll be very good.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay Anna.  Let's just call it a day.  I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.  Thank you!", "input": "", "output": "Thursday then, October 10th at 4 pm."}, {"instruction": "Oh I'll be there Doctor.  And I promise, you won't regret it.", "input": "", "output": "We'll see.  Goodbye Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  You're not looking well.  Are you all right?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like there is something wrong."}, {"instruction": "I've just been feeling really tired.  I feel like my body is moving through water but on some giant planet with super gravity.  Every movement requires so much effort.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you have a cold or flu or something?"}, {"instruction": "No I don't have a fever or any other symptoms other than this enormous inertia.  I have to will myself to do things like get up from a chair to go to the bathroom.  I might have to go pee, but it feels like it would take so much effort that I wait until I can't hold it in anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think you feel this way?"}, {"instruction": "When I left your office last Thursday life just seemed so...so...it's like what's the point?  It's clear that I cannot even maintain a relationship with a psychiatrist.  I just felt so drained.  Emotionally exhausted.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't realize that you left so dispirited.  I thought we agreed to continue our sessions and that..."}, {"instruction": "You just felt sorry for me because I started to cry.  I know you would have been happier transferring me to someone else's care.  Don't lie to me Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I never lie to you, Anna.  I would honestly hate to lose you as a patient.  I just felt that I wasn't able to help you anymore."}, {"instruction": "That's what I mean--when your own therapist gives up on you who else is left?  No wonder all my relationships with men turn out the way they do.  I'm hopeless.", "input": "", "output": "You were the one to leave David.  You had the power in that relationship.  So things are changing.  You are beginning to take control."}, {"instruction": "If I hadn't dumped David, he would have tossed me out in no time.  I knew that, so I decided to do it first.  That's not taking control.  That's just seeing the reality of the situation.", "input": "", "output": "But that's a start too.  To be able to judge a relationship as unworkable for you is an important step in learning to develop positive relationships."}, {"instruction": "Nobody wants me anyway.  You don't.", "input": "", "output": "But I'm your therapist.  I have no right to want you."}, {"instruction": "You mean if you weren't my therapist you would consider going out with me?", "input": "", "output": "I'm your therapist.  I will always have been your therapist long after the date when you decide to discontinue our sessions.  Once I've been someone's therapist, if only for an hour, I'm not permitted to enter into a physical relationship with that person."}, {"instruction": "You see, you were getting to know me more intimately than any other man on Earth ever could.  Or a woman for that matter.  And yet you could never be close to me.  And while you might have ethical reasons that prevent you from thinking about me, I have nothing.  I just have my heart.  And I think of you.  And I want you.  And I'm not sure I want to stop.  Even if you can never feel the same about me.", "input": "", "output": "We're not talking about how I feel.  We're talking about the ethical limits which have been placed on me by my profession.  A patient opens themselves up to their therapist in a way that makes it inappropriate for the psychiatrist to become physically involved with their patient.  And this is why I thought it might be better for you to seek another therapist.  I didn't want you to be having unrealistic expectations about our relationship.  I'm your therapist.  Since you've identified relationships as your problem, it's my job to help you understand yourself better and form attachments with others that are healthy and productive.  Wishing for a relationship with me is not a very healthy choice.  It's what we call transference.  Mature real love can only grow and blossom when it is reciprocated.  What you feel is not love.  It's just transference."}, {"instruction": "How do you know Doctor?  Maybe it is real love.  Neither medicine nor any other science has ever claimed to know or understand what love is.  So how can you know what I feel for you?", "input": "", "output": "You're right.  I cannot claim to know what love is or how it works.  But I can reason from my past experience and education and from my insight into your psyche gained through our sessions together.  It is a very natural reaction for a patient to develop strong feelings for the person who is giving them care and understanding--their Doctor.  I'm sure you have heard of the stories of people with injuries or illnesses that took a long time to recover because they fell into what they thought was love with their nurses or doctors.  But eventually these people get better and return to their real lives.  The feeling of gratitude for their care givers remained but that feeling of love that they felt at the time of their illness--the time when they were so emotionally and physically vulnerable--went away."}, {"instruction": "Are you saying that I will find someone else and will leave you?", "input": "", "output": "You will.  You'll turn what you feel towards me towards someone else.  You'll tell me about a wonderful person that you've met and how happy you are.  You'll see.  I'll be left behind."}, {"instruction": "You are almost making me feel sorry for you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Like any doctor, my main job is to make sure that my patients get well enough never to have to see me."}, {"instruction": "So that's why you never form any attachments?", "input": "", "output": "No.  I care deeply for my patients and form very close attachments to them.  You and I are going to be very close friends, Anna.  I just have to have a certain reserve.  I always have to make sure that I'm behaving within professional guidelines."}, {"instruction": "I guess people who see therapists are very vulnerable and they would be easy to take advantage off.", "input": "", "output": "That's right.  And that's why there are strict rules on therapist and what constitutes appropriate behavior towards a patient."}, {"instruction": "But how do you feel about me?  I mean, assume for a moment that I wasn't your patient.  Would I have a shot?", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I know I shouldn't answer that.  And I never want to talk about this again, okay?  But I can see that it's important to you and I'll be honest with you.  Let me just say that you'd have a lot better than a shot."}, {"instruction": "Oh Doctor.  So you're basically saying that you do like me with all my bizarre problems and shortcomings but you can't act on your feelings in any capacity other then that of a therapist.", "input": "", "output": "That's basically correct."}, {"instruction": "You've made me feel a bit better, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad.  How was the rest of your week?"}, {"instruction": "I had an unpleasant situation at work last Friday.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to talk about it?"}, {"instruction": "Well as I said, I left your office very depressed last week.  So when I heard that my department was going to do one of those evening dinner and movie parties, I decided to stay and try to have fun.", "input": "", "output": "Was it a horror night or a porno night?"}, {"instruction": "It was a porno night, although I didn't end up staying for the movie.  I sort of felt like I was ridiculed out of their little party.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "We had pizza as usual but afterwards, instead of getting to the movie right away, David pulled out a joint and we...you don't really disapprove of this sort of thing, do you Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Getting stoned in general or getting stoned in the office?"}, {"instruction": "I guess getting stoned in the office sounds bad.  Okay, getting stoned outside the office?", "input": "", "output": "I don't believe taking illegal drugs is good idea."}, {"instruction": "Have you ever done it?", "input": "", "output": "That's not relevant, I still don't think it's a good idea."}, {"instruction": "You have, haven't you Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "So you got high with your boss in one of the SII's conference rooms, I presume?"}, {"instruction": "Good change of subject.  And to answer you, yes.  Yes I did.  We all did,   including Julian.  And then we started to talk about sex.  Mostly people were talking about what they really would like from their dates and stuff like that.", "input": "", "output": "Did you feel comfortable discussing these topics with David in the room?"}, {"instruction": "We sort of have a truce and frankly I don't care what he thinks about me.  If he's wistfully reminiscing about our last close encounter, it would only make me feel good.  I don't mind if he wants me.  As long as he doesn't bother me about it, let him pant over me.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Well at some point in the evening, it became my turn to share, so to speak.  So I told everybody about a fantasy that I had a few night before.  I mean, it wasn't a big deal.  It wasn't very explicit although it was clearly sexual.  I was really getting into the story, when I noticed that everyone was looking funny at me.  It made me really uncomfortable and I stopped.  And as soon as I stopped everyone just started to tell me that I was really weird and strange and...I just got so embarrassed that I just wanted to disappear.  They were all so cruel.  I told them something really personal and they acted like a bunch of stupid little boys.  So I just got up and left.  It made me feel like I could never find anyone to share my soul with if all men were like that.  And I thought of you and I got even more depressed.  Then I just basically ended up the whole weekend in bed watching bad movies on TV.  I didn't even have the energy to go and rent a decent movie down the street.  And then it was just horrible facing everybody on Monday morning.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think they reacted the way they did?"}, {"instruction": "Either they're a bunch of jerks or I'm just too fucked up to be among humans.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to tell me the fantasy you were trying to share with them?"}, {"instruction": "I already got one bad reaction.", "input": "", "output": "If you would rather not..."}, {"instruction": "No, no.  I'll tell you if you wish.  But you can't jump down my throat for trying to seduce you again.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "That's not what happened last time, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Whatever.  Basically I had this very erotic dream.  I mean it was erotic to me.  I was very turned on by it and was disappointed to wake up.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I was watching this cartoon.  It was about a really goofy dog but it wasn't Goofy.  It wasn't Disney at all; it was some other studio.  In any case, this dog was tall and a little clumsy and very compassionate.  Lovable really.", "input": "", "output": "Your erotic dream was about a cartoon dog?"}, {"instruction": "You see!  You're just like them.", "input": "", "output": "No, no, I'm just trying to follow your dream.  Please go on Anna."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  So I'm watching this cartoon and enjoying it and then somehow I meet the animator--the person who created this dog character.  And he is just like him--sort of tall but a little hunched over, very shy, has these very long arms with gigantic hands.  His hair is dark and curly, just like this dog.  And he has a look on his face that is really hard to describe.  It's like a combination of compassion and understanding and intelligence.  And his eyes are big and dark and they were looking at me with such a feeling of...it was just making me feel good all over.  And I was so happy to meet him.  I told him that I loved his work and his characters.  And he seemed so genuinely pleased by that.  He showed me his office and then showed me the models of this dog that he was sewing out of fake fur material.  They were very charming and lovable just like the cartoon versions.  I was so very impressed by his work.  But then he told me that he needed to go and perform.  He put on this dog outfit and just became this dog character that I liked so much.", "input": "", "output": "So the dream was actually about this animator?"}, {"instruction": "Yes and no.  They seemed to be the same entity almost.  It's hard to explain.  Somehow we both ended up in group therapy.  We were sitting in a circle with a couple of other people.  Bill was there too and we were still going out for some reason.  I was sitting next to the dog.", "input": "", "output": "So the animator was still in costume?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of.  He was the therapist and was leading the discussion.  We were sitting around a round table.  Someone was talking, describing some sort of problem they were experiencing.  I put my hand on the dog's thigh.  I felt a thrill going through my entire body.  And I knew that he felt it too.  I couldn't hear what people were saying anymore.  I was also afraid that Bill would notice something.  The dog also had to lead the discussion but I felt that he couldn't keep his attention on what was going on either.  We found an excuse to break up the meeting for awhile and the dog and I ended up on a flight of stairs alone.  He was towering over me and bending down to get really close to my face.  And then we kissed.  It was so passionate and so innocent.  It was as if he loved me forever--even before we ever met.  I was feeling guilty and confused.  But mostly it was this feeling of happiness to be with him.  I woke up desperately wanting to make love to him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's okay.  Now you can tell me how screwed up I am.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you're screwed up."}, {"instruction": "I just dream about making love to animated dogs.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like it was more a dream about meeting someone with characteristics that you find appealing."}, {"instruction": "Like the dog being a therapist, for example?", "input": "", "output": "That's not what I meant."}, {"instruction": "In any case, the dream was not well-received by the friends in my department.", "input": "", "output": "You told them the whole thing?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I was telling them about my fantasy the way they were telling me about theirs.  It was my turn.", "input": "", "output": "Were the fantasies they were telling as metaphorical as yours?"}, {"instruction": "They were a lot more graphic.", "input": "", "output": "I thought so.  I think they were just not expecting anything so personal.  Maybe they got embarrassed and just made fun of you to cover up their own discomfort."}, {"instruction": "Or maybe they just behaved like assholes.", "input": "", "output": "That too.  I don't think there is anything wrong with your dream, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You know our time is up?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Next time if you feel this bad after leaving our sessions or for any other reason, please call me.  I'm here to help really."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I'll see you next Thursday at 4 pm.  That's October 17th."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Anna.  Try to feel better."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  Isn't this a beautiful day?  I love this time of the year in San Francisco--everything is bright and sunny and yet there is a certain autumn chill in the air.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  You sound in a very good mood today."}, {"instruction": "I am Doctor.  I bought a sandwich and went out on the waterfront to eat my lunch.  It was so nice with the sun and the birds and the ships going by.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you had a good time.  I was a bit worried about you."}, {"instruction": "You mean the last session?  You made me feel a lot better.  It was nice to hear that you actually care about me.", "input": "", "output": "I do very much.  I would like to talk to you about some of your fantasies today."}, {"instruction": "I knew the animated dog would make you think that I was a bit out there.  Is that what you want to talk to me about?", "input": "", "output": "Actually I just wanted to talk about fantasies in general.  What do you think a fantasy is?"}, {"instruction": "Well it's a dream, I guess.  Although sometimes fantasies happen when you're not asleep, so maybe fantasies are just unexpected thoughts and visions that come to mind.", "input": "", "output": "Do you believe that a person has no control over their fantasies?"}, {"instruction": "Not exactly.  I think that there is an initial thought that starts the fantasy and after that a person has some degree of control.  Also the amount of control we have over a fantasy depends on when it happens.  If I'm asleep, I have little control over which direction the fantasy will take.  But If I'm awake or only sleeping half-way, then I'm like a movie director.  I can change the storyline, or I can change the way the story is told--like taking multiple takes of the same scene, or I can play the same scene over and over again if I really enjoy it.  I always assumed that everybody did this, right?", "input": "", "output": "Some people have more control over their fantasies and some less.  I think you are right and it very much depends on whether a person is sleeping or awake.  What I would like is for you to give examples of the kinds of fantasies you are having."}, {"instruction": "Well I told you a few of my fantasies.  The animated dog is one.", "input": "", "output": "Are there others?"}, {"instruction": "I told you about the catacombs in Paris and the alien patrol ships.", "input": "", "output": "With both of these fantasies you had a lot of control over their direction.  You even mentioned trying to make the fantasy or dream happen again and again over a series of nights."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I like those type of fantasies the best.  I like to have control and watch them again and again if I want to.", "input": "", "output": "What about fantasies or dreams that you don't have control over?"}, {"instruction": "I have a fair number of those as well.  A lot of times though, when I wake up I know I had an interesting dream, but it seems to slip away as I get more awake.  I try to remember what has happened but I cannot.", "input": "", "output": "That's fairly common with dreams.  People have far more dreams during the night than they ever remember having."}, {"instruction": "Sounds like we are missing out on a lot of fun.", "input": "", "output": "Do you sometimes try to initiate a fantasy?"}, {"instruction": "You mean like daydreaming?", "input": "", "output": "Do you daydream?"}, {"instruction": "Yes I do.  A lot as a matter of fact.  I find that it is a good way of relaxing and switching gears, so to speak, at work.", "input": "", "output": "Do your fantasies feel real to you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure what you mean.  But when I was a little girl, I remember making up stories and telling them to my parents and after a while I couldn't tell if what I was saying to them was real or just my imagination.  It was almost as if when I thought about something for a long time and talked about it, it became real.  I know that in some instances I would have passed a lie detector test.", "input": "", "output": "Do you still have problems telling the difference between reality and fantasy sometimes?"}, {"instruction": "You mean am I crazy?  I don't think so.  I was a kid when I did that.  Probably all children do it.  It doesn't mean that they turn out to be crazy.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you are crazy Anna.  I just wanted to find out if some of the fantasies that you have as an adult now take on the same quality of reality as those childhood stories you told to your parents."}, {"instruction": "You mean if after a long exposure to a fantasy I begin to believe that it's real?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "No.  I'm pretty sure I can tell the difference between reality and fantasy.  But why are you being so weird today, Doctor?  Did I do something to make you believe that I'm delusional?", "input": "", "output": "No.  I just wanted to know..."}, {"instruction": "About my dreams?  I would be happy to tell you all my dreams Doctor.  You just have to promise not to throw me out.  Quite a number of them are about you.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Let's talk a little about the sexual fantasies that you have when you are awake."}, {"instruction": "Doctor I thought you'd never ask.  I would be delighted!", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Over our sessions together, you have told me quite a number of fairly erotic stories about yourself.  It's quite natural for people to exaggerate some parts of their stories to make them more interesting to their audience."}, {"instruction": "Doctor are implying that I lie to you?", "input": "", "output": "No.  But I'm interested in whether you sometimes exaggerated your stories?"}, {"instruction": "Well, sometimes I omit certain details that I don't think are important to the overall story.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I might have on occasion over described certain things.", "input": "", "output": "Like what things?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor I feel like you are angry at me.  You are making me very uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "That's not my intention at all Anna.  I'm sorry if I'm making you feel bad.  I'm just trying to understand you.  I was thinking about you this week and upon going over my notes I realized that it might be an interesting exercise to talk about fantasies.  You seem to have a very rich fantasy life and I think it's important that we explore it during our sessions.  Don't you?"}, {"instruction": "I guess Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "So I though we would talk about some of the stories you told me and..."}, {"instruction": "Check how much of my stories are real and how much of them are just my fantasies?", "input": "", "output": "Are some of your stories fantasies Anna?"}, {"instruction": "I...I...maybe partially.", "input": "", "output": "Well why don't we pick one.  How about the story about you and Caren going skinny dipping in Lake Anza?"}, {"instruction": "We had a really good time.", "input": "", "output": "That's good.  Did you actually go in the water?"}, {"instruction": "I did.", "input": "", "output": "Did Caren?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she sort of stayed on the beach as a look out.", "input": "", "output": "So she didn't get in the water."}, {"instruction": "No, actually she didn't.", "input": "", "output": "So Caren didn't swim out to the float with you and the young man you were with?"}, {"instruction": "No she was on the look out for rangers.  We were very scared of getting caught.", "input": "", "output": "That's fair enough.  Did you and the young man you were with engage in any sexual activities?"}, {"instruction": "We kissed.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "I touched him.", "input": "", "output": "You touched his genital area?"}, {"instruction": "I came close.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Why do you think you expanded on your story when you told it to me?"}, {"instruction": "I thought it was more interesting that way.  And I thought about doing all the things I told you about.  I just didn't actually do them at the time.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like that by telling me the story with sexually explicit elaborations you made it more interesting for me?"}, {"instruction": "I hope it was more interesting that way.  It is more interesting to me.  And that is how it could have happened.", "input": "", "output": "But it didn't?"}, {"instruction": "No.  But I thought about it a lot and that is how it should have happened.", "input": "", "output": "Why should it have happened that way?"}, {"instruction": "Because if it was someone else--other than me I mean--they would have made love out under the stars and it would have been very romantic.", "input": "", "output": "So you don't think that swimming naked with a man out at night into the middle of a lake and kissing and touching him is romantic enough?"}, {"instruction": "Sounds pretty good when you say it.  But I think it's better my way.", "input": "", "output": "It might be a better story, but you have represented it as completely true to me.  I have no way of telling apart which parts of your stories are real and which are fantasies."}, {"instruction": "Does it really matter though?  It is all about how I feel and how I view my world.  What difference does it really make?", "input": "", "output": "Some of the stories you related to me are about you getting hurt or abused.  I would like to know if the abuse is real or part of your fantasy life.  Don't you think it is important for a therapist to know whether his patient's suffering has external origins or whether it is partly self inflicted?"}, {"instruction": "I see your point.  But if I'm describing an event that caused me pain, I'm describing it in way that is most comfortable for me.", "input": "", "output": "You once talked about an unwanted sexual encounter with Caren.  That wasn't really true, was it?"}, {"instruction": "Did you speak with Caren?  Is this what this is all about?  Did Caren tell you something about me?  I'll kill her!", "input": "", "output": "This is not about Caren.  I just wanted to know if you really had sex with her or if what you described to me was a fantasy."}, {"instruction": "She called and told you that I'd been lying to you, didn't she?  What a bitch!", "input": "", "output": "I'm not talking about Caren.  I want to know about you Anna.  You described to me a situation which you went along with Caren's desire to have sex with you merely to avoid hurting her feelings.  Did you actually allow Caren to make love to you?"}, {"instruction": "It doesn't matter!", "input": "", "output": "Anna I need to know what is the truth.  If you are having destructive fantasies about your sex life we need to talk about in our sessions.  Fantasies of submitting to unwanted sexual advances are quite different from actually being powerless to stop unwanted sexual advances in real life, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "I could have said no.  I chose not to.", "input": "", "output": "But you said that you hated it and couldn't wait for it to be over with.  You even spoke about faking an orgasm to expedite the conclusion to this act."}, {"instruction": "I think it was a reasonable thing to do.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not talking about that.  I want to know if it in fact happened the way you described it to me."}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  I guess most of it.", "input": "", "output": "Most of it was real or most of it was fantasy?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know Doctor.  Stop it!", "input": "", "output": "You never had sex with Caren, did you?"}, {"instruction": "Stop it Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "Okay, let's stop for today.  But I will be coming back to this subject during our next session."}, {"instruction": "I don't know about that.", "input": "", "output": "Well we can try, okay?"}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it.  Next week at the same time?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  Thursday the 24th at 4 pm.  And please Anna, my goal is not to make you upset.  I just want to understand you and help you to understand yourself better.  I think you'll have healthier relationships in the future if we can do that.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Anna.  Call me if you need to."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  Are you going to make me feel bad again today?", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  It's never my intention to make you feel bad."}, {"instruction": "That's not true.  Last session I felt like you were interrogating me.  You were trying to make me say that I was lying to you or something.  Isn't that true?", "input": "", "output": "I was just trying to talk to you about the difference between reality and fantasy.  Both are very important.  But it is also important for me to know which you are talking about.  I honestly wasn't trying to make you feel bad, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I see.", "input": "", "output": "For example, last time we talked about you and Caren and whether she actually did make love to you.  I believe you admitted that it didn't actually happen the way you described it to me."}, {"instruction": "That's not true, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You mean Caren did make love to you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  You know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "I never told you--admitted, the way you put it--that Caren didn't actually make love to me.  You are trying to manipulate me to tell you something wasn't true.  I don't know why you think you can play these kinds of games with me, Doctor.  Do you think that I'm dumb or have a poor memory or something?", "input": "", "output": "No Anna.  I think you are extremely smart.  But I am worried that your fantasy life might be interfering with your real relationships with people.  I am also worried that some of your fantasies are about self-destruction."}, {"instruction": "How would you know if you think that I'm a liar?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that you are trying to deceive me on purpose.  I think that your stories sometimes get away from you.  You lose control and reality and fantasy mix together."}, {"instruction": "You told me that you liked me!  And now you're saying that I'm crazy?  That I don't have a good grasp on reality?  Which is it Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I do like you Anna.  I was hoping that by now, after all this time together, you would believe me."}, {"instruction": "Well I love you Doctor.  And I was hoping that after all this time together you would notice.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, we talked about this before.  You know the rules.  We can never have a relationship.  Even if I stopped our sessions right now, I would always have been your therapist and as such could never hope, dream, or even think about a relationship with you other than that of a therapist and a patient.  You do understand?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  It seems like psychiatrists wouldn't have such unrealistic expectations of humans and their behavior.  What if I go away and have plastic surgery.  I'd look like a completely different person and then we meet again about twenty years from now.  We fall in love but you never know who I am.  We get married and, after our first anniversary, I tell you that I used to be your patient.  What would you do, divorce me?  What if we have children together by then?", "input": "", "output": "That's quite an elaborate set of circumstances.  Do you think that two people could love each other and get married if one of them is lying the entire time and pretending to be something she is not?"}, {"instruction": "Here you go again--accusing me of lying.", "input": "", "output": "No.  I was working within your fantasy.  Do you think that two people could really be in love if their relationship is built on a lie?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  Well maybe not.  But what if I don't remember you.  What if the reason that I had the plastic surgery was because I was in a terrible accident.  Let's say I was in a plane crash and survived but lost part of my memory.  Then the relationship would not be based on a lie.  And would it be fair to get a divorce because of a misunderstanding?", "input": "", "output": "Well, if you lost all your memories of our sessions together and I had not recognized you as Anna Green, I suppose we would be able to stay married and keep our children."}, {"instruction": "Doctor you are making fun of me.", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think that this elaborate hypothetical is a little absurd?"}, {"instruction": "I admit--it's a little far fetched.  But it could happen.", "input": "", "output": "In a soap opera maybe."}, {"instruction": "Well, in a soap opera I could even be dead for a couple of years and then come back and marry you.  There are no laws about marrying dead people are there?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know, that's not my speciality.  I'm glad you're not as angry at me anymore."}, {"instruction": "I'm not good at staying angry with people.  I'm far better at being hurt and feeling pain for a long time.", "input": "", "output": "I sincerely hope that I will never be a source of pain for you Anna.  I really care a lot about you and what happens to you."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.  I want you to care about what happens to me.  I want you to care a lot.", "input": "", "output": "Is it why you tell me your fantasies?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe.  I always wonder about how you look at the world.  You see people that are screwed up or disturbed in some profound ways.  I know you have been seeing Helen, the janitor woman.  She is really out there and needs your help.  I'm...there isn't very much wrong with me, other than having zero ability and no skill for developing relationships.  But that is not very serious.  Why waste your time on me?  You must have better things to do.", "input": "", "output": "I don't feel like I'm wasting my time during our sessions.  I would love very much to help you.  I think you are a beautiful, sexy, smart, and very sensitive woman.  I would like to help you find confidence and feel secure in your relationships with other people.  Do you think our sessions  are helping you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I think so.  I was very upset with you last week, so it's hard for me to tell you today how beneficial our sessions have been.", "input": "", "output": "That's fair.  Maybe after you think about it."}, {"instruction": "I had a fight with Caren last week because of you too.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that.  Caren is a very good friend of yours and she cares very deeply about you.  I hope you worked things out."}, {"instruction": "Not all the way.  I think that some things are very personal and a therapist is one of them.  I think it was very wrong of Caren to call you.", "input": "", "output": "She was just trying to help."}, {"instruction": "She stepped over the line--there are some things that even a friend should not interfere in.  She's done it before too.", "input": "", "output": "What did she do?"}, {"instruction": "When I got pregnant with Bill, I told her about it.  I wanted her support and sympathy I guess.  But she was very weird about it.", "input": "", "output": "Did she..."}, {"instruction": "She just got too involved in the whole process--started to tell me what I should and shouldn't do.  Got very offended when I told her that I needed to do things my way.  Stuff like that.", "input": "", "output": "Could you give an example?"}, {"instruction": "I had a very bad abortion.  I went to this doctor and he yelled at me for taking so long to make up my mind.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I got the abortion at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you wait so long?  It's more dangerous..."}, {"instruction": "I know.  I know.  But I wasn't ready before then.  It's a hard thing to do and Bill was also...well you know the story.", "input": "", "output": "A little.  What happened to you after the abortion?"}, {"instruction": "I got very sick.  I kept bleeding for three months.  It was bad.", "input": "", "output": "Did you go back to the doctor?  Did you seek medical attention?"}, {"instruction": "I felt really bad for what I have done and...you really not going to like this Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay."}, {"instruction": "I just sort of felt like I deserved it.", "input": "", "output": "You thought that you deserved to be in pain and to be sick?"}, {"instruction": "Like a punishment or something.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know what was wrong with you?"}, {"instruction": "I was taking some night classes at the time so I just went to see the school nurse.  Caren went with me.  She insisted.  The nurse took my blood to check for hormone levels or something.  I was too out of it to really pay attention.  The next day I got a call from the school's infirmary.  They said that my hormone levels were not dropping back to normal--there was a possibility that abortion didn't go through or something.", "input": "", "output": "You mean they told you you might still be pregnant after the abortion?"}, {"instruction": "Something like that.  I had these images of a baby all torn apart inside of me, bleeding to death.  It was horrible.", "input": "", "output": "Did the nurse call your doctor?  The one who performed the abortion?  They always check.  The doctor should have been contacted if there was something wrong."}, {"instruction": "No.  They kept taking my blood every day for the next couple of weeks--keep checking those hormone levels.  My arms began to look like I was addicted to heroin or something.  I had these blood pockets under my skin that would form on their own and just move around and down my wrists.  I had to wear long-sleeved shirts.", "input": "", "output": "That nurse didn't know what she was doing.  It's outrageous what they did to you."}, {"instruction": "Eventually they called the doctor and I came to see him again.  I really didn't want to do it because that whole place was just so...so...it gave me the creeps.", "input": "", "output": "Did the doctor find out what was wrong with you?"}, {"instruction": "Not really.  He did tell me that I didn't have a dead fetus inside of me.  That was good.  But he didn't know why I was bleeding so much.  He ended up giving me birth control pills.  He said that they would stabilize my hormones and end the bleeding.  It worked.", "input": "", "output": "And the entire time you felt like you were being punished?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And how did Caren interfere with your getting help?"}, {"instruction": "She was just too pushy.  I wanted to be left alone.  As I said, I wanted to be punished.  What I did was a pretty horrendous thing to do.  She just kept bothering me.  She had no idea how I was feeling.  She went too far and I told her that.", "input": "", "output": "So is Caren upset with you now?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.  We had it out and cried together.  She thinks that we are okay now.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I guess we are okay.  I just don't think I can trust her any more.", "input": "", "output": "I think her motives were good."}, {"instruction": "It doesn't matter.  There are personal boundaries that even good friends have to observe.  You should know that Doctor.  You are full of personal boundaries.", "input": "", "output": "Well we can talk more about it during our next session.  Next Thursday, October 31st at 4 pm?"}, {"instruction": "Actually I would like to change that session to another day.  It's Halloween and I would like...", "input": "", "output": "No problem.  I didn't realize it was a holiday."}, {"instruction": "This is San Francisco.  Have you been here for Halloween before?", "input": "", "output": "No."}, {"instruction": "You are in for a treat.  Or a trick, depending on your point of view.  Halloween is San Francisco's big holiday.  Like Carnival in Rio.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to cancel all together or would you like to come in on Friday?  I usually don't take patients that day, but I will be here anyway.  How about 4 pm on Friday the 1st?"}, {"instruction": "That works for me.  Thank you for being flexible Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "No problem.  Goodbye Anna."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye Doctor.  Enjoy Halloween!", "input": "", "output": "Oh wait a minute Anna.  You mentioned Helen before.  Do you know what happened to her?"}, {"instruction": "Not really.  She seemed to disappear.  At first everyone just thought that she was sick or something.  But after she stopped coming to work for a week we just assumed that she just took off or something.  She was very strange, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Did she ever just take off before?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I suppose so.  Oh and the police came about two weeks ago to ask about her.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't hear about that."}, {"instruction": "Well you're not in the building, thank god.  They just asked some questions but nobody knew anything.  You think something happened to her?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know.  But thank you for telling me about Helen."}, {"instruction": "No problem Doctor.  Have a good weekend.", "input": "", "output": "You too."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  How was the Halloween party last night?"}, {"instruction": "What Halloween party?", "input": "", "output": "Didn't you say you were going somewhere?  We changed the session to today?"}, {"instruction": "Oh no. I didn't go to a party.  I just went wandering the streets with a bunch of friends.  And I did have a good time, thank you.  How was your Halloween?", "input": "", "output": "I went to check out the parade too.  But I only stayed out for about half hour.  It's not my kind of scene."}, {"instruction": "No, I imagine not.  Did you wear a costume at least?", "input": "", "output": "I put on a lab coat and a stethoscope."}, {"instruction": "I see.  Trying to blend in with the crowd eh?", "input": "", "output": "I didn't want to call attention to myself."}, {"instruction": "I guess you succeeded?", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you tell me about your Halloween.  Mine really wasn't all that exciting."}, {"instruction": "I believe that.  Maybe next year you could go as a mailman or maybe a UPS man?", "input": "", "output": "Thank you for the suggestions Anna.  Lets talk about you."}, {"instruction": "I had a much better evening.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Why don't you tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "I was a bit more daring in my costume than you were, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure."}, {"instruction": "I was dressed as an alien prostitute.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I had four breasts, three eyes, gold hair down to my knees, and the most outrageous red space dress.  It was really a lot of fun.  It felt like I became another person for a night--more daring, more exciting, and a lot more self confidant.", "input": "", "output": "Did you just walk the streets dressed like that or..."}, {"instruction": "We sort of went down Polk Street from bar to bar, looking at people's costumes and letting them admire ours.  People get really friendly at times like these--sort of lose some of the social taboos.  Strangers would come up to me and compliment me on my costume.  Some asked how I made the second pair of breasts--were they silicone or papier-mache?  There were a few that even wanted to touch them.", "input": "", "output": "Were they bare?"}, {"instruction": "Of course they were.  Don't look at me like that Doctor.  They weren't real or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I got them at one of those kind of stores in North Beach.  They are quite realistic.  In any case, it was sort of liberating to put on this outrageous persona.  I felt free to flirt with strangers, to start conversations...it was a lot of fun.  And I felt like everything I did was anonymous somehow.  Do you understand?", "input": "", "output": "Because no one knew who you really were?"}, {"instruction": "Precisely!  I felt free to lie to people about where I lived, what my telephone number was, even my name changed about a hundred times during the night.  I felt like I could do things that I would never do in real life.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of things?"}, {"instruction": "Well like talking to strangers but more.  I felt very uninhibited.  There was this one guy who was dressed as a cop but in an all leather uniform.  He came to me and said that he wanted to arrest me.  I just looked at him and asked if there was anything I could do to change his mind and I mean anything.  I was saying all this in a very sultry voice trying to be as sexy as I could.", "input": "", "output": "Was there something you could do?"}, {"instruction": "The pay off was a kiss.  But I mean a real kiss.  It was very exciting.  Everyone was watching as if we were part of a movie scene.  He was a complete stranger to me.  But he came to me and acted out a part of a corrupt law enforcement officer.  And I didn't hesitate to play my part of a street smart alien hooker.  It was great fun.  We were even applauded.", "input": "", "output": "It does sound very exciting.  Are you sure it all happened the way you are describing?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Is there a fantasy component to this story?"}, {"instruction": "No there is not.  Would you like me to bring in pictures?  Or would you rather talk to my friends that witnessed the whole thing?", "input": "", "output": "Don't get so defensive Anna.  I just feel compelled to check due to our previous discussions."}, {"instruction": "Well do you need proof?", "input": "", "output": "That's fine.  I trust you."}, {"instruction": "Are you sure?  Deep down inside are you sure?  Maybe I'm just trying to get you to tap your pencil again?", "input": "", "output": "Stop it Anna.  Let's continue talking about your evening."}, {"instruction": "As you wish.  So as I was saying, we were moving from bar to bar doing a lot of people watching.  Early in the evening there were a lot of kids on the streets.  They were going into the stores to get their treats.  I'm always a little surprised to see kids doing that.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I grew up in Davis.  It's pretty small town.  The kids would dress up in costumes and go from house to house.  It all felt very safe--suburban Halloween.  But here these little kids were among very strange adults dressed in very sexually explicit costumes.", "input": "", "output": "Like you."}, {"instruction": "Yes like me.  It just made me feel very uneasy.", "input": "", "output": "Because of the way you were dressed?"}, {"instruction": "I tried to cover up a bit when I saw kids walking past me.  But that wasn't really it.  It just felt like it was dangerous for these kids to be out on the street like that.  What were their parents thinking?  I would never let my kids wander the streets of San Francisco on Halloween night.  It's just crazy!  Anything could happen.", "input": "", "output": "How late was it when you saw these children?"}, {"instruction": "I saw kids on the street until about ten or so.  But most of the really young ones did go away after about eight-thirty.  And there were some parents too, but still... when I have kids I will take them over my parents' where it's safe.", "input": "", "output": "How late did you stay out?"}, {"instruction": "Oh we got there about seven, seven thirty or so.  Walked around a bit to get a sense of what was going on.  We stopped to get drinks a couple of times and to just warm up a bit.  My costume was hot but it didn't provide much heat.  I got really cold a couple of times and the drinks were essential to keeping me from getting completely frozen.", "input": "", "output": "Did you get drunk?"}, {"instruction": "You sound like my father.  I'm over eighteen you know.  But no I didn't get drunk.  I felt it but I was not drunk.  I did get stoned later on.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Somebody brought some pot and I took a hit or two.  Except that it was very weird.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well I've smoked pot before, I told you that.  I'm not a heavy user or anything.  I wouldn't even know how to get some if I ever wanted to.  But I do have some experience however limited.  I know how it should taste like and how it should feel.", "input": "", "output": "The stuff that you had last night was different somehow?"}, {"instruction": "Yes it was.  Usually I take a couple of puffs and I sort of feel it a little and then I stop.  But last night I took two hits and I felt completely gone.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "It was like time stopped existing.  I mean I knew that time was passing because my watch kept showing a different time.  But for my body and mind it felt like this one long stretched out moment.", "input": "", "output": "Where were you when this happened?"}, {"instruction": "We were at this apartment.  It was in the neighborhood and when someone mentioned getting high it made more sense to go somewhere more private.  I remember it was in these dingy apartment buildings but the apartment was very nice.  It had twelve foot ceilings and bay windows.  There was a long corridor running down the middle with some bedrooms on each side.  At the end opposite the entrance was the kitchen.  We could see the street from the kitchen windows which were wide open so that the sounds and the air were pouring in.  I was standing next to the window looking outside when it hit me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And it really did hit me.  It was like one minute I was fine and having a conversation and the next I was frozen in time.", "input": "", "output": "Did other people react in the same way?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I couldn't ask then.  I couldn't do much at all at that point.", "input": "", "output": "Did you see what people were doing?"}, {"instruction": "The conversation seemed to stop and everyone was touching and kissing each other.  Well almost everyone.  There were a few people who seemed to be as frozen as I was.", "input": "", "output": "So you didn't engage in any sexual activity?"}, {"instruction": "Not exactly.", "input": "", "output": "Did you or didn't you?"}, {"instruction": "Not exactly.  I didn't touch anyone and no one touched me.  I was watching all these people making out.  Some were even openly having sex in the corners.  I was watching this one couple in the corner behind the refrigerator.  He was leaning against the wall and was screaming in ecstasy while this woman in a Tarzan suit was going down on him.  Or it might have been a man--I'm not sure.  And all of this was just happening in this no time feeling.  I was watching them and it could have been a minute but it might have been an hour.  My time perception really changed in a strange kind of way.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have any other symptoms?  Dizziness?  Nausea?  Did your body feel strange?  Sort of heavy?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I didn't feel like I lost control over my body.  It just felt like I really didn't want to move.  I could but I just really really didn't want to.  Does it make sense?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "And it was also not like I was having a memory lapse.  I knew and saw everything that was happening around me.  At least as long as it was in my line of sight--I wasn't interested or willing to move my head either.", "input": "", "output": "So how long do you think this state of no time lasted?"}, {"instruction": "In about an hour I noticed that an hour had past.", "input": "", "output": "You spent that hour motionless, watching other people have sex?"}, {"instruction": "Not all of them were having sex.  Just some.  And when I started to get my sense of time back, I realized just how much I wanted it too.", "input": "", "output": "Wanted to have sex?"}, {"instruction": "I just got very turned on watching everybody.  I guess that's why porno movies are so popular.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I was standing with my back to the window next to the corner of the kitchen table.  I sort of used the corner.", "input": "", "output": "You masturbated with the corner of the kitchen table?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Did it work?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Did you feel self conscious doing it in front of all those people?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think anybody knew.  I was very discrete.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "In fact you are the only one who really knows about this Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Well sounds like you had quite an evening.  Did you get home all right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  No problem.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Next Thursday at four then?"}, {"instruction": "I'll be here.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  I'll see you November 6th.  Try to stay out of trouble."}, {"instruction": "I'll do my best Doctor.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  How was your week?  How are you feeling?", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  Those are my lines.  How was your week?  How are you feeling?"}, {"instruction": "My week was pretty lousy.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Bill got himself a new girl.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Does that bother you?"}, {"instruction": "I've always fantasized about how it would feel.  I tried to prepare myself emotionally for that--sort of pretending like it had already happened so I could feel just how much it would hurt.  This way when it happened for real I would be all ready for it.  But I didn't think that it would be so bad.", "input": "", "output": "So you would imagine Bill with some other woman and..."}, {"instruction": "I just wanted to try it out, so to speak.  See how it would feel.  I imagined him making love to a very beautiful woman and doing all the things that we did together--like the way he would hold me or the position we liked the most.  I know it sounds sick.", "input": "", "output": "No..."}, {"instruction": "I do this a lot.", "input": "", "output": "Do what?"}, {"instruction": "Imagine the future so I can get used to it before it happens.  This way it's as if I've lived through a particular unpleasant moment already and it's easier for me to live through it when it really happens.  Do you understand?", "input": "", "output": "Yes I think I do.  A lot of people try to visualize particular events in the future.  Do you only visualize bad things?"}, {"instruction": "Mostly.  If it's a good thing, I don't mind being surprised.  It's only the bad and unpleasant events for which I like to prepare.", "input": "", "output": "What are some of those bad events?"}, {"instruction": "When I was still in school, I used to imagine how it would feel to fail a test, you know?  How devastated I would be.  How dumb I would feel.  How much my parents would be disappointed in me.  Stuff like that.", "input": "", "output": "Can you give me more examples?"}, {"instruction": "I used to imagine how it would feel to swallow a pill, for example.  I'm not good at taking pills--they always get stuck in my throat.  So before taking one I would remember all my experiences of taking pills previously.  Sometimes these memories are so clear and complete that I even throw up before taking the pill.", "input": "", "output": "Than why do you do it?"}, {"instruction": "An imaginary pill is still better than a real one.", "input": "", "output": "Do you take the pill after having such an unpleasant visualization?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.  I hate being sick.  I just remember how bad it was the last time I was sick and there is no hesitation.", "input": "", "output": "So do you visualize the sickness as well?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But it's not like I relive it or anything.  It's more like having lots of images of particular instances and for the most part it's remembering the feeling of being sick.  I'm not sure I can really explain it well.  The images and feelings come in a flood all at once--there is no time element to them.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Would you like to hear more examples?", "input": "", "output": "Yes I would."}, {"instruction": "I imagined how it would be taking a driving test for months before it actually happened.  Actually I guess this is similar to imagining school tests with just a touch more activity.  Let me see.  Before my interview at SII, I've spent two solid weeks dreaming about nothing else.", "input": "", "output": "So some of these visualizations happen in your dreams?"}, {"instruction": "They are on-going--they happen during the day and the night.  And they almost completely go away after the event has happened.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes they persist even afterwards?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of  like a flashback twitch or something--really quick and with a shudder.  This mostly happens for really unpleasant things.  Never with stuff like taking pills.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "But what I started to tell you about today was Bill and his new love Ethel.  Can I go on?", "input": "", "output": "Of course."}, {"instruction": "Well she works for SII too.  I remember how Suzie's husband used to go all white when he saw her in the hallways flirting with other men after their divorce.  I always tried to put myself in his place.  When I did, I could almost feel my body's posture change and I would get this panicky feeling in my gut.  Then I would snap out of it and feel really sorry for him.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever imagine yourself in Suzie's place?"}, {"instruction": "No never.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  It's just not me.", "input": "", "output": "Remember when you had a date with David, the handsome programmer?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, our local Don Juan.  What about him?", "input": "", "output": "You talked about how you wanted Bill to see the two of you together."}, {"instruction": "That was a very positive fantasy.  I liked it a lot.", "input": "", "output": "Was this positive fantasy similar in quality to the negative visualizations of the future that you do?"}, {"instruction": "No.  It's really different.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "It didn't have the persistence of the negative ones, for one thing.  And it...it's just different.", "input": "", "output": "It wasn't as intense?  Not as full of images and feelings?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe.  The negative events I can almost play out as a story in my head.  Almost like a film.", "input": "", "output": "Like your dreams?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Some of my dreams are like that.  I told you about them.", "input": "", "output": "The Paris catacombs and the alien patrol ships."}, {"instruction": "That's right.  But what I was trying to say about Bill is that it is very hard for me to see him with Ethel.  Last week I caught them making out in the programmers' lounge, just like we used to do.  They walk around holding hands and kissing around corners.  She goes over to his cubicle and sits on his lap.  They talk to each other on the phone all day.  Bill and I did all that.  And now he is doing it with someone else.  It's like all the pain that I felt right after our break up is coming back in this giant wave.  I almost feel like I can drown in it.", "input": "", "output": "Is the pain as intense as when you first came to see me?"}, {"instruction": "It's duller.  More like an echo of the real pain.  But I've been feeling really emotionally fragile lately so it's still difficult to deal with it.  And none of my negative imagery seemed to help.", "input": "", "output": "Does it ever help?"}, {"instruction": "I think so.  It helps for some things.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Do you think that Bill is trying to flaunt his new relationship in front of you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I think he probably just doesn't give a shit.  He never really seemed to care how I felt anyway.  At least he stopped caring after I agreed to be his girlfriend.", "input": "", "output": "Is Ethel Bill's girlfriend now?"}, {"instruction": "I hear that he is working on it.  But she is playing hard to get.  John told me that he saw the two of them in this bar and while Bill was going to the bathroom, Ethel picked up another guy and was hanging all over him when Bill came back.  John told me that he thought that Bill was really crushed when he saw it and just left right after that without saying a word to Ethel.", "input": "", "output": "Ethel doesn't sound very nice."}, {"instruction": "No, she's a bitch.  Everyone knows that.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think Bill is going out with her?"}, {"instruction": "He is a glutton for punishment?  No I just think he likes the chase.  He gets them and then quickly abandons them.  That's his pattern.  I sometimes think that if I just never really said yes to him, he would still be hanging around me like a sick puppy.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you would like?"}, {"instruction": "No.  That's why I said yes.  I was interested in a real relationship.  Not some kind of perverted love games.  In any case, it looks like he is in for it now.  I even heard that she has herpes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "She gets around.  Who knows?  Bill might end up with more than he bargained for.", "input": "", "output": "How did you hear that Ethel has herpes?"}, {"instruction": "SII might be a big company, but when everyone dates everyone else...well you know, there are no secrets.", "input": "", "output": "Are you hoping for Bill to get herpes?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe a little.", "input": "", "output": "Would you date him if you knew he had..."}, {"instruction": "No way!  I would have been completely disinterested in him if I knew he had VD.", "input": "", "output": "So if he catches it now, you would forever lose all interest in him?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I suppose so.  I never thought of it that way.  Now that's some really powerful positive imagery.  Thank you Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Well yes...shall we make the appointment for next week?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  Next Thursday at 4 pm?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. November 14th at 4 pm.  See you then, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye.  Have a good week."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  How are you doing this week?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know--there are ups and there are downs.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still thinking about Bill?"}, {"instruction": "I find it hard not to.  He is there all the time and it's very hard not to bump into him at work.", "input": "", "output": "That was true before but it seems to me that you managed to ignore him quite successfully."}, {"instruction": "He was busy on this project that we have all been working on for the last couple of months.  I even saw him sleep under his desk several times.  I told you before that at SII there is no such thing as a 9 to 5 job.  We all do these strange hours.  I bet sometimes it's worse than those sweat shops in Chinatown--we work longer hours and there is a lot more expected of us.", "input": "", "output": "But you enjoy it, don't you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes I do.  But some people can't take it and we have a high turnover in some positions.", "input": "", "output": "In the programming department?"}, {"instruction": "In our department there seems to be a core of regulars--the ones who've been with the company for many years.  And then there are the drifters--they come in for a project, burn out, and quit.", "input": "", "output": "So are you a regular?"}, {"instruction": "I'm getting there, although most of the regulars have been at SII for a lot longer than I.", "input": "", "output": "You were saying that Bill was working on this project..."}, {"instruction": "Yes he was.  So he turned into this hermit for the duration.  I guess when he finished, he decided to focus on his social life.  Now I see him everywhere.  He is having long lunches with the guys or with the new love of his life, he is hanging out in the programmer's lounge reading the latest, just everywhere I turn--there's Bill.  Or worse, it's the Bill and Ethel show.  How many places can you swap spit in public places?", "input": "", "output": "But Bill seems to be more..."}, {"instruction": "Of an idiot.", "input": "", "output": "As I remember you used to do the same things with Bill as he is doing with Ethel, isn't that true?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah but that was me.", "input": "", "output": "So what really bothers you is not Bill's current promiscuous behavior, but rather that he is doing it with someone else."}, {"instruction": "Of course that's what bothers me.  And I feel like he is flaunting his newfound happiness in front of my face.  I think it's just rotten.  And I know everyone is saying:  \"Oh that poor Anna, she must feel so terrible.  We know she used to love Bill.  They even talked about getting married.  But he dumped her.  And now she is all alone.\"  That's what everyone is thinking about.", "input": "", "output": "Are you more bothered by what you think people are thinking and saying about you than by your feelings of rejection and jealousy toward Bill?"}, {"instruction": "I think it's a mixture of these two.  Yeah, jealousy and rejection.  That sounds right.  You know people who talk about staying friends with the people they used to date.  Some even invite their ex's to their weddings and stuff.  I thinks it's just bullshit.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I mean that if you break up with someone, the last thing you really want is for them to be happy.  You can talk about how it just didn't work out between the two of you but you still respect and like each other as people but that's just total crap.  If you broke up with someone, chances are you don't really like them anymore.  I bet most of the time you hate their guts.  Face it, the last thing you want is for them to be happy.  Or worse, to be happy with someone else.  You want them to be miserable.  You want them to regret having lost you for the rest of their lives.  You want them on their death bed saying: \"Oh, if only I could have spent my life with her, it would have had meaning.\"", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you have some insight into human relations."}, {"instruction": "Come on.  I'm not the only one who thinks this way.  I'm just being honest, while most people like to pretend like they have these high moral standards and ideals that requires them to embrace the happiness of people who actually made them miserable.  I'm sure that deep down inside you agree with me too Doctor.  Your training might prohibit you from admitting it, but you know I'm right.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well imagine some old girlfriend calling you up out of the blue.  Now don't tell me that a chill of fear won't run through your body.  I bet you would be nervous through the whole conversation, right?", "input": "", "output": "Is that your reaction to old boyfriends?"}, {"instruction": "I get that reaction from just thinking about that call.", "input": "", "output": "So you don't believe that two people who have had a sexual relationship can ever be friends after that relationship is over?"}, {"instruction": "There's just no way.  It's clear that I can never be friends with Bill, for example.  The whole idea is just unthinkable.  And I'm sure he feels exactly the same way.", "input": "", "output": "But you started to date Bill because you found him interesting.  I assume that you felt the you had some common ground and you found each others company rewarding."}, {"instruction": "That's true.", "input": "", "output": "But you believe that it all changes after a sexual relationship has been consummated and then severed?"}, {"instruction": "Well let's see.  I find his company nerve-racking and unpleasant.  I think that if we had some common ground, it was all a delusion on my part.  And I think I would find him less than entertaining now.", "input": "", "output": "Well if all that is true, why care?  Why waste energy thinking about him?  You clearly don't want him back..."}, {"instruction": "Very clever Doctor.  But the problem is that while I don't like him and under no circumstances want him back, he still dominates my emotional landscape.  It's like a lot of dark energy is focused on him.  And when I see him walking my way, I feel uncomfortable.  I feel stressed and unhappy.  I feel nervous.  My stomach hurts.  And I feel like I just want to be transported someplace...anyplace else.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think this will change with time?"}, {"instruction": "I think I'm handling his new relationship with far greater ease now that I would have if he found her earlier.  But it's still hard.", "input": "", "output": "I can see that."}, {"instruction": "I wish I was seeing someone now.  It would make it easier to accept Bill's relationship.", "input": "", "output": "Are you looking for a long-term relationship?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  I'm still young and I think that if I found that special someone right now, I would blow it.  I still need some time to try things out and learn before committing.", "input": "", "output": "What do you need to learn?"}, {"instruction": "I felt really unsure of myself when I was with Bill.  I let him dominate me.  But that's wrong.  I suspect that even if Bill didn't act like such an asshole about the whole pregnancy thing, it still wouldn't have worked between us.  There would have been some other issue down the road.", "input": "", "output": "I think that's an important insight, Anna.  I see you've been thinking a lot about this."}, {"instruction": "I have.  In some ways it's a real blessing that Bill showed his true colors relatively early in our relationship.  Some people don't find out until much much later and by then they might have children already and a bunch of other responsibilities.  Take Ms. Bows for example.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "She is about to have a kid and she is clearly having some marital difficulties.  Now if only she found out earlier, she might not have ended up being a single mom.  I feel really sorry for her.  I'm glad it didn't happen to me.  And I want to do all I can to keep it from happening.", "input": "", "output": "How do you plan to do that?"}, {"instruction": "Bill was a good learning experience.  And everything that happened to me since has probably been good for me too.  Even though it hurt a lot, it was good for me.  You know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "You feel like you are gaining experience and learning how to make a future relationship work?"}, {"instruction": "Exactly.", "input": "", "output": "What about stories that you told me which turned out not to be true?"}, {"instruction": "I feel like they are true.", "input": "", "output": "But they are not, are they?  You made them up for my benefit."}, {"instruction": "I wish you wouldn't bring that up Doctor.  Don't you think I've been showing a lot of progress during this session?", "input": "", "output": "Yes I can see you've been doing a lot of thinking since our last session."}, {"instruction": "Yes I have.  And I want you to recognize it and praise me for it.  Instead you are bringing up something unpleasant.", "input": "", "output": "I do recognize your self-examination and I think you do deserve to be praised for it."}, {"instruction": "That's better Doctor.  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "We didn't get a chance to talk about the good things that happened to you this week.  Do you want to tell me briefly what they were or do you want to save it for next session?"}, {"instruction": "I think I entertained you enough this week.  I'll save the good parts for next time.  Maybe you'll get lucky and I'll have something exciting to tell you.", "input": "", "output": "I'll just have to wait."}, {"instruction": "Yes you do.  Now do you want me at the same time next Thursday?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  November 21st at 4 pm."}, {"instruction": "It's nice to be wanted Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next time Anna."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  You have to excuse me.  I think I'm getting sick.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  You do look a bit pale.  Do you think it's flu?"}, {"instruction": "No, I got a flu shot this year.  I think it's just a cold.  With the recent rainy weather it's not that surprising.  Actually a lot of people in my department are either sick or about to come down with something.  And all just in time for Thanksgiving.  It will be a lovely holiday--the whole family will get together to exchange germs.", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to see your parents for Thanksgiving?"}, {"instruction": "Well aren't you?  You really should Doctor.  There are a few days a year that we all should spend time with our family and Thanksgiving is one of them.", "input": "", "output": "Actually I am flying to New York to see my parents and sister over the long weekend."}, {"instruction": "Good for you.  I'll try not to sneeze in your direction, although you'll probably catch something on the plane anyway.", "input": "", "output": "I appreciate your efforts Anna."}, {"instruction": "You know it's just amazing the kind of cost cutting measures the airplanes take.  I heard that it would only cost fifty cents more per passenger to fully vent the airplane instead of recycling the air during the flight.  I'd be willing to pay an extra fifty cents on my ticket to get fresh air on the plane.  I always get sick when I fly and I think it's because the airlines are trying to save a few bucks.", "input": "", "output": "It's a good point."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So how was your week?  Last time you left me wondering about something wonderful that was happening to you.  Do you want to talk about it today?"}, {"instruction": "Why Doctor?  Do you want to know if you should feel jealous?  You know you have nothing to worry about--my heart still belongs to you.", "input": "", "output": "From the note in your voice it sounds like the rest of you doesn't."}, {"instruction": "You mean like my fingers and toes and...well you might have something to worry about Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "So what's his name?"}, {"instruction": "John.  John Riley.", "input": "", "output": "Is he from SII?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.  I told you that we prefer incest to outside relationships.  In fact I might have talked to you about him.", "input": "", "output": "I'm embarrassed to say that I don't think I remember who he is."}, {"instruction": "That's okay Doctor.  It was only a small reference.  He's also a programmer.  We even worked on a couple of projects together.", "input": "", "output": "Is he the guy who got hurt during the baseball game?"}, {"instruction": "Very good Doctor.  I'm very impressed.  I should remember that you have a long memory and nothing gets by you.  You know with skills like that you might be better employed as a spy, a CIA operative or something, instead of being a therapist.  A Johnny Mnemonic kind of guy.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, I think."}, {"instruction": "Oh, it was definitely meant as a compliment Doctor.  I'm just amazed that you could remember a name that I mentioned in passing several months ago.", "input": "", "output": "John Riley.  Do you want to talk about him?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  I want to ignite the passions of jealousy in your soul Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "That's okay.  I'll settle for curiosity for now.  Let's see.  John is also one of the regulars in our department.  I think he's been with the company for about eight years.  He started there right after he dropped out of college.  Some of the smartest people I know dropped out, so don't judge him by that.", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't going to."}, {"instruction": "So he is very smart and a good programmer.  Probably better than me.  At least in some areas.  He is a bit...how should I put it?  Clumsy?  Uncoordinated?  Accident prone?  It's just that he is constantly thinking and usually not about where he is going.  He managed to knock over the entire coffee station on our floor.  Luckily no one got hurt.  I think that absent-minded genius is a good way of thinking about John.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like a very kind description."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  Most people just call them clods.  But we've been friends now for about two and a half years--as long as I worked for SII.  He is a really good guy even though he is not very good in social situations.", "input": "", "output": "Socially challenged?"}, {"instruction": "Very funny Doctor.  But that's a good label for John.  I should mention it to him.  He would like it.  So as I was saying, we were friends for quite some time.  In fact he was one of the people who were trying to warn me about Bill when we first got involved.", "input": "", "output": "John was the guy who you said had a crush on you for a long time so you couldn't take his warnings seriously."}, {"instruction": "That's right.  I wished I listened to him though.  It would figure that if the guy likes you, he would have your best interests in mind.  John was just trying to protect me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He was.  Bill was bad for me.  He hurt me and I'm still trying to recover from our relationship.  But back to John.  We all went out to see Vertigo.  It's been restored and it's playing in the City.  In fact you should go see it Doctor.  It's a very good movie and who knows when it would be showing on the big screen next.", "input": "", "output": "I do like that movie and I've already gone to see the restored version."}, {"instruction": "Wow Doctor.  I didn't know you have a social life.", "input": "", "output": "I saw it alone."}, {"instruction": "It figures--you keep turning me down and I'm a very good date.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you are.  So John went to see Vertigo with you?"}, {"instruction": "John and a bunch of other people.  But John managed to maneuver to sit next to me during the movie.  It was very sweet.  He reached out and held my hand.  I could tell that he was very nervous and it took a lot of courage on his part.  After the movie, he offered to walk me home.  He held my hand all the way.  I don't know why I never really noticed it before, but John is kind of cute.  He is tall and thin.  He has a very nice hair even though there are definite signs of balding on the top.  And he has very beautiful eyes--like soft chocolate with twinkles.  We talked about the movie.  Apparently John is a San Francisco buff.  He told me about different San Francisco locations that the movie was shot at.  You know some things haven't changed at all?  They still look the way they did in the fifties when the movie was made.  John offered to give me a Vertigo tour of San Francisco.", "input": "", "output": "Did you go?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  John and I spent Saturday together walking around town.  We went to the Palace of the Legion of Honor, and to the Palace of Fine Arts, and to the base of the Golden Gate Bridge, we even got to Mission Dolores.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a full day."}, {"instruction": "We had a great time Doctor.  I wish that I'd done it before.", "input": "", "output": "You mean spend the day with John?"}, {"instruction": "We've been friends for a long time but I feel like I never really knew him.", "input": "", "output": "That happens sometimes.  Are you more than friends now?"}, {"instruction": "We are not sleeping together if that's what you're asking.", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't.  I wanted to know if you were romantically involved with John now."}, {"instruction": "Let's just say that we are more than just friends now.  We don't want to rush things.  So far we've only kissed three times.  We both had bad experiences in the past and want to take things slow.", "input": "", "output": "That seems like good approach."}, {"instruction": "I think so.  And it's not like I'm not interested in making love to John.  Or he to me.  We talked about physical attraction and how it's not the same as being in love with someone.  I think that if we wait awhile, we would have a better foundation for a good relationship.  Not to mention that anticipation is half the fun.  Don't you think Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you are working on establishing a broad base for your relationship with John."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  It makes me happy thinking about him.  I really look forward going to work now.  And even seeing Bill and Ethel doesn't bother me as much now--there is no way their relationship is going to last.  All they do when they are together is eat face.  John and I talk.  We are trying to learn about each other.", "input": "", "output": "That's definitely good."}, {"instruction": "Remember what I told you about past boyfriends last time?", "input": "", "output": "You talked about how it was fundamentally impossible to remain friends with someone after your relationship had turned sexual."}, {"instruction": "That's right.  And I still think that it's basically true--when you sleep with someone you can kiss friendship goodbye.  But somehow with John I think it might be different.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "It's not all about sex with him.  He really wants to spend time with me.  I think that if I was in a bad accident and paralyzed from the neck down, John would still want to be with me.  So I think it just might be possible that we could remain friends even after we consummate our relationship.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And for now I just want to wait anyway and to limit our physical contact to oral activities.  And I mean kissing Doctor.  I saw the way you looked at me just now.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Bill once told me that I have a very sensuous mouth and that every man who looks at me thinks of the same thing.  And I saw the way you looked at my mouth Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Anna our time is up.  Next week is Thanksgiving and I will be out of town from Wednesday to Sunday night.  Would you like to reschedule our session for Wednesday morning or would you like to just skip one week and meet on Thursday two weeks from today?"}, {"instruction": "I'm driving up to Davis to see my parents on Wednesday.  I'd like to beat traffic and leave kind of early.  I don't know, I guess I'll skip a week.  Is that okay?", "input": "", "output": "That's fine."}, {"instruction": "It'll be weird not seeing you for so long Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I think you'll be fine.  And you can always call me if something comes up."}, {"instruction": "That's true.  Well have a happy Thanksgiving.  Say hi to your parents and sister.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you very much.  And I hope you'll have a good Thanksgiving too Anna.  I'll see you in two weeks.  That's the fifth of December at 5 o'clock.   Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Now I'm all nervous about this.  Maybe I can come in just for a little bit on Wednesday morning?", "input": "", "output": "You'll be fine Anna.  Really.  Go home.  Have fun with John."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I'm seeing him tonight.  Okay than, goodbye Doctor.  I'll call you if...", "input": "", "output": "No problem.  I'll be happy to hear from you.  Goodbye Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  It's really nice to see you.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  It's nice to see you too.  Frankly I thought I would see or hear from you before our regular session."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry to worry you Doctor.  I don't know what came over me.  I was so anxious when you were gone.  I really tried not calling you.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay.  I don't mind you calling me when you're feeling like you need to talk to me.  I'm just surprised that you didn't come in for a visit on Monday."}, {"instruction": "Oh that.  I told you that I just started to feel bad when I knew you were out of town.  When I called your answering service on Sunday, they gave me a local number--so I knew you were back.  I hate to admit it, but I called your answering service more than once.  And on Monday I watched you come into the building.  And then I saw you in your office through your window a couple of times.", "input": "", "output": "So you've been checking up on me?"}, {"instruction": "Well...just a little.", "input": "", "output": "So once you knew that I was back in town, your anxiety went away?"}, {"instruction": "Basically.", "input": "", "output": "Did it go away completely?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it made me feel better to know where you were.  I liked seeing you in your office.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So how was your Thanksgiving Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "It was very nice.  Thank you."}, {"instruction": "Are you going to go away for Christmas?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure yet."}, {"instruction": "Oh.", "input": "", "output": "Does it make you feel anxious to think about?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I really hated it.  You being away, I mean.  I had a really horrible Thanksgiving.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that."}, {"instruction": "Thank goodness I was sick.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "My parents just thought that I had a bad cold and wasn't feeling well.  Imagine if they found out about you?  My mom would just assume that I'm heading straight for a happy farm.  Not that there is something wrong with the mental hospitals--I just meant that my mom would really freak out.", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  So you don't want your parents to know that you're seeing a psychiatrist."}, {"instruction": "Why should I scare them?  What they don't know couldn't hurt them.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It's not bad Doctor.  I'm just protecting them.", "input": "", "output": "Do you ever talk to your parents about how you feel and what's going on in your life?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes.  But it's never like between you and me.  I could never talk to my parents about sex, for example.  I swear my mom probably thinks that I'm still a virgin.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever try talking to your parents about sex?"}, {"instruction": "When I was very young and curious about what was down there.  But they always reacted so strongly.  I think I told you about some of my attempts at communication with them.", "input": "", "output": "Seeing your grandfather naked in the shower..."}, {"instruction": "For example.  It was not a big deal, but they made it so that I remember the incident for the rest of my life.", "input": "", "output": "Do you ever talk to your parents about your relationships?"}, {"instruction": "They are curious.  But I try to keep it to myself mostly.  Again, what they don't know couldn't hurt them.  And it's not that hard not talking to them about this--we live far enough away that they are well insulated from my day-to-day life.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure your parents need that much protection?  Maybe if you gave them a chance, they would be happy to be more involved with your life."}, {"instruction": "My mom would love to get more involved.  But it's just not for me Doctor.  I find our relationship much more satisfying in that way.  I feel I could be open with you.  I know that if I say something controversial to you, it won't come back to me in the form of an accusation later.  I'll save my parents for the time I have children.  Then we can talk about how horrible their grandchildren are and we all can stay happy and friendly.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I think most parents don't really want to know that much about their grown children.  They say they do.  But in reality they are happy being in the dark with their own illusions and fantasies.  Do you talk to your parents Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes."}, {"instruction": "That's what I thought.  I bet you didn't tell them about me, did you?", "input": "", "output": "I don't discuss my patients."}, {"instruction": "Even the ones that are so in love with you that they freak out when you are away and track you down at your parents' house?", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "Your mom didn't ask who was the lunatic who called you all the way from San Francisco?", "input": "", "output": "My mom knows better."}, {"instruction": "Well trained, I see.", "input": "", "output": "How about we talk about John.  Did you see him last week?"}, {"instruction": "I saw him only on Monday.  He also went to see his parents in Arizona.  He left the same day I did and didn't come back until late Sunday night.  But he did call me a few times and left me messages on my answering machine--so he cares.", "input": "", "output": "Is your relationship going well?"}, {"instruction": "He says that he really likes me.  He told me that he told his parents about me.  He comes to visit me several times a day.  He calls me at night to wish me sweet dreams.  He's just around all the time.", "input": "", "output": "During our last session you told me that you really liked him and enjoyed spending time with him.  Did that change?"}, {"instruction": "What makes you think it changed Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "The way you were just talking about John was...let's say you didn't sound very enthusiastic."}, {"instruction": "I just had a rough week.  It's not John.  In fact he is just fine.  And sometimes it's nice to have someone who is really trying to impress you and be with you.  It's nice to be pursued, don't you think Doctor?  Doesn't it makes you feel good that I'm so willing and eager to be with you?  Just a little maybe?", "input": "", "output": "I want you to have productive relationships with people that..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah.  I heard all that.  But it's not what I asked.  Does it make you feel good that I want you Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I have mixed feelings about that.  But mainly I feel like I'm not helping you as much as I would like to.  I want you to be happy with who you are and with your life.  Your desires for me do not contribute to your happiness and..."}, {"instruction": "That's very nice Doctor.  I'm glad I can make you happy.  I do want you and I do think about you and I'm glad you can appreciate it.", "input": "", "output": "Let's talk more about John."}, {"instruction": "If that would make you happy Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think this could develop into a serious relationship?  Or do you think of John as a short term distraction--somebody to go out with and be with until you find something better?"}, {"instruction": "That's sounds very cold.  I do like John.  We've been friends for a very long time.  I wouldn't want to do anything that hurt him, Doctor.  But as of right now, I cannot say that he is the man that I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I just don't know yet.  We need to spend a lot more time together before I can even begin to think about things like that.", "input": "", "output": "How long was it before you knew Bill was someone you would consider marrying?"}, {"instruction": "That was different.  There was more passion there.  Bill and I were a lot more sexually attracted to each other.  But a relationship cannot be based on sex alone.  Bill and I were clearly wrong for each other.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel any sexual attraction to John?"}, {"instruction": "I told you that we kissed a few times.", "input": "", "output": "Three as I recall."}, {"instruction": "It's five now.", "input": "", "output": "Is John someone you want to have sex with?  Eventually?"}, {"instruction": "I know he wants to have sex with me.", "input": "", "output": "Somehow I didn't doubt that.  But what about you?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe if I think of you as I make love to him, it could work.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Just kidding Doctor.  I don't know yet.  When I imagine John naked it just...let's just say he does not inspire me in that way.  Yet.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "You do.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, we talked about this before.  You have to..."}, {"instruction": "Relax Doctor.  I'll control myself.  It's just that this last weekend, or week, I've been thinking about you a lot.  And sometimes I just...well...sometimes I thought about you in that way.  I even had some dreams where you made me...you made me have an orgasm in my dreams.  Don't look at me like that Doctor.  I can handle it.  Now that you are here, I don't have to think about you as much.  It will get back to normal, you'll see.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "Let's schedule our next session Anna."}, {"instruction": "Same time next week?", "input": "", "output": "Next Thursday at 4 pm.  I'll see you then."}, {"instruction": "Have a good weekend Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you Anna.  You too.  Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye Doctor.  Please don't be angry with me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not angry with you."}, {"instruction": "Really?", "input": "", "output": "Really.  I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  How are you?", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  I'm doing well.  And you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm doing really well.  Thank you for asking Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "That's good.  Would you like to talk about that?"}, {"instruction": "Anything to make you happy Doctor.  Let's see, after I saw you last I went straight home, had some dinner--all alone mind you--and went to bed also all alone.  The next day I went to SII, worked for three hours, went to lunch, and then worked for six more hours, and then went home.  Ate some dinner and went to bed.  Then on Saturday I slept in late, woke up, took a shower, had some coffee...", "input": "", "output": "I don't think I need this level of detail.  I'm getting a feeling that something in particular happened last week.  Would you like to talk about that?"}, {"instruction": "I just wanted to give you a feeling that I'm not a social butterfly.  I'm a real person who basically spends most of her time working.", "input": "", "output": "I know that Anna."}, {"instruction": "Good.  I just wanted to make sure that you do.", "input": "", "output": "So what happened last week?"}, {"instruction": "Well I didn't see John the whole weekend and he was very upset with me and questioned me about losing interest in him.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.  He's a nice guy and all.  I like spending time with him.  He is great to go to the movies with or to just walk around town doing nothing in particular.  We have fun conversations.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "I'm just not really attracted to him in the way he is attracted to me.  I thought if I gave it some time, I would start to feel differently.  But it hasn't really happened.  Now when I see John, I feel guilty.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I know that he wants to hug me and to kiss me, but the thought of that makes me very uncomfortable.  I really don't want him touching me like that.", "input": "", "output": "Do you let him?"}, {"instruction": "I grin and bear it.", "input": "", "output": "I thought we talked about this before--Anna Green has a right to refuse any unwanted touching at any time even if it will result in hurting someone's feelings.  Remember?"}, {"instruction": "I do.  But I feel responsible.  I led him on and now he is so happy.  It doesn't really hurt anything and it's not like I'm completely disgusted by his touch.  I just don't want to let it go too far.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you need to have a talk with John.  Don't you think it would be only fair to let him know how you really feel?  You might hurt him a lot more in the long run if you don't."}, {"instruction": "You're right of course Doctor.  But--this is going to sound really selfish--on some level I enjoy having John run around after me, you know?  Before I always had to do all the pursuing.  I'd just like to experience it the other way around for just a bit longer.", "input": "", "output": "Well, what about Bill?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "You told me that in the beginning Bill was the one to go after you, remember?"}, {"instruction": "That's true.  But that didn't last too long.  With Bill, as soon as I said yes it was all over. Then I had to do all the work.", "input": "", "output": "What about David?"}, {"instruction": "That was just a one night...evening stand.  It doesn't really count.", "input": "", "output": "What about the guy in LA?  He came after you.  He even tried to pursue the relationship long distance."}, {"instruction": "For a couple of hours until he found Miss \"Love of His Life\" and dropped me like yesterday's trash.", "input": "", "output": "So what you really like about John's attentions is their constancy?"}, {"instruction": "For once in my life there is this guy who really wants me and wants me not for a day or a week but for the rest of his life.  And the sad part is I just don't feel it.  I'm going to blow it.  And I even like him as a friend and everything.  But hard as I try I just don't feel more.", "input": "", "output": "You can't force yourself to love someone Anna.  The chemistry either happens or it doesn't.  You can't will it to happen."}, {"instruction": "I guess.  It's just a shame that's all.  Here I have all the chemistry in the world that one would need but it's all for you.  You can just look at me and I feel...", "input": "", "output": "Anna you know..."}, {"instruction": "...wet and hot.", "input": "", "output": "Anna you know it can't happen between the two of us no matter how much chemistry there might be between us.  One of the goals of our sessions is to refocus this energy on other people.  If John is not the one, that's okay.  There will be others."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I agree with everything you're saying.  But I still think about you all the time. I even...oh you're going to hate this.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "When John tries to hug me I imagine that it's you and not John.  And when I do I can feel myself melting in his arms.  I see your face in place of John's and I begin to burn with desire.  And poor John thinks it's all because of him.", "input": "", "output": "I see how it might be difficult for John to believe that you are not interested in him."}, {"instruction": "I know I'm using him.  But I won't take it any further Doctor.  You don't have to worry.", "input": "", "output": "You mean you're going to talk to him?"}, {"instruction": "No not yet.  But I will not sleep with him pretending it's you.", "input": "", "output": "Well that's a relief."}, {"instruction": "I mean I won't make love to him.", "input": "", "output": "I understood."}, {"instruction": "I slept with him already.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "He came over to watch a movie one evening and I let him stay over and sleep with me in my bed.  But he promised me that he wouldn't try to do anything.  And he behaved like a perfect gentleman.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "I wasn't very good.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I knew John wouldn't touch me if he promised me not to.  So I decided to sleep in the nude.", "input": "", "output": "Just to torture him?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure he enjoyed it.  And if given the choice of me sleeping in pajamas or wearing nothing at all, he would have chosen the latter.  Don't you think Doctor?  I hope it would have been your choice.", "input": "", "output": "Did he sleep in the nude too?"}, {"instruction": "I wouldn't let him.  But I could still see that he was very interested in me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I know it was kind of bad of me.  But on the other hand I want to keep his fantasy life exciting and vivid.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I dreamt about you that night.  I pretended that it was you in bed with me.  If we didn't touch, we wouldn't have broken any of your silly psychiatric rules about doctors and patients.  Don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "I believe that..."}, {"instruction": "For example if I were to take off my blouse right now--let's pretend that I have this irresistible impulse to get naked--you wouldn't be breaking any rules would you?  You just have a very sick patient in your office, that's all.  Some of your patients twitch, some have multiple personalities, and some want to be naked.", "input": "", "output": "That's a very interesting and creative solution Anna.  But we both know that that would be just a pretend desire and not a real one.  So please..."}, {"instruction": "Oh I wouldn't be pretending Doctor.  I want to be naked around you.  I want you to see me and to touch...", "input": "", "output": "Anna you are going too far.  Please put your blouse back on.  Right now!"}, {"instruction": "But Doctor!  I haven't taken off my pants yet.", "input": "", "output": "I think we should end our session early today."}, {"instruction": "Don't you think I look nice?", "input": "", "output": "Please stop Anna.  This is really insane."}, {"instruction": "That's why I need you Doctor.  I can't help myself.", "input": "", "output": "Yes you can."}, {"instruction": "Here, look at me all over.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, step away from the window!"}, {"instruction": "I don't mind if they see me--you're a Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Put your clothes back on right now."}, {"instruction": "Oh Doctor.  Don't you have the teeniest bit of desire towards me?", "input": "", "output": "Now Anna.  I won't play this game with you."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, you must be able to see how much I want you.", "input": "", "output": "It's irrelevant.  Put the clothes on now.  I must insist."}, {"instruction": "It's relevant to me.  Oh all right.  But you weren't really offended; I could tell.  You can't be completely immune to a naked woman throwing herself at you.", "input": "", "output": "The shirt too.  I hope that you will think about what you have done just now and realize just how inappropriate your behavior has been."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry Doctor.  I'll be thinking about it.  I don't think I'll be able to think about anything else.", "input": "", "output": "Our session's over Anna.  I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "I'll be here.  Goodbye Doctor.  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Anna."}, {"instruction": "Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  Please come in and sit down.  We have to have a serious talk."}, {"instruction": "I know.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  What happened last time in this office can never happen again.  Do you understand?"}, {"instruction": "Yes Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "This is your last warning Anna.  If you try to manipulate me again, I will have to discontinue our relationship.  Is that clear?"}, {"instruction": "You really think I'm a terrible person, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "I didn't say that.  But what you did last time was outrageous.  It will not happen again."}, {"instruction": "You hate me.", "input": "", "output": "I don't hate you.  But I hate being manipulated."}, {"instruction": "I just wanted...I just wanted...", "input": "", "output": "Please don't cry Anna.  I know what you wanted.  But it's not meant to be.  If our relationship is to continue, we'll have to find a way to..."}, {"instruction": "I just wanted you to know how much you meant to me.  I've never ever done anything like that before.  I don't even know how I got the nerve to do it in the first place.  It was as if I was in a daze.  I knew what was happening but it was as if I was watching the whole thing on TV or something.  I could watch but I couldn't control the action.", "input": "", "output": "Couldn't?"}, {"instruction": "It was as if there were two of me--one was my normal self.  That's the one who was doing all the watching.  And the other was this...this exhibitionist.  I mean I know it was all me.  But at the same time it wasn't.  My fingers were unbuttoning my blouse and taking off my jeans but I had no control over them.  I felt like a deer caught in the headlights; I knew the car was coming and it was going to hit me, but I couldn't move out of its way.  And then I was naked and you were looking at me.  Part of me just wanted to run and hide and die of embarrassment.  But there was also this high--I felt exuberant.  My heart was beating so fast I thought it might explode out my chest.  I felt dizzy and strange.  And I felt the most unbelievable desire.  It was as if I was on fire.  I wanted you so much that it hurt.  I don't even remember what I was saying to you Doctor.  I was just talking to keep myself from...I never felt anything like this before in my life.  I never knew it was possible to feel this way--a sexual high.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Now I know how it could be.  Now I know.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad it was an enlightening experience for you.  But do you see that it was wrong?"}, {"instruction": "I know it was.  I really really do.  And I'm sorry for putting you through it Doctor.  But I'm not sorry it happened.", "input": "", "output": "You are not sorry..."}, {"instruction": "I thought that I would never be able to face you after what happened.", "input": "", "output": "But you somehow found a way?"}, {"instruction": "If it was anybody else, I would run to the ends of the Earth to get away, to never have to face them...him again.  But you make it easy.", "input": "", "output": "I do?"}, {"instruction": "You make me feel like it is okay for me do be me.  You see?", "input": "", "output": "No.  And it wasn't okay."}, {"instruction": "No, that's not what I mean.  You accept me just the way I am.  You don't judge me.  You always want to help me.  You listen to me and you hear what I'm saying to you.  You understand me.  I knew it would be okay to come to you today.", "input": "", "output": "I don't approve of what you've done."}, {"instruction": "That's okay.  No, it's good that you don't.  I did something terrible.", "input": "", "output": "So you realize that It was bad?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I know I was bad.  But I also know that you will try to help me.  You will not use my bad behavior against me.  You understand.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "You'll nurture me and help me develop emotionally and mature socially.", "input": "", "output": "That's certainly my goal."}, {"instruction": "And I know you'll help me to explore and understand my sexuality too.", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "When I was standing naked in front of you and burning with desire for you, I felt like all my senses were reaching their highest levels of sensitivity, the highest levels of intensity.  I could feel your eyes on my body as if you were reaching out and touching me.", "input": "", "output": "I don't..."}, {"instruction": "I was in ecstasy.  You were five feet away from me.  But I could feel you with my entire body.  It was as if there was an electric field all around you and I was bathing in it.  I could feel you with every cell in body.  All my neurons were buzzing with excitement.  I think if you actually touched me I would have lost consciousness from the perceptual overload.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "I never felt this way before.

I feel more sensual.  I feel like there is an energy about me that make people look up and take notice.  I feel stronger.

I'm very grateful to you for that Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever stop to think why you felt that way?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?  I felt like that because of you.  Because of how you make me feel.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think I make you feel that way?"}, {"instruction": "Because I love you.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure that the feeling of excitement you've described in such detail, occurred because of me and not due to the fact that you enjoyed the feeling of danger?  The feeling of excitement from exposing yourself in public?  You stood right in front of the window.  Anyone from SII who happen to have looked out at that moment could have seen you.  And there were people just outside my office door.  What if someone walked in?"}, {"instruction": "Are you saying that I felt the excitement because of the danger?  The danger of being exposed in public?", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "No!  It was you.", "input": "", "output": "Remember you described having oral sex in a stadium?  You said it was exciting.  Was it exciting because of Bill or because you were out in the open?  Anyone could have watched you.  And what about going skinny dipping in the lake after hours?  You were worrying about being caught by the rangers.  Remember?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Did the feeling of excitement that you felt then similar to what happened here during last time?"}, {"instruction": "That was different.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "That was just...but here last time was...it was different.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure?  Maybe what you're experiencing is the thrill--the danger of possibly being caught."}, {"instruction": "No.  That's sick!  Why would I want to get caught?", "input": "", "output": "Not actually caught, but the possibility of getting caught."}, {"instruction": "No!  Definitely not.  It was you Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I thought about it all week.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "Well, don't you think that if getting naked in public was what got me off, I would have simply go out and do it?  Why would I want or need you?", "input": "", "output": "Good question.  Why don't we stop here for today and you'll go home and think about it over the holidays."}, {"instruction": "Are you going away?", "input": "", "output": "No, I'm staying in San Francisco."}, {"instruction": "Oh good.

You too Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks.  Goodbye Anna."}, {"instruction": "Doctor?  May I come in?", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  Sure.  You're a bit early today.  What's up?"}, {"instruction": "I just drove down from my parents.", "input": "", "output": "From Davis?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Were you spending Christmas with them?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.

Is that okay?", "input": "", "output": "It's okay today."}, {"instruction": "That's great Doctor.  Thank you very much.", "input": "", "output": "So how was Christmas with your family?"}, {"instruction": "It was good.  I told you that my mother is a good cook.

You would like it.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure I would."}, {"instruction": "My mother always makes the same meal for all the holidays--Christmas and Easter and Thanksgiving of course.", "input": "", "output": "Always turkey?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But the desert is different.  It's pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, and plum pudding for Christmas, and some chocolates for Easter.", "input": "", "output": "How traditional."}, {"instruction": "I guess.  But it's good.", "input": "", "output": "So the food was very good.  And how were your parents?"}, {"instruction": "They are the same.  They want to know all about me--what projects am I working on at SII? Do I eat okay? What movies do I see? How is Caren? Is there anything new in the city?--If you notice the pattern it's all leading up to my social life.", "input": "", "output": "I noticed.  Do your parents know Caren?"}, {"instruction": "Caren and my mom are buddies.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Every time they come down to see me, my mother wants me to invite Caren over.  She even talks to her on the phone on a regular basis.  Sometimes I feel like Caren is my mom's inside man.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well what else do they talk about?  All my mom is really interested in is about me and my life.  And Caren is able to come up with information about me that I might not necessarily volunteer.", "input": "", "output": "Are you upset with Caren because she talks to your mom?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I have an understanding with Caren--she doesn't tell my mom and I don't tell her's.", "input": "", "output": "You know Caren's parents?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  We've been friends forever.", "input": "", "output": "How are you getting along with Caren?"}, {"instruction": "Just fine.  No problems.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "So my parents wanted me to tell them about the guy that I'm dating.", "input": "", "output": "You told them about John?"}, {"instruction": "Well not really.  We haven't seen each other lately.  He went to see his parents over the holidays--some big family reunion or something.  And I was busy.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still going out?"}, {"instruction": "He thinks so.", "input": "", "output": "And you?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't think the holidays were a good time to break the news to him.", "input": "", "output": "You're planning on breaking up with him?"}, {"instruction": "Frankly I was hoping he'd figure it out himself.  But the man is dense, so I will have to do the damage manually.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds mean."}, {"instruction": "I gave him tons of opportunities to break my heart but he just wouldn't take them.  I wanted him to break up with me.  I figured that I didn't care either way and his ego might have fared better if he initiated the break up.

So my parents wanted to know who I was dating.", "input": "", "output": "You said that."}, {"instruction": "Yes I did.", "input": "", "output": "What did you tell them?"}, {"instruction": "I said that I wasn't really dating anyone but I did like somebody a lot.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I told them that he was very handsome and extremely intelligent.

And I said that I hoped that he thought that I was beautiful as well.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "My dad said that if this guy hadn't noticed how good looking I am yet then he's blind.  My mom wanted to know if we'd gone out on a date yet.", "input": "", "output": "What did you tell her?"}, {"instruction": "I said that we'd never been on a formal date yet.  And that we'd never even kissed.  But...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "But that he saw me naked by accident.

You wouldn't want me to lie would you?", "input": "", "output": "Lie?  What do you call telling you parents..."}, {"instruction": "I was just telling them about a man that I thought was perfect for me.  I was telling them about the man that I love.  I was telling them about the most important thing that was going on in my life right now.  What should have I told them Doctor?  Should I have told them about John?  He is a nothing.  He is completely irrelevant to my life.  Why should I waste their time on him?", "input": "", "output": "You didn't tell them that the man you were describing is your psychiatrist, did you?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't tell them what you did for a living.", "input": "", "output": "It's a bit more than that, don't you think?  You didn't tell them about our true relationship--that of a doctor and a patient."}, {"instruction": "Should I have upset my mother on her favorite holiday?  My grandmother was there.  She's eighty seven.  Should I have told her that her only granddaughter is crazy?  She was raised and accustomed to a different set of judgments and has a different point of view on life.  She would never understand seeing a psychiatrist for reasons other than a total nervous breakdown.  If I just mentioned that I'd seen a therapist some time in the past, she'd have a heart attack.  Is that what you want Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Anna, you know..."}, {"instruction": "Yes I know.  That's why I didn't really tell them anything.  I never mentioned your name.  I never mentioned what you do.

Happy New Year to you too."}, {"instruction": "Thank you very much.  I'm hoping for a really great one.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you get your wish.  Did you go out and celebrate on Tuesday?"}, {"instruction": "I wanted to.", "input": "", "output": "But?  I hear a \"but.\""}, {"instruction": "At the last minute John showed up.  He claimed that we had a date.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't think so.", "input": "", "output": "But John did?"}, {"instruction": "He said that we made it months ago.", "input": "", "output": "You've only been going out for a few weeks."}, {"instruction": "Precisely.  But he insisted that we did and...I just didn't want to argue about that.  If he wanted to tag along that was fine.", "input": "", "output": "Were you planning on meeting any friends?"}, {"instruction": "Just Caren and her boyfriend.  Although they had someone in mind for me to meet that night.  But oh well.", "input": "", "output": "That was very nice of you."}, {"instruction": "Letting John come along and wasting an opportunity?", "input": "", "output": "Sort of."}, {"instruction": "I wasn't particularly interested in meeting anyone.  I basically just wanted someone to dance with.", "input": "", "output": "So John was your dancing partner for New Year's Night?"}, {"instruction": "I wish it went that well.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Oh John was feeling needy and was all weird.  He totally ruined my evening.", "input": "", "output": "What did he do?"}, {"instruction": "What didn't he do?  First he was all strange and jumpy when he showed up in my apartment completely unannounced.  He was lucky that I didn't have a guy there or something.  I could just see how that would have played out.  But I was just getting ready to meet Caren--they were going to buzz me, and we were going in their car.  If I was just a little bit luckier I would have completely missed him.", "input": "", "output": "Instead you spend the evening with Mr. \"completely irrelevant to my life.\""}, {"instruction": "You remembered that?", "input": "", "output": "You made a point of just how little John means to you."}, {"instruction": "I guess I did.  But I just want you to notice that I didn't simply throw him out.  I let him come along with us and make our New Year's Eve a total hell.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure Caren and her boyfriend were grateful to you for that."}, {"instruction": "They told me that I owe them big.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "In any case, John showed up just as I was putting on my make-up.  I let him in and he just stood there and watched me.  Made me really uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "It was as if he was judging me or something.", "input": "", "output": "Your make-up?"}, {"instruction": "Everything--the way my hair was, my dress, my shoes...just everything.  I thought that I looked particularly good that night.  Since I started thinking about you a lot, I lost a ton of weight.", "input": "", "output": "How much?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not exactly sure.  About fifteen pounds or so.", "input": "", "output": "That's a lot."}, {"instruction": "But you think I look good?  You had a good opportunity to observe the distribution of weight on my body recently.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Don't freak out Doctor.  I'm not planning on talking about that.  I'm telling you about John.  So that evening I was wearing this really short black dress.  Nothing fancy really, just a small cloth of Lycra.", "input": "", "output": "But large enough not to get you arrested, right?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor!  I'm shocked.  Shocked, I tell you.  But yes, large enough not to be arrested.  But small enough to require matching underwear.  Don't look at me that way.  In the fifties and sixties, women commonly wore underwear that matched their outfits.", "input": "", "output": "So John didn't approve of your dress?"}, {"instruction": "He didn't say anything.  He just looked at...stared at me.  But I wasn't asking for his opinion and Caren thought it was very nice.", "input": "", "output": "And her boyfriend?"}, {"instruction": "I think he was too afraid to get punched out by John to comment.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "So we get in the car and John and I sit in the back seat.  I tried to move as far away from him as I could.  But John is nudging closer and closer--totally invading my personal space.  Finally he tries to put his hand on my knee.  It just freaks me out.  I don't even know why I reacted that strongly to him touching me.  But I jumped in my seat.  And John started to scream:  \"I knew it.  I knew it.\"", "input": "", "output": "Knew what?"}, {"instruction": "That's what I said.  But he almost got us into an accident.  If you remember it was raining almost the entire night and the wind was very strong.  Well Greg almost hit a fire hydrant.  He thought that John was yelling to try to worn him against something.  But John decided that that was the right time to accuse me of having an affair.", "input": "", "output": "Affair?"}, {"instruction": "Can you believe that?  Besides for work, we haven't seen each other other for the last three weeks.  I haven't talked to the man in basically the same amount of time other than to say hello and goodbye.  This was the first night we were having a social interaction, if one can call it that, in the longest time.  So he deliberately showed up to accuse me of cheating on him.  He planned to do it on New Year's Eve!  And the fact that there were other people around didn't stop him.  And the fact that we weren't even a couple anymore didn't faze him either!  I just couldn't believe it!  Caren and I both just stared at him--what the hell was he talking about?  We were all doing him a favor letting him come along with us and he was clearly set on blowing our evening.  It was incredible!", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I told him that he was out of his mind, of course.  Affair!  He was lucky to be in the same space with me.  Affair.  When I talked about letting him have a chance to break up with me, I didn't mean go on and ruin my New Year's Eve.  He was just too much.  And of all things to accuse me of--an affair.  The only man I've been interested in since John and I started dating is you.  And we didn't even do anything to be even remotely called an affair.  What an idiot!  A normal person would have behaved like a gentleman or at least tried to preserve his own dignity.  But he went along and put himself into situation where I, and Greg and Caren, had absolutely no sympathy for him.", "input": "", "output": "It doesn't sound like this story has a happy ending."}, {"instruction": "Well, John deliberately set himself up for a huge disappointment, to say the least.", "input": "", "output": "You mean you didn't let him down easy?"}, {"instruction": "I'd already given all the chances in the world and he chose not to take them so...I wasn't all that bad actually.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, in case you haven't noticed--I'm nice.  I'm very nice!", "input": "", "output": "I will never dispute that."}, {"instruction": "Good.  Now that we got our facts straight, I basically told John that either he cools it that very second or he'll be thrown out of the car.  Manually, if necessary.", "input": "", "output": "And did it work?"}, {"instruction": "No.  He started to cry.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he never felt this way about anyone else before.", "input": "", "output": "And what did you tell him?"}, {"instruction": "That I hope for everyone else's sake he never feels this way again.", "input": "", "output": "Somehow I don't think that really helped the situation."}, {"instruction": "No it didn't.  But Greg stopped the car at that point and got John out.  Then he took him aside and they had a long conversation.", "input": "", "output": "So Greg took care of it."}, {"instruction": "Well sort of.  When they got back to the car, John was no longer crying but he was absolutely horrible for the rest of the evening.", "input": "", "output": "John stayed with you after that?"}, {"instruction": "Remarkable isn't it?  But then John is a remarkable man.", "input": "", "output": "Have a little sympathy Anna.  The man did just lose his heart.  Believe me--it's a painful thing to do."}, {"instruction": "I know.  It's just that I am still so angry with him.  How did I ever consider going out with him?  I knew he was a loser and still I let it happen.  It's all my fault really.", "input": "", "output": "I have to agree with that.  You led him on and then you ripped his heart out."}, {"instruction": "I gave him something to be heart broken about.  I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Personality is still a virgin.", "input": "", "output": "Anna!"}, {"instruction": "I'm just venting Doctor.  That's what I'm suppose to do here, right?", "input": "", "output": "It's getting late Anna.  We should schedule our next appointment."}, {"instruction": "Okay Doctor.  You just name the time and place and I'll be there.", "input": "", "output": "Next Thursday at four."}, {"instruction": "You always manage to take all the potential out of the way you put it.", "input": "", "output": "What would you rather have me say?"}, {"instruction": "I'll see you next Thursday, Anna.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think I can do that with my eyes."}, {"instruction": "Too bad.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Anna.  See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  I'm so terribly sorry.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Anna.  My guess would be that you were at MacWorld and lost track of time.  I'd just about given up on you."}, {"instruction": "That's exactly where I was and when I realized it was getting late it was already four o'clock and by the time...", "input": "", "output": "It's okay Anna.  I got the general SII e-mail announcement.  Frankly I'm surprised to see any of my patients this week."}, {"instruction": "Thank you for being so understanding.", "input": "", "output": "So did you see anything good?"}, {"instruction": "A few things.  I saw the BE booth.  I was a little disappointed to see them lose out to NeXT.  My department got the BE Box as an early Christmas present.  Each year SII gets us some new technology that we want to play with...I mean within reason of course.  But I don't really know what you would be interested in Doctor.  I sort of go and look for ideas, check-out trends, look up old friends.  This is the time when all the geeks come out and play together.", "input": "", "output": "That's not very kind and I never thought of you as a geek."}, {"instruction": "I try very hard to keep my inner geek hidden.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  You're doing a fine job there Anna."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "You're in exceptionally good spirits--so what old friends have you been seeing lately?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor are you implying that I need a good fuck every now and then to keep my spirits up?  Well I won't deny it!", "input": "", "output": "So who is it?"}, {"instruction": "I ran into Martin the first day of the show.  It was at the end of the day and most people had left already.  I turned around and there he was staring at me.", "input": "", "output": "Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Sorry Doctor.  You always seem to remember everything so I just assumed that you would...", "input": "", "output": "Sorry Anna, it just doesn't ring a bell.  When did we talk about him?"}, {"instruction": "It must have been when we just started.  He was sort of my only very slight indiscretion when I was with Bill.  Remember?", "input": "", "output": "I think I do now.  A graduate student you met in New York on the conference.  Right?"}, {"instruction": "That's it.  Well he is all grown up now.", "input": "", "output": "Is he still in school?"}, {"instruction": "Martin is almost done.  In fact he was offered a job at Vertigo Technology Inc.  They do 3D animation and he was going to develop some new rendering technology for them.", "input": "", "output": "Very impressive."}, {"instruction": "Oh he is Doctor.  And he is as nice as I remembered.  I wished I had dumped Bill at the time and took Martin up on his offer.  My whole life...", "input": "", "output": "Anna you basically just met this guy.  You've seen him in New York a couple of years ago for a few days and now what?  It's been a whole two and a half days?  Don't you think it's a bit premature to make these kind of pronouncements?"}, {"instruction": "Perhaps.  But I'd known Bill for a lot longer and look where it got me.  Plus I don't really have a lot of time.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "He is supposed to fly back to Michigan on Friday night right after the show ends.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "I'm trying to talk him into staying through the weekend.  He can try to take a stand-by and he could stay with me for the extra couple of nights--you wouldn't believe just how much hotels in San Francisco run over a weekend stay!", "input": "", "output": "I thought he was doing really well."}, {"instruction": "He was offered the job...in fact he was offered a whole bunch of jobs all over the U.S.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So?"}, {"instruction": "But he is still just a student now.  He needs to graduate first.", "input": "", "output": "And when is that?"}, {"instruction": "Probably this Summer.  Maybe Fall.  You sound like my father.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry.  I'm just a bit concerned.  I hope you'll have a good time together this weekend."}, {"instruction": "Oh we will.  I have plans!", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "In fact I've got to run.  Martin is waiting for me outside in the lobby.  We are going out for dinner and then...who know?", "input": "", "output": "Well, it is getting late."}, {"instruction": "Precisely.  I don't want to keep you Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe I'll come down and see the show.  SII sent me a free pass."}, {"instruction": "Good.  I hope you'll like it Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe I'll run into you there."}, {"instruction": "Maybe.  Well goodbye.  I'll see you next week.  Same time, same place?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  Next Thursday at four.  Take care of yourself Anna."}, {"instruction": "I will Doctor.  Have a good weekend and I'm really sorry again for coming in so late.", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  I'm just fine. Thank you very much.", "input": "", "output": "How was your weekend with Martin?  Was he able to stay the extra days?"}, {"instruction": "We worked it out.  He went home Sunday afternoon.", "input": "", "output": "Was it a good visit?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, you don't have to beat around the bush.  Just get down to it:  \"Did we do it?\"  \"Was it good?\"  \"Are you going to see each other again?\"  Things like that.  Isn't that what you're asking?", "input": "", "output": "So, did you do it?"}, {"instruction": "No we didn't.  And no, it wasn't my choice.  I gave him plenty of opportunities but he chose to ignore them.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And I do like him.  I like him a lot. He is really different.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "He seems gentler and more attentive than any other man I've been with.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "We would spend all day walking around MacWorld and then we would walk to some nice restaurant in Downtown.  By the time we got home...", "input": "", "output": "To your place?"}, {"instruction": "That made the most sense.  Martin was only going to be here for a few days.  But in any case, we would walk and walk all day--I guess I'm getting to be out of shape sitting in my office all day--but by the time we got home, the only thing I wanted to do was take a long hot bath.  And Martin was just such a dear.  He really took care of me.  He made me tea and brought it to me while I was taking a bath.  He entertained me by telling me stories and jokes.  He even tried to sing once but I discouraged him after the first bar.  He would just jump at an opportunity to fulfill my every wish and command.  It was touching.", "input": "", "output": "And the entire time Martin never made a pass at you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I was parading around naked--going to the bath and then walking around nude getting ready for bed.  I usually wear pajamas but I made an exception for these few days.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Martin never once tried to grab me or even made a move that made me feel uncomfortable.  Well, maybe a little of that.  But for the most part he wouldn't even look directly at me.  And believe me Doctor, I tried to get into the most compromising positions in front of him.  But he never looked!  I mean I know that he looked but I never caught him staring at me directly.", "input": "", "output": "How did he make you feel uncomfortable?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't exactly like he made me feel uncomfortable.  It was more that he was sort of going overboard with his attentions and helpfulness.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes he just got to be too much.  For example, he has this foot thing.", "input": "", "output": "Foot thing?"}, {"instruction": "Martin is really into feet.  We would get home and he would go and start the bath for me.  And then he would insist on helping me take off my shoes and socks.  It's not a big deal really, but no one has ever done this to me before.  My parents did of course, but that doesn't count.", "input": "", "output": "What else did he do?"}, {"instruction": "Then he would massage my feet.  He's really good at it.  But I felt sort of uncomfortable by the whole thing--I walked all day and...I just wanted to be all clean first, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "So I would get into the bath, and Martin would get a wash cloth and start to wash my feet and legs.  And I knew he was really tired too.  He even had the time difference working against him.  But he never seemed to get tired of it.  He would just talk to me and rub my feet the whole time.  He would really pay attention to my feet.  I tried to do all sort of things to get his attentions elsewhere but he was very persistent in this foot obsession.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I would arch back and get my head and hair completely in the water.  This makes my breasts and stomach extend above the water and bubbles.  I thought it was very sexy--I saw myself in the mirror doing that and I think it looks pretty good.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure."}, {"instruction": "But Martin was pretty adamant about my feet.  At one point he even started to kiss them.", "input": "", "output": "You look like you didn't like that very much."}, {"instruction": "It's not really my thing.  I mean I sort of liked it.  It was unusual at least to me.  But I would much rather he made his way up my body instead of hanging around down there all the time.  I was practically throwing myself at him.  Why wouldn't he take a hint?", "input": "", "output": "Did he do anything else that bothered you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it was like he was two different people.  On one hand he is this really smart super-educated guy, but when we are alone he turns into this submissive serf or something.  I just don't get it.  I really wanted him to make love to me.  I even told him that on our last day--I figured that it was my last chance for quite awhile and he wasn't getting my hints.  But Martin told me that he just didn't feel worthy of me somehow.  Worthy!?  I told him to get over his shyness and that I'm a very normal and very sexually aroused woman and I wanted him right now.", "input": "", "output": "And how did he respond?"}, {"instruction": "He didn't get a chance--the phone rang and...it just killed the moment.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Do you plan on seeing him again?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he left.", "input": "", "output": "Is he coming back?"}, {"instruction": "Not for a couple of weeks.", "input": "", "output": "That's sooner than I expected."}, {"instruction": "It's a whole two and a half weeks.  You might not think so Doctor, but it's a long time in a budding relationship.", "input": "", "output": "But you knew that he lived far away.  Doesn't he have classes or something?  How can he get out of school?  And didn't you mention that he has no money?  What about the plane ticket?"}, {"instruction": "Martin said that he has some frequent miles saved up and he cannot think of a better way of spending them than on a weekend with me.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So you are hoping this will turn into a..."}, {"instruction": "Of course Doctor!  I'm not into one night stands.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I think Martin is a nice, caring, sensitive guy, and he is very smart too.  Why wouldn't I want him?  He makes me feel good and I like spending time with him.  I just have to explain to him that women have needs too and that he has to do something about that--I'm not letting him leave next time without making love to me.  As it is I...oh, this is very embarrassing!", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I...I just felt so...so...you know?  I find myself wanting to...I just wanted to touch myself all the time.  Martin has left me in this daze and I've been unable to satisfy myself since he left.  Today I had to go into the women's room and make myself have an orgasm.  I just had to!", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And I feel myself getting wet again just thinking about him.  It's just crazy!  I wish he'd made love to me.  I hope he is suffering too now.", "input": "", "output": "Two and a half week is not such a long time."}, {"instruction": "If I continue to feel this way, I would have to go out and get some heavy appliances to take care of my problem!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you'll find a way to satisfy yourself."}, {"instruction": "You know you could help.", "input": "", "output": "Anna!"}, {"instruction": "I just said it for shock value.  I wouldn't want you to do anything--it wouldn't be right now.", "input": "", "output": "So is anything else going on in your life right now?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Basically that's it.  Don't you think it's exciting enough for one week?", "input": "", "output": "Did you introduce Martin to any of your friends while he was here?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I wanted to keep him to myself for awhile.  Maybe when he moves out here in May, I'll start showing him around.", "input": "", "output": "He is planning to move out here?  Doesn't he have a job waiting for him somewhere in Canada or something?"}, {"instruction": "The Bay Area has lots of interesting technology happening.  Martin would have no problem getting a job out here.  I'm even looking at some opportunities for him at SII.  Wouldn't that be great?  We could sneak out for lunch and...well, you know.", "input": "", "output": "You have a one track mind, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I can't help it.  It's Martin's fault.  If only he'd made love to me, I wouldn't be so keyed-up all the time.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Our time is up this week.  I'll see you next week at the same time.  Does that work for you?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  Goodbye Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  Much much better.  But I was very sick all last week.", "input": "", "output": "A 103 fever..."}, {"instruction": "Oh it was just horrible.  I finally went to the doctor and he gave me some antibiotics--Zithromax.  I still feel sort of weak and tired even today.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that."}, {"instruction": "I mean...it's all right now.  Really.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  So shall we talk about your week?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  Let's see.  After I saw you last, I only had two days before I got very sick.  And then I stayed home from work for a whole week.", "input": "", "output": "That's a long time."}, {"instruction": "Well I thought about coming...dragging myself in, but I managed to convince Julian that having the whole programming department sick with something horrible just wasn't in his best interest.  In the end, he insisted that I stay home for as long as my doctor thought necessary.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a good decision."}, {"instruction": "If he'd have made me come in, the first thing I would have done was go over to his office and cough my heart out.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I was feeling so bad I couldn't even read.  I spent the first four days not even getting out bed.  I just lay there watching daytime TV.  Now I feel like I'm completely caught up on pop culture.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Oh, Martin was very nice.", "input": "", "output": "He is here all ready?"}, {"instruction": "No, not yet.  He is arriving late Friday night.  But he called me almost every single day.  He was really worried about me.  It felt very nice.", "input": "", "output": "That he cared?"}, {"instruction": "Well it was just so strange after he left.  He called me the Friday after my last appointment with you, but I was still mad at him for rejecting me like that.  I felt like I really put myself out there--asking him to make love to me.  To have him reject me and in such a strange way.  I felt very confused.", "input": "", "output": "Did Martin try to explain himself over the phone?"}, {"instruction": "When he called, I let him know that I was angry with him for treating me that way.  I told him that I thought that he was playing games with me.  But he insisted that it's not like that at all.  He kept saying that it wasn't me and that it was him.  But he wouldn't say what was wrong.  So I really didn't get anywhere during the conversation.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk again before you got sick?"}, {"instruction": "He called again Sunday morning but I was already feeling crappy.  I told him that it was all his fault that I was getting sick.", "input": "", "output": "How did you figure that?"}, {"instruction": "That he got me so upset that my immune system stopped working.", "input": "", "output": "That's a heavy guilt trip."}, {"instruction": "He deserved it.  And actually, in some weird way, he seemed to thrive on it.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure exactly.  It's just a vague feeling I get when I talk to Martin.  And not all the time for that matter.  It's just that sometimes he...I don't know how to really explain it, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you give me an example?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when I was going on and on about how angry I was at him for mistreating me and how I was going to get back at him--I was joking of course about getting back at him--Martin seemed really interested.  He kept asking me to tell him more.  At first I thought he was just trying to be funny, to change my mood, to make me laugh, but it seemed like it was more than that.  It's not exactly what he was saying to me.  If I had a transcript of our conversation, I don't think that I can point to one thing he said that made me think that he was acting weird.  But you have to believe me Doctor, there was something there.  I don't know what, but...", "input": "", "output": "I believe you.  So did the tone of the conversations change when Martin called while you were ill?"}, {"instruction": "Yes completely.  He was extremely concerned for me and was very distraught at his inability to actually be with me and help me.  I told him that I'd rather it was this way--I didn't want to get him sick as well.  He even sent me a get well present.", "input": "", "output": "What did he send?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, it's really silly actually.  He sent me a pair of shoes.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "And I mean these were the most outrageous shoes I've ever seen.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't even know that they made them like that.  It was like someone took ballet slippers and attached a spiked heel on them.  The heel is over five inches.  This much!  I'm not exaggerating, Doctor.  The part of the shoe that the toes fit into hardly have any contact with the ground.  It's like you have to walk on the tips of your toes but you have a heel to support you.", "input": "", "output": "You tried to walk in them?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.  I mean I stood up in them holding on to a chair.  I was never good at wearing high-heel shoes, so these babies were way out of my league.  I called Martin when I got them on and we were both laughing our hearts out as I tried to walk across the room in them.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ask Martin why he sent you such a strange present?"}, {"instruction": "He told me that he wanted to get me something silly, something completely impractical.  And I had to agree that these shoes were one of the most impractical things anyone could possibly own.  I should have brought them in to show you, Doctor.  You really just wouldn't believe that such things could even exist or that someone would be crazy enough to manufacture them.  But I guess there are always people like Martin who seek out the strange and the bizarre.  That's what I like about him!", "input": "", "output": "Did you have more conversations about his strange behavior and sex avoidance?"}, {"instruction": "When I was sick, we didn't talk about that at all.  I was too out of it to really maintain my side of the conversation.  Martin was just trying to keep my spirits up by telling me funny things about his school and job search.  And the last conversation we had was about those shoes.  But I've been thinking.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe he has a medical problem.  A medical problem is just the kind of thing that would be very hard to talk about, especially with someone you're trying to date.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of medical problem are you thinking about...like impotence?"}, {"instruction": "For example.  What if Martin just can't do it?  What if it stopped working or something?  It would be very embarrassing for him to admit it to me.  We are just getting to know each other.  Maybe he feels like he needs to spend more time with me before he can confide such private things to me.  I think if I had a problem like that, I wouldn't be too anxious to explain it to a person that I was very attracted to.  I mean a person can probably be very sexually attracted to another person but if they have a medical condition they still might not be able to do it, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Did Martin give you any indication that that might be his problem?  When you kissed and got close to each other, did you notice a physical problem?"}, {"instruction": "You mean did I feel him get hard?", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "Actually I know that he could get hard.  The first time we met in New York, it was very obvious.  I even made a mental note that he was a very well-endowed guy.", "input": "", "output": "And last time you saw him in San Francisco?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  I don't remember.  I think I would have remembered if it was as noticeable as last time.  But I'm just...I guess this is another piece of evidence that there might be something physically wrong with him.", "input": "", "output": "Don't jump to conclusions, Anna.  It might be that you just didn't notice."}, {"instruction": "Well what else could it be?  Do you think Martin has AIDS and he is just trying to protect me or something?", "input": "", "output": "AIDS?  No, that's not what I said.  I'm simply saying that you just don't know.  Did you actually ask Martin if there was a medical problem?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I didn't really think of it until this week.  And I felt that it's not a good thing to discuss over the phone.  When he gets here, I can be very supportive and understanding.  I can try to make it easier for him to tell me if there is something wrong with him medically.", "input": "", "output": "So when is he coming?"}, {"instruction": "Tomorrow night.", "input": "", "output": "And he is spending the weekend with you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  He is catching a plane back Sunday afternoon.", "input": "", "output": "And you plan on asking him about his..."}, {"instruction": "Sexual problems when he gets here.  I will probably wait until Saturday, but I'll definitely ask him.  I have to know before we get any further in this relationship.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Remember you can always call me and talk to me if there is something bothering you, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I think I can handle this, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Then I'll see you here next Thursday at four."}, {"instruction": "I'll be here.  I'll tell you all about it then.  Have a good weekend, Doctor.  I know I will.  Even if Martin can't perform, he's still a very good kisser.  And he does have hands!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Anna."}, {"instruction": "Just like that?  Without even asking how I am feeling or anything?", "input": "", "output": "How are feeling Anna?"}, {"instruction": "I would rather talk about my weekend.", "input": "", "output": "I thought you would.  So how was it?  How was Martin?"}, {"instruction": "It was interesting.  Very interesting.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "Martin got in really late Friday night--his plane was late.  He was very tired but also extremely glad to see me.  We took the airporter back to my place and...actually nothing much happened that night.  Martin was just too out of it.  He'd been burning the midnight oil so that he could come out and spend the weekend with me.", "input": "", "output": "So you just got him in bed and let him sleep it off?"}, {"instruction": "Not exactly.  Martin got me in bed.  He got me undressed and helped me with my night shirt.  Then he even washed my feet.  But Doctor, please understand that it wasn't my idea.  I was going to make him tea and get him comfortable.  But somehow the whole thing happened the other way around.  He told me that he was here to take care of me and serve my every wish and command.  He was extremely sweet.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "The beginning of the next day was very similar.  Martin got up a lot earlier than I--he was on Michigan time.  He went out and got some fresh croissants for breakfast.  He made coffee and served it to me in bed.  He even got a single red rose and put it in a little vase on the side of the breakfast tray.  It was very charming.  No other man ever cared enough about me to try this hard.", "input": "", "output": "Did he have breakfast with you?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.  He said that he already had his coffee while I was sleeping and now he just wanted to attend to my every need.  Personally I would have preferred having breakfast in bed together.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't care for his attentions?"}, {"instruction": "No. it's not that.  It was just a little too much.  He made me the absolute center of attention and, as nice as it is to be on the pedestal, it's just a bit lonely up there.", "input": "", "output": "Did you confront Martin on his unwillingness to have sex with you?"}, {"instruction": "Well I didn't just want to blurt it out.  I kept telling him stories of people I knew who had problems that they found very difficult to share even with their closest friends.  I also tried talking about AIDS with him.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He stopped me right away and assured me several times that he didn't have AIDS.  He even told me that he gets tested on a regular basis because he is so paranoid about it.  When I asked him if there was a reason that he was so worried about it, Martin said that, in fact, there is virtually no chance of that since it's been about a year since the last time he did it.  And it wasn't too frequent before that.  At least that told me that he is physically capable of having sex.  I mean he was as of a year ago.", "input": "", "output": "So you still don't have first-hand knowledge?"}, {"instruction": "I do.  But I haven't gotten to that yet.  Doctor Balis, you just have to learn to be patient.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So, to continue with my Saturday morning, after breakfast Martin washed all the dishes and even cleaned up the kitchen a little bit.  Then I told him that I was going to take a quick shower and maybe we could go for a little walk--it was a very nice day as you remember.  But Martin told me that he would like to help me wash up.  Well I wasn't going to pass up that kind of opportunity, Doctor.  I really felt sexually ravenous since he left me high and dry last time and I naturally thought this was my chance.", "input": "", "output": "Naturally."}, {"instruction": "Martin insisted on a bath.  He took my clothes off and then took off his shirt.  He drew the bath and added some bath oil.  Then he helped me in.  He told me to close my eyes and relax and that he was going to take care of the rest.  I heard him put on some soft jazz.  Soon I felt his hands rubbing my legs with a wash cloth.  I swear Doctor, that man has a foot thing.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mind?"}, {"instruction": "It's a bit weird but I can learn to like it.", "input": "", "output": "Did Martin asked you to model those shoes for him?"}, {"instruction": "The \"come fuck me\" shoes?", "input": "", "output": "The ones he sent you as a get well present."}, {"instruction": "Sure.  He thought that I looked really hot in them.", "input": "", "output": "Did you think so?"}, {"instruction": "As long as I was sitting down.  If I tried to walk in them, it was more like the Three Stooges on a unicycle--not a pretty picture but with a possibility for an Oscar in the slapstick comedy category.", "input": "", "output": "Did Martin want you to walk in them?"}, {"instruction": "Not at all.  He told me that these were a fashion accessory, not a running shoe.", "input": "", "output": "Did Martin just want to see you in them or..."}, {"instruction": "I think it would be safe to say that it was more than just a visual thing.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "After the bath--and I have to tell you Doctor, that man could give lessons--he gave me another present.", "input": "", "output": "Something that went along with the shoes?"}, {"instruction": "A black leather something with chains and large metal buckles.  I don't know how he managed to buy one of these things.  I was always too embarrassed to even walk into one of these stores that carry that kind of thing.  I think I told you that my vibrator was a present from a friend.  But Martin managed to pick something out that actually fit me.  And that thing is so strange...not strange but with a very complicated cut.  It took both of us to get me into it.  But I have to say that, with the shoes and the leather thing, I looked like one of those science fiction Road Warrior Mad Max motorcycle mistresses or something.", "input": "", "output": "Did you like the way you looked?"}, {"instruction": "It sort of felt like playing dress up or doing theater.  When I put the spiked shoes and the leather top, I felt different.", "input": "", "output": "Can you describe in what way?"}, {"instruction": "It was in a lot of different ways.  I felt incredibly sexy and the piece of chain that went up and down my crotch...it just felt really good as I moved.  I also felt--this is going to sound silly--sort of powerful.  It was as if I put on a different person as I put on this outfit.  And Martin was helping me to get into this role as well.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "He was at my feet licking my shoes and legs.  God I know it sounds really perverted, Doctor.  But it wasn't like that.  I mean it was.  I wouldn't tell my parents about it.  But it wasn't like this sick, dirty thing.  It was all about fun and acting out fantasies.", "input": "", "output": "Do you ever have fantasies like that?"}, {"instruction": "Not exactly like that.  Sometimes I fantasize about being in complete control.  Sort of directing the whole show.  I tell or even command the guy what to do next and what to touch.  This was a little like that except in some very fundamental way Martin was actually controlling me.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Because it was his fantasy.  He was doing everything I asked, following my every whim, but the whole show was his even though I had the lead part.  But it was still very exciting.  I finally got to see him naked.  I was right--he has a very impressive tool to work with.", "input": "", "output": "Did you actually have intercourse?"}, {"instruction": "No.  But he brought me to orgasm over and over again.  And I also watched him come as he was going down on me and I didn't even touch him.  He reached an orgasm by just playing with me.  I don't know why that struck me as being so extremely sexy, but it did.  I had proof of just how much he enjoyed doing what he was doing.", "input": "", "output": "So you enjoyed the dress up and the mistress and slave act?"}, {"instruction": "I've never done it before.  It was very different and very exciting.  We played the whole weekend until it was time for him to leave.  We never left the apartment to go out for our little walk.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever switch your roles?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Maybe next time.  I would like that.  I would like to do to him what he did to me.  I would love to give him as much pleasure.  But somehow we just ran out of time this visit.", "input": "", "output": "Is he coming back soon?"}, {"instruction": "I hope.  He needs to figure out when he can get away again.", "input": "", "output": "What if he doesn't like playing this game with the roles in reverse?"}, {"instruction": "You mean what if he doesn't like being the master?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Well, I did as he wanted me to do.  I played in his fantasy world.  He'll just have to learn to play in mine.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I think that's all the time we have for today."}, {"instruction": "Time sure flies when you are talking about sex.", "input": "", "output": "Same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "Absolutely.  I'll see you then Doctor.  Have a good weekend.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor Balis.  I'm all right I guess.", "input": "", "output": "You guess?"}, {"instruction": "It's just that tomorrow is Valentine's Day.", "input": "", "output": "Is that a bad thing?"}, {"instruction": "No it's good.  I think people should be encouraged to celebrate their relationships.", "input": "", "output": "So why are you so blue?"}, {"instruction": "I hate that Martin is so far away.  It's especially hard on holidays like these.", "input": "", "output": "You knew that this would have to be a long distance relationship, at least for a while."}, {"instruction": "It doesn't make it any easier that I knew that these kinds of things would happen all the time.  I almost want to go to the airport and jump on a plane and surprise him tomorrow.  Imagine Martin opening his door and it's me.  He would be in shock for the rest of the weekend.", "input": "", "output": "Are you seriously considering doing that?"}, {"instruction": "I can't get away this weekend; I have too much work.  But I'm thinking about next weekend.  It would be even more shocking if I just showed up on no particular weekend, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure Martin would appreciate it?"}, {"instruction": "I think so.  But more than that, I miss him and would like to be with him.  He came out here last time and I think it would be fun if it was my turn.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you've basically made up your mind about going already."}, {"instruction": "The more I think about it, the more I like it.  I'd show up just like that without telling him or even hinting about it in our conversations.  I just can't wait to see the expression of Martin's face when he answers his door.  You know, I went to check out one of those stores.", "input": "", "output": "What stores?"}, {"instruction": "The ones that sell those leather and chain kind of things.", "input": "", "output": "Like what Martin got you as a present?"}, {"instruction": "That's right.  I'd never been in one before.  They're a little creepy and the people who work there have too many of their body parts pierced.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you go?"}, {"instruction": "I just wanted to get a better grip on what Martin's fantasies were all about.  He is really different from anyone I've ever dated before.  Or, for that matter, different from anyone I've known before, period.", "input": "", "output": "Did you learn anything?"}, {"instruction": "It seems that there are a lot of people into this sort of thing.  Otherwise, how else could these stores stay in business?", "input": "", "output": "There are a substantial number of people who enjoy..."}, {"instruction": "I think so too.  Except some of this stuff is so far out there that it doesn't seem real to me.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "Well there was a wall of porno video tapes in this store.  I've seen x-rated movies before, but these were just not like that.  I mean I only saw the pictures on the covers, but they were really different.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "They seemed to be more about pain than sex.  I mean it was hard to tell, but they showed people with these tight clamps on their penises, vaginas, and nipples.  I'm sure it really hurt a lot to do that.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure it does.  But some people incorporate pain as part of their sexual practices.  They get more pleasure when it is mixed with pain."}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure about that.  I thought that maybe it was just movie make up--all make belief and nothing's real.  That explanation makes more sense to me.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that you're right about that.  I suspect that what you saw was for real."}, {"instruction": "What I saw was pretty extreme.  But I do understand having these kind of fantasies once in a while.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have these fantasies?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not exactly like that.  But sometimes I have a dream where a total stranger forces me to have sex with him.", "input": "", "output": "Is it a violent attack?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of.  He rips my clothes off and forces me down.  He feels very strong and somehow overwhelming.  I feel really scared but also very excited.  I want him to take me.  I know that I should be fighting him off, but instead I surrender to him.  Even more, I enjoy him.  I know that this is a really sick fantasy.  Rape is a horrible thing and no one can possibly enjoy it.  But still...I always have orgasms during these dreams.", "input": "", "output": "I think a lot of women have fantasies like that.  These fantasies are not rape fantasies.  And it certainly doesn't mean that the women who have these fantasies want to be actually raped.  Did you ever get hurt in any of your dreams?"}, {"instruction": "No, not at all.  When the stranger was done, he would just leave without saying a word.  And he was usually done when I had my orgasm.  So sexually, these dreams are very fulfilling.  But no, I never got hurt in my fantasies.  It's just that there was this sense of enormous power coming from this stranger.  The feeling that there was nothing I could do to resist him.", "input": "", "output": "There is a sense of power but there is no pain or suffering.  Rape is not about sex, it's about violence.  Your dreams are not about violence.  Being taken by a stranger is a very common fantasy for women."}, {"instruction": "Good.  Because I like the dreams, although I've always been ashamed of them.  Sometimes with Bill, when we made love, I'd try to imagine that he was that powerful stranger and that he wouldn't stop until he made me...you know?  At the end, just before we broke up, Bill just couldn't satisfy me sexually.  I don't even think he wanted to anyway.  Imagining that I was held by the stranger instead of Bill gave me the only pleasure I got out of having a physical relationship with him, although I was still  faking orgasms so that his ego wouldn't be crushed too much.", "input": "", "output": "Do you still think about Bill a lot?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Just once in a while.  I usually think that I was very lucky that our relationship ended.  Just to think that I could still be with him...it makes me shudder.", "input": "", "output": "Did you buy anything at that store?"}, {"instruction": "Originally I went in to get something like what Martin got for me.  Something interesting.  I wanted to wear it under my coat so that when I flew over there and got to his door, I could drop my coat and...well you can imagine.", "input": "", "output": "I can.  Did you get what you wanted?"}, {"instruction": "I just felt too uncomfortable in there.  I tried going to another place near by, but it was even worse.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Actually, I ended up going to Victoria's Secret and getting something there.  It's not leather and there are no metal buckles.  But it's very sexy. I think Martin will like it.  And it's my turn anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Your turn to fly out there?"}, {"instruction": "That and it's my turn to stage the fantasy.  When he was here, we played his games.  And while I liked his unending affections, one way oral sex and hand stimulation just doesn't do it for me.  I like to give just as much as I like to receive, Doctor.  Maybe even more.  And not having actual sex--I mean intercourse--also blows.  I want Martin to make love to me and it's about time that he performed.  So when I say it's my turn, I mean it's my turn to direct the show.  I want him to play out my fantasies.", "input": "", "output": "What if Martin refuses?"}, {"instruction": "Why would he?  How many men do you know, Doctor, that refuse getting a blow job?  And, just for your information, I'm very good.  Very good.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So why would Martin say no to me?", "input": "", "output": "He might not.  But sometimes men who indulge in fantasy role-playing don't enjoy it any other way.  For them, it's more than just role playing.  It's more like a lifestyle.  I'm not saying that this is how it is with Martin.  I just don't know.  But there is a possibility that sadomasochism is his way of life.  I think you should try to talk to him about this some more.  My advice would be to be extremely honest and direct and encourage him to be as well."}, {"instruction": "Sure.  But I don't think that Martin is a pervert, Doctor.  He is a really nice guy.  You'd like him.  He is very caring and sensitive.  And I think he likes me a lot.  I don't think he wants to do anything to hurt me or even upset me.  He is not like those men in the video tapes.  The only thing he has pierced is his ear and a lot of men do that nowadays.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad.  But I think you should still talk about this with him.  Tell him about your visit to the store and your reaction to what you saw there."}, {"instruction": "I can't do that Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Because he would ask me what I was doing there and I would have to come up with an explanation.  And it would ruin my surprise.", "input": "", "output": "So you are definitely planning to fly out to see Martin next weekend?"}, {"instruction": "I think so.  I'll tell you all about it the next time I see you which is after I come back.", "input": "", "output": "I won't see you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Well I wanted to take Friday off and fly out there right after work Thursday.  As it is, there is a two hour time difference and I'll get in really late.  So, if you don't mind, I would like to cancel our next appointment.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "We can do that.  But if, for some reason, you decide not to see Martin, please give me a call and we can reschedule our next session for its regular time.  But for now, I'll see you in two weeks."}, {"instruction": "February 27th it is.  Thank you Doctor.  Have a good Valentine's Day.", "input": "", "output": "You too.  And I hope you'll have a good visit with Martin."}, {"instruction": "I know I will.  Goodbye Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor Balis.  I'm much much better.  I hope you understand about skipping our session last time.  I felt very ungrounded--like my reality sort of slipped into this very bad dream--nightmare really.", "input": "", "output": "But you're doing better now?"}, {"instruction": "I spent a lot of time with my mother.  We did homey things and talked.", "input": "", "output": "What did you talk about?"}, {"instruction": "Oh not about that.  Not with my mother.  I don't think she even knows about that.", "input": "", "output": "So what did you talk about?"}, {"instruction": "She told me how my father and she met.  It was very sweet.  He was a graduate student then and used to shop in the same supermarket as my mother.  She said that he was hopeless--living on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  My mom felt sorry for him and one day introduced herself to him and offered to help him with his shopping.  From that day on, she said that she believed that he was hanging out at the supermarket waiting for her to come in.  After a couple of months, he got the nerve to ask her to dinner--to show off his new skills as a chef which she had encouraged.  They were married six months later.", "input": "", "output": "That is very romantic."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  Things were different 25 years ago.  People were different...more normal.", "input": "", "output": "I think we should talk about what happened to you in Michigan."}, {"instruction": "I know.", "input": "", "output": "What happened after you got off the phone with me that night at the restaurant?"}, {"instruction": "I heard the police walk in and ask for me at the door, so I had to go in a hurry.", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  Did they question you?"}, {"instruction": "First they needed to know the exact location of the house.  I couldn't really tell them over the phone. I didn't know the area at all and I was running to get away from Martin. I got a bit lost.  But I did know what it looked like and it couldn't have been that far away.  So I got in the car with them and we circled the neighborhood until I recognized the house.", "input": "", "output": "Did it take a long time?"}, {"instruction": "Actually it ended up being just around the corner--I must have doubled back that way by accident.  We probably weren't more than five minutes searching.", "input": "", "output": "What did you tell the police about what happened?"}, {"instruction": "I told them that I thought it was a bunch of devil worshippers.  I told them that there was an altar at the front of the room with torture devices.", "input": "", "output": "Altar?"}, {"instruction": "There was this sort of stage at one side of the room and on top of a low table was this contraption to which they tied the girl up.  I told the police about the girl.  They were very interested in how old I thought she was.  I told them she looked like she was still in high school.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure?"}, {"instruction": "She was very young.  I told them that the devil worshipers seemed to be attending some sort of a class.  The man teaching the class must have been the high priest...I mean do they call them priests if they worship the devil?  Well, it's not really important.  He was dressed completely in black leather with a black leather hood covering his face.  His congregation, including Martin, were sitting in chairs facing the altar.  I told the police that as incredible as it sounded, this man was teaching his congregation how to torture this little naked girl.  And he was really doing it.  He was whipping her with split bamboo canes until blood was dripping down her back.  The entire time he was commenting on how to do it right.  Actually I didn't see much more after that.  That's when I started screaming to let the girl go.  And then somehow I got out of that room and was running down the street.  But I think I told you all that.", "input": "", "output": "That's what you told the police?"}, {"instruction": "Pretty much.  Oh, I did tell them that I thought the girl was in a trance of some sort or drugged.  They asked  me if I actually saw any drugs there.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  But she must have been drugged to not be screaming her head off.  And the police also wanted to know if there were any weapons.", "input": "", "output": "Weapons?"}, {"instruction": "Right.  There were lots of whips--big bull whips and these little buggy whips.  And the bamboo cane that he was beating her with.  There was other stuff too--like a big metal ball with spikes on it.  I told them that the room was filled with stuff.  It mostly looked like  medieval torture devices--chains on the walls and a rack like they used in the inquisition.  And there were swords and knives too.  The police asked if there were any guns, but I didn't see any.", "input": "", "output": "Did the police actually raid the house?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  When we found it, they called for back-up and two more cars arrived in a few minutes.  I asked if they could take me away from there.  I really didn't want to face these people again.  So the car I was in drove back to the station and I guess the others stayed back and raided the house.", "input": "", "output": "Why did the police take you to the station?"}, {"instruction": "They wanted to take my statement and they even asked if I would be able to identify any of them.  I never told them about Martin.  I hoped that he had the presence of mind not to go back there after he went after me.", "input": "", "output": "You were trying to protect Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know why.  Somehow I felt that he didn't really belong there.", "input": "", "output": "We'll come back to that.  Do you know if the police arrested any of the people from the house?"}, {"instruction": "I saw them.", "input": "", "output": "You saw them?"}, {"instruction": "It took a long time to do all the paperwork and I was still there when they brought them in.", "input": "", "output": "Into the police station?"}, {"instruction": "I hid behind the filing cabinet and saw as they brought in the leader and the girl and a few others.  They didn't get Martin.", "input": "", "output": "What did they charge them with?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think they did.  It was bad, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "It was as if the officers were just trying to have fun with these people--to humiliate them.  The girl was still naked with only a blanket around her.  They should have taken her to a hospital but instead they dragged her in there.  She was crying.  The man in the mask was yelling that he was a lawyer and that they should all know better than to try to arrest them.  He was screaming something about performing consensual acts.  It was all so horrible!", "input": "", "output": "So you didn't like the way the police treated these people?"}, {"instruction": "No.  If the girl wasn't among them, I might have thought it was appropriate.  But she was there too.  And she was bleeding and crying.  And she must have been freezing cold.  The poor thing!  The Sergeant on duty was laughing and saying that the lawyer was right--perverts deserve kid glove treament.  One of the cops said that if they loved humiliation, they should all be having orgasms now and should be thanking the officers for the good time they were having.", "input": "", "output": "That's very bad."}, {"instruction": "I was raised to believe that the police are my friends.  But now...I believe that police took advantage of me.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "They knew what was going on in that house.  They must have realized that I was completely clueless. But instead of trying to comfort me and explain the situation, they used me to have some fun.  Please understand, Doctor, I think that what these people were doing was wrong.  Very wrong.  But I understand now that the girl was there because she wanted to be.  If the police took the girl and brought her home to her parents, or suggested a mental facility that might help her with her unhealthy tendencies, I would have applauded them.  But they wanted to see her naked and shivering.  That's cruel.  That's worse than the whipping she was getting at that S&M club because at least there she consented.", "input": "", "output": "That's quite a turnabout in your thinking."}, {"instruction": "I'm not stupid even if I may be naive.  The police weren't treating them like criminals.  It was different.  So I did some research into S&M and found that what I saw was pretty typical of what they describe in the books.", "input": "", "output": "So you now believe that Martin did take you to an S&M club and not to a devil-worshipping service?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, although I still find it completely incomprehensible.  These people weren't role playing, which I would understand. They were trying hard to inflict pain upon each other.  That's just not normal.", "input": "", "output": "Did you speak with Martin since all of this happened?"}, {"instruction": "When I got back home, I had dozens of messages on my machine.  In fact the tape ran out, so there could have been more, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Were they all from Martin?"}, {"instruction": "A couple were from you.", "input": "", "output": "I was worried about you."}, {"instruction": "I know.", "input": "", "output": "Did you call Martin back?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure I have anything to say to him yet.", "input": "", "output": "So you've had no communication for the past two weeks?"}, {"instruction": "There were lots of messages.  But I didn't even want to listen to them.", "input": "", "output": "You don't know what he said?"}, {"instruction": "I have an idea.  But I don't want to even hear his voice right now.  It took me a whole week with my parents just to be able to sleep through the night.", "input": "", "output": "You're having problems sleeping? Are you having nightmares?"}, {"instruction": "Not exactly.  I'm just replaying that whole night in my head over and over again.  As soon as I stop trying to concentrate on other things, the images pop right into my mind again and I can't help play out the whole story again.  Luckily, because I was gone for a whole week and have lots of work piled up, I don't need to go home.  I can work late into the night and...", "input": "", "output": "You'll have to learn to sleep at night."}, {"instruction": "Repress, repress, repress--that's my strategy.", "input": "", "output": "I recognized it immediately.  But we should work on putting this incident behind you."}, {"instruction": "I know you're here for me, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Unfortunately our time is up for this week.  But perhaps we should meet sooner than next week?"}, {"instruction": "No, no.  I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself for a week.", "input": "", "output": "Well then, call me if things aren't going well, okay?"}, {"instruction": "If the phone rings in the middle of the night, you'll know that it's me.", "input": "", "output": "No problem."}, {"instruction": "Well Doctor, have a good week and thank you for listening to me.  You are the only one who knows what happened to me that night.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't tell anyone else?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the police.  But otherwise, I didn't think it was a good idea.  Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna.  Take care."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  I'm doing better.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Are you sleeping?"}, {"instruction": "I still have lots of problems falling asleep.  I start thinking and then...you know how it is.  One thought after another and I get myself completely worked up.  But once I actually fall asleep, I'm able to sleep through the night.", "input": "", "output": "You had a very traumatic experience, Anna.  It will take some time to get over it."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But it's still hard now.", "input": "", "output": "It will get better.  I think we should spend time talking over everything that happened."}, {"instruction": "Yes, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Is Martin still trying to get in touch with you?"}, {"instruction": "He kept calling and calling but I was set on ignoring him.", "input": "", "output": "You still haven't spoken with him?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't say that.", "input": "", "output": "So you are communicating now?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of.  I told him that I would think about it.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I think it's important not to leave this unresolved."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's more then just that.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I think I still like him.  I mean you would think that after all that happened I would want nothing to do with the guy.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "But I keep thinking about him.  If it wasn't for what happened in Michigan, I would consider him one of the nicest people I know.  Certainly one of the smartest and most caring.", "input": "", "output": "And the incompatibility of your sexual preferences?"}, {"instruction": "The foot thing?  Frankly, I don't particularly mind.  I think it's weird, but then oral sex is weird and I like that.", "input": "", "output": "For Martin the \"foot thing\" was just one aspect of his sexuality.  The S&M scene that you witnessed is one of the defining characteristics of Martin's personality.  Being a submissive--a \"bottom\"--is a lot more then just role playing for Martin.  You do have to understand that, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I'm trying, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "If you are interested in Martin, you will have to accept him for all that he is."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But Martin is a lot more then just an S&M freak.  He has a great ability and desire to love someone, to please the subject of his affections, to deeply care not for just the surface features but for the very soul of the person.", "input": "", "output": "You do sound like you still like Martin a lot."}, {"instruction": "I do.  I really do, Doctor.  I can't help it.  I thought it would just go away, but...", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, Anna.  You're allowed to like him."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.  I didn't think you would understand.", "input": "", "output": "Martin didn't do anything wrong other than not fully explaining his passions to you."}, {"instruction": "Passions.  That's a good way of putting it.  Now I know what to tell my parents:  \"I met this guy and I like him.  He is full of passions.\"", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to see your sense of humor is back."}, {"instruction": "When your life resembles a bad comedy act, you should at least have a sense of humor to appreciate it.", "input": "", "output": "That helps."}, {"instruction": "You know after I left your office last week, I took a long walk, just sort of meandering along the city streets.  There are a lot of really strange people in San Francisco.", "input": "", "output": "You just noticed?"}, {"instruction": "I pay more attention to it now.  And it's not only the people who dress up to express their peculiarities.  It's people who you would never suspect of being strange.  I keep thinking about that guy with the leather outfit and a mask screaming in the police station that he is a lawyer.  I bet, when he is in his business suit, no one ever suspects him of having \"passions.\"", "input": "", "output": "I bet you're right."}, {"instruction": "At least Martin with his romantic tendencies...you know what he did?", "input": "", "output": "No, what?"}, {"instruction": "He flew out here for a day.", "input": "", "output": "He called me the Monday after your visit to Michigan and told me that he was planning to do that.  But I had assumed that he had given up that idea."}, {"instruction": "Nope.  He flew out here Tuesday morning.  I was at work already when he got here.  But he didn't waste his time.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?  Martin went to see you at SII?"}, {"instruction": "No.  The apartment building across the street from mine is being painted right now.  They've have been fixing cracks and trying out paint swatches for about four days.  When Martin got here, they still didn't have it painted yet.  Somehow he managed to convince the contractors to paint a large \"I LUV U ANNA\" sign on the side of the building facing my windows with one of the swatch colors.  When I got home, Martin was sitting on the front steps of my building with a huge bucket of flowers.  He must have been waiting for a couple of hours.  As I walked up the street, I saw the sign.  I couldn't believe it.  I was happy and embarrassed all at the same time.  I must have been completely flushed red as I approached, for the painters realized that I was the \"Anna.\"  They started cheering and laughing.  The people on the street were pointing at me and the two story-high sign.  You see?  This proves that Martin is a complete lunatic, but a very lovable one.", "input": "", "output": "I imagine it was quite a sight.  Is it still up?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no.  It was gone the next day when they painted the whole building with that color.  But even for the few hours that it was up...how can you not talk to the guy after that?", "input": "", "output": "It would be hard."}, {"instruction": "When Martin handed me the flowers, the people on the street and the painters were all cheering and clapping.  I though I would be in the morning editions for sure.  You have to admit, that that was very romantic.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it was.  But even that doesn't change the fact that Martin expresses his sexuality as a bottom in an S&M fashion."}, {"instruction": "Back to that.  I know.  But you know, Doctor, so many people are abusive even without a claim to S&M preferences.  When I think of all the torment Bill put me through, just to mention one example, it was so much more sadistic then anything that Martin and his friends have in mind.  Bill was into psychological abuse.  He didn't care if I experienced any pleasure from it.  He hurt me because he could.  Martin is different.", "input": "", "output": "I see your point.  But are you prepared to act the way Martin wants you to?  For example, would you whip him if he asked?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  It looked like it would really hurt a lot.  I don't know if I could do something like that to another human being, especially one I care for.  But I'm doing research in that area.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I need to understand this whole S&M business better.  Why do people get pleasure from it when they are obviously getting hurt in the process?  I want to understand that.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of research are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing drastic yet.  I just went to a little bookstore that I found in North Beach.  There was a girl that works there, Kathy, who was very nice and showed me some books and explained a little about the equipment that is used.  I think I'll start by reading about it first.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you are contemplating trying some of this out yourself."}, {"instruction": "I feel like I can't really hurt Martin, the way that he'd want me to, if I didn't experience how it feels myself first.", "input": "", "output": "You mean you want to get whipped?"}, {"instruction": "I want to know just how much it hurts and where the pleasure comes from.", "input": "", "output": "Are you planning to do this with Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so.", "input": "", "output": "You're going to ask Martin to whip you?"}, {"instruction": "I've thought about it.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I would stop right away if it didn't feel right.  Really, Doctor, I'm not a masochist.  I don't like pain.  But I need to know how it feels like before I can do it to someone else.  Do you understand?", "input": "", "output": "I just don't want you to get hurt.  Or to do something that you really don't want to do, Anna."}, {"instruction": "If it's not right, I'll stop.  And I'm not planning on doing it any time soon.  I will stick to reading about it for a while.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Martin talks about a sexual rush that occurs.  It didn't sound like a bad thing.  Although I wish there were other ways he could feel that way.  I feel the rush when I perform oral sex on a guy.  I wonder if it's the same thing.", "input": "", "output": "I think doing more research and talking about all of this first is a good idea.  Is Martin planning to come out here again soon?"}, {"instruction": "He can't until the end of the semester.  It's better that way.  It gives us both a chance to think things over.", "input": "", "output": "Did he leave Tuesday?"}, {"instruction": "He had to get to the airport shortly after he met me at the door.  We barely had a chance to talk.  But when he got home, he called me and we've been talking ever since.  Don't be upset with me, Doctor.  I don't think Martin is evil.  Just mixed up.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think Martin is evil, either."}, {"instruction": "It's just the way you look at me when I talk about him.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.  My job is to help you sort things out, not to make judgments."}, {"instruction": "Maybe.  But I know you care about me.", "input": "", "output": "I do, Anna.  Our time is up.  Is this time next week good for you?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.  I'll see you then.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  I had an interesting week.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I'm learning a lot, doing a lot of research...", "input": "", "output": "About S&M?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I'm trying to figure out what makes people like this sort of stuff.  I already know that some of it is just not for me.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "Needles.  I hate needles.  And piercing.  That's also bad.  Actually any kind of skin or flesh penetration makes me extremely uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "Is it something that Martin likes?"}, {"instruction": "No.  He said that's not the sort of thing that turns him on either.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been talking with Martin a lot?"}, {"instruction": "A fair amount.  I'm not sure how to put it exactly.  But in the beginning of our relationship, there was this frenzy.  It was like we were both in heat and it was affecting our judgment and our ability to communicate with each other.", "input": "", "output": "You think that's changed?"}, {"instruction": "I do.  There is still the sexual tension and anxiousness.  But I no longer feel like I have to hurry.  I'm sure I'm not saying this right.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay.  Go on."}, {"instruction": "When Martin and I first got together again in January, there was a feeling of urgency about our relationship.  It was as if we had to rush everything to firm up the bond between us.  We tried to hurry up and get to know each other before we drifted apart.  It could have been the pressure of Martin living so far away.  Or perhaps Martin was afraid that I would find out about him before I liked him enough to understand.  I think we both felt like there wasn't enough time.  But now, this has all changed.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "I no longer feel the need for such speed in the development of this relationship.  I want to take my time.  I want to know exactly what I'm getting into--to get into it with my eyes open, so to speak.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds very wise."}, {"instruction": "I think so.  So I've been studying.  Doing my homework.  And in the meantime, Martin and I simply talk on the phone.  What I'm trying to say is that my attitude toward this relationship changed.  I feel like I'm in control--not only in control of Martin, but in control of my own feelings.  If I intellectually decide that this is not for me, I'll be able to simply walk away.", "input": "", "output": "Has the heat has gone out of your relationship?"}, {"instruction": "Not at all.  I'm just not being stupid about this guy.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What do you talk to Martin about?"}, {"instruction": "Lots of things.  Why?", "input": "", "output": "I was just interested.  Is it something you don't want me to know about?"}, {"instruction": "It's the usual.  Nothing that strange.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "We talked about our childhood, books we like, movies.  I asked him questions about S&M and how and why he got into it.", "input": "", "output": "Did he tell you?"}, {"instruction": "He said that it was not something that he was into from birth.  I mean, he wasn't born liking it.  No, that's not right.  He didn't know for a long time that he liked it.", "input": "", "output": "How did he discover this about himself?"}, {"instruction": "He said that about two years ago, he met a woman that liked playing it rough, as Martin put it.  It wasn't an S&M thing really.  Just sort of dressing up in costumes and playing out scenes--slave and master sort of thing.  Martin said that she was a History major specializing in the early Greeks.  At some point Martin realized, I guess, that he really liked this sort of thing.  That relationship never worked, but Martin discovered something about himself as a result.  After that, Martin said that he always tried to suggest that particular type of role-playing to his partners.", "input": "", "output": "How did Martin evolved from role-playing to a true S&M player?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I guess if you do it often enough, you discover the community.  At least that's what Kathy told me.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "The girl from the dirty bookstore.  I told you about her last time.", "input": "", "output": "Is Kathy into S&M?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.  She never said that.  But I assume that she knows a whole lot of people who are--they all shop there.", "input": "", "output": "So Kathy has been your S&M tutor?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of.  We went out for coffee once after I bought some books in her store.  She was helping me out with phone S&M.", "input": "", "output": "With what?"}, {"instruction": "You've heard of phone sex, Doctor Balis, haven't you?", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you're doing with Martin?"}, {"instruction": "A variant of that.  We tried doing some--I don't know...theater?--over the phone.  I tell him what I'm wearing and where I am in my apartment.  Usually it's involves being completely naked but for the pair of super-high-black-leather-spiked-heeled shoes that Martin gave to me.  You know?  The \"Come Fuck Me\" shoes.", "input": "", "output": "You told me about them."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I did.  I tell Martin what I want him to do for me and describe his punishments over the phone.  It's sort of fun.  The first time we tried this, it went rather badly.  I really didn't know what to do.  But I talked with Kathy and she gave me a lot of pointers.  Now I can do it like a pro.  Did you know that there are women who do this professionally?  You can call them and give them your credit card number and they'll abuse you for money!", "input": "", "output": "I know about phone sex services."}, {"instruction": "I think that what Martin and I are doing is better than that.  I really do get naked and do the things that I tell him I do.  I don't think the pros on the phone do that.  The only thing I don't do is wear those shoes.  They are too uncomfortable.  And Martin would never know anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Does this type of phone sex turn you on?"}, {"instruction": "It has its moments.  If you are asking me whether I have orgasms, I do.", "input": "", "output": "You said you started doing this last week, how many times do you think you've done this so far?"}, {"instruction": "About five.", "input": "", "output": "Is that every night?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have other conversations other than phone sex?"}, {"instruction": "Of course!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I told you, we talk about books, and movies, and other stuff we like to do.  It's not all about sex.", "input": "", "output": "So is this all fantasy or do you think you would really try any of the things you talk to Martin on the phone about?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe.  I don't know yet.  It's one thing to talk about inflicting pain and it's completely different to actually do it.", "input": "", "output": "I agree."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I think you're angry with me!", "input": "", "output": "I'm not angry with you, Anna.  I just don't want you to do something that you don't want to do."}, {"instruction": "He surprised me too.  I think it's beautiful.", "input": "", "output": "He shows you without a head and with screws and nails hammered into your leg."}, {"instruction": "I thought it was quite surrealistic too.", "input": "", "output": "Did he talk to you about this drawing?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he had a dream about me one night.  It was so vivid that it awakened him.  Martin said that he drew this in the middle of the night right after he had the dream.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Did he tell you the dream?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Actually, he didn't.  I'll ask him about it next time.  But I do think that he is talented.  I can't draw a straight line if my life depended on it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Our time is up for today.  I'll see you next week, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I'll look forward to it, Doctor.  And don't hate Martin so much.  He is really not so bad once you get to know him.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "Please don't get the impression that I hate Martin.  I'll see you next week, Anna.  Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  I'm fine, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "How is Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I think he's happy.", "input": "", "output": "Happy because of you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm willing to take the credit.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'm turning into quite a dominatrix.  It seems I have talent in areas previously unexplored.", "input": "", "output": "So Martin is enjoying your phone..."}, {"instruction": "Sex.  It's like running an S&M radio play.  We even do sound effects.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, like a sound of a whip or falling chairs.", "input": "", "output": "Falling chairs?"}, {"instruction": "You had to be there.", "input": "", "output": "I guess.  Are you enjoying all of this as much as Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Well, enjoyment is relative.  I'm enjoying making Martin happy.  And how can one judge feelings like that anyway, it's all so...", "input": "", "output": "You are avoiding answering my question."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I am.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well some stuff is very fun.  And I do have orgasms every time.  Sometimes more then once per conversation.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "There were occasions when Martin would describe a behavior or an act that he was doing or wants to do, and I...sometimes he just makes me cringe!  There.  Happy, Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I think you're taking my questions the wrong way.  I don't want you to admit to not enjoying Martin's company.  On the contrary, since you obviously have a strong emotional attachment to him, I want to hear that you are very happy with your relationship.  Of course, I only want to hear that if it's true.  So what is it that makes you uncomfortable?"}, {"instruction": "Well, remember I told you that Martin is sort of into feet?", "input": "", "output": "I remember.  Martin has a foot fetish."}, {"instruction": "I guess that's what it's called.", "input": "", "output": "Does Martin want to do something with your feet that you find objectionable?"}, {"instruction": "It's not my feet exactly.  The other day when we were on the phone, Martin described a fantasy that he had about us going out to dinner.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "In the fantasy, we are sitting in a booth of a very crowded restaurant.  While we are pretending to have a rather innocuous discussion on the surface, we are playing footsies under the table.  Martin was very specific describing what I was wearing--a pair of silk stockings and bright red spiked-heeled leather shoes.  I was sitting across from him and could easily stretch my foot to touch his crouch.  He told me that I did so frequently driving him to madness with excitement.", "input": "", "output": "Did that bother you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  That part was okay.  It was even sexy.  But he told me what he did next and...I had to pretend on the phone that I really liked it and that it was extraordinary exciting to me.  But in fact, it was just horrible!", "input": "", "output": "What did Martin do?"}, {"instruction": "He slipped the shoe off my foot and took it away with him when he went to the men's room.  When he came back and gave me back my shoe it was full of...it was gross!  Martin said it was full of the \"proofs of his love.\"  Yeech!  What was I supposed to do with it?", "input": "", "output": "What did Martin want you to do with it?"}, {"instruction": "He told me that in his fantasy I put on the shoe with all that stuff in it.  He even went in to details of how it would feel on the sole of my foot.  I almost lost it!  Thank god it was just a fantasy.  I would have thrown up all over him and walked home barefoot if it had happened for real.", "input": "", "output": "But you didn't tell Martin that.  You went along with his fantasy and pretended to like it?"}, {"instruction": "I knew that he was touching himself as he was telling me this story.  I didn't want to spoil it for him.  And it wasn't real.  I just have a very good imagination and could really sense just what it would feel like on my foot.  Yuck!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Look Anna, these phone conversation are sort of a dry run for a very real sexual relationship that you and Martin will have once he comes out here again.  If you make Martin believe that you're enjoying all of his fantasies, he will have no way of knowing any different and he'll expect you to act the same in real situations."}, {"instruction": "I know.  I know.  But you see, not all of it is bad.  I do get off on some of the scenarios that Martin's proposed to me.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  But you have to tell him what makes you uncomfortable or you'll end up being in a situation that..."}, {"instruction": "I know.  I can see it all now.  But I think Martin will change somewhat by then.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Did I tell you that he got thrown out of his S&M club?", "input": "", "output": "No, but I can't say that I'm surprised."}, {"instruction": "They really hate him now.   I don't think that Martin will be granted membership anywhere in United States.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I doubt that news of Martin's stupidity will travel that far.  I don't think those clubs are quite so tightly affiliated.  But do you know what happened that night after you left the club?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently, after I ran out of there, Martin held back a few minutes to reassure everyone not to worry.", "input": "", "output": "So that's why Martin never caught up with you."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I got a few minutes lead time to get away.  At the club, Martin told them that I was his girlfriend and that he would explain everything to me.  And he told them that he hadn't realized that I would react this way.  And that I was from out of town and staying at his place and that I was probably on my way there and he'd catch up with me and have a long talk.  He apologized for me and for his own thoughtlessness.  And so on, and so on.", "input": "", "output": "I was wondering why those people stayed after you ran out of there screaming.  I would assume, by the very nature of their organization, that they would be a pretty cautious bunch--disappearing at the first sign of trouble.  I was surprised when you told me that the police were able to bust in on them and even apprehend them in the act."}, {"instruction": "Martin is a good talker.  I guess he made them believe that everything was okay and that I didn't represent any danger to them.", "input": "", "output": "I have to say that predicting that you'd call the police and describe the club as a demonic cult with drug use, weapons, and sexual torture of minors, was a long shot.  But Martin still should have known better than to take you there unprepared."}, {"instruction": "Now that you say it, Doctor, it does sounds like my behavior was just a bit extreme.  But I was terrified and I do have an excellent imagination.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you do."}, {"instruction": "But in any case, when the police arrived at the S&M house that night, everyone was still there.  Everyone, that is, except for Martin.", "input": "", "output": "Who was out looking for you."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Some members of the club later accused Martin and me of setting them up, refusing to believe that I would call the police out of ignorance.  Some even threatened him with violence.  But ironically, they're really not into that kind of violence.  The up shot is that he is completely ostracized from the S&M community.  And you know what, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "That makes me happy.  I'd never tell him that, of course.", "input": "", "output": "Of course."}, {"instruction": "But I think it is good for him.  I don't think these clubs were the right thing for Martin.  I think in the long run he will be happier not being part of that community.  At least he has a better shot with me that way.", "input": "", "output": "You know you shouldn't try to change Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not trying to change him.  But I think with distance from the whole S&M scene, Martin just might not find it as appealing as he does right now.  And with time...", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you're right about this, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Maybe not.  But what do I have to lose?  Well, our time is up, Doctor.  Next week--same time, same place?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  I'll see you next week, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.  You want to see Martin's latest?", "input": "", "output": "You mean his drawings?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  He sent yet another one.  This one is quite nice.", "input": "", "output": "Let me see."}, {"instruction": "Here.  It's based on the story I told Martin over the weekend.  I can't believe how fast he is.", "input": "", "output": "Interesting.  You seemed to be turning into a plant in this one.  And the head is missing again.  You say it's based on a story you told Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I told him about a science fiction story I read a long time ago.  It was from a collection of short stories about alien sex.", "input": "", "output": "Interesting.  This is Martin's interpretation of the story?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it doesn't actually have much to do with the story.  But it's quite nice.", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "The story was actually about this female plant on a far away planet.  Do you what to hear about it, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "I thought it would be the kind of story that Martin would find erotic.  Personally, I thought it was a bit strange.  But I like that kind of stuff.", "input": "", "output": "What made you think that Martin would find it erotic?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it was about this man who was shipwrecked on a planet with these plants.  He got badly hurt during the crash and realized that he was probably going to die.  But, if I remember correctly, he heard this telepathic voice and responded to it.", "input": "", "output": "Did the man understand the voice?"}, {"instruction": "No, not at first.  But we are getting ahead of the story.", "input": "", "output": "Sorry."}, {"instruction": "The man realized that the voice was coming from this giant plant pod that was not far from him.  This plant pod was trying to communicate with the man.  It calmed him down and made him feel good.  Something about the plant pod was very sensual and inviting.  There were others like it all around.  But most were bigger and only this one seemed to be able to move a little.  When the pod rolled close to the man, the feeling of well-being increased.  The man saw water inside the plant and, on what seemed to be the pod's invitation, crawled inside.", "input": "", "output": "How is this story erotic?"}, {"instruction": "You have no patience, Doctor.  Inside, the pod was dark and warm and very moist.  The man tasted the liquid secreted by the pod on its inner walls.  It was sweet and thick.  After a while, the man fell asleep inside the pod.  Eventually, he woke up and ate some more.  The man's wounds began to heal and he was beginning to feel better.  Soon he was even able to communicate with the pod.  The man learned that his host was a young female and fairly intelligent although not as far evolved as humans were.  She mostly responded to emotions and music.", "input": "", "output": "This is a story of a love affair between two species?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of.  The man grew to depend on the pod and even became attached to it emotionally.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Anna.  But do you really want to spend our whole session telling me about this story?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll get to the point.  The pod wanted the man to help facilitate its reproduction.  It felt the sharp edges of the knife that came with his gear.", "input": "", "output": "A knife?"}, {"instruction": "The thick plant juices dissolved the man's clothes.  All he was left with was a knife.", "input": "", "output": "What about other metal items like buttons..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, you're so literal.  Maybe the pod simply spat them out.  I don't remember and it's not relevant to this story.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "The point was that to reproduce and to feel sexual pleasure, the alien plant pod needed to be ripped from the inside with a sharp tool.", "input": "", "output": "What about other pods on this planet.  Did they have their own crash survivors?"}, {"instruction": "No, they used animals with sharp teeth and claws.  But this particular pod was different.  She really cared for the man and realized that he was intelligent too.  When she gave birth to her daughters, she let the man help her raise them.  In some ways, it was a very touching story--two completely alien intelligences grow to depend on each other for life and friendship.", "input": "", "output": "So did the man willingly cut the pod's insides?"}, {"instruction": "He refused at first.  But then he realized that it wasn't about pain, it was about love.  When I told this story to Martin, he immediately saw the similarities.", "input": "", "output": "The similarities to what?  S&M?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes.  S&M is also about love.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Martin tried to describe the feeling that he gets when he is being whipped by his mistress.  It's not really about pain.  I mean he does feel pain, but it's more about being able to trust someone so completely and to be able to let go to another person.", "input": "", "output": "You sound like you are interested in trying it out?"}, {"instruction": "I told you that I could never do it to Martin until I try it myself.", "input": "", "output": "So are you going to ask Martin to whip you?"}, {"instruction": "I thought about it.  But I don't know if Martin could do it.  He told me that to really understand the experience, it should be tried with a real top.", "input": "", "output": "A top?"}, {"instruction": "That's what Martin calls it.  There's a top and a bottom.  Martin's a bottom.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  The bottom is submissive?  Martin wants you to be the top and you don't have much experience."}, {"instruction": "I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Is Martin telling you to try it with someone else?"}, {"instruction": "We didn't really talk about that.  But I brought it up with Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy's the lady from the adult bookstore, right?  Is Kathy into S&M?"}, {"instruction": "She is a card-holding member.  But she said that it's mostly for business.  She doesn't do it too often, it's not really her thing.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been seeing Kathy a lot lately?"}, {"instruction": "Just a couple of times.  We met on Saturday to go the beach together.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you are becoming friends."}, {"instruction": "I like her.  She is very easy to talk to--about any subject, not just S&M.  And she is a very nice down-to-earth person despite the fact that she is working in a leather shop.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "We took a nice long walk on the beach and I got her up-to-date on Martin and me.  It was actually funny.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "We saw a couple of her customers on the beach.  One even waved hello to us.  Kathy told me about what kind of things they shop for.  She said that a lot of her customers are not really into S&M--they do pretend and dress-up sessions, but don't actually use the stuff on each other.", "input": "", "output": "They just play with whips."}, {"instruction": "Right.  It's sort of what I would rather do--pretend and act out different scenes, but not actually do it.", "input": "", "output": "Then you should tell Martin that.  I'm worried that your phone S&M can give Martin a wrong idea about what you actually like--about what turns you on."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure Martin knows by now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not."}, {"instruction": "I think I try to be very specific.  And the picture he sent me this week doesn't have any nails.  Not even thorns.  There are no whips, just plants.  I think he is realizing what I like.", "input": "", "output": "I still think that you should try to be explicit.  Tell Martin that it's role-playing that turns you on and not physical pain or the infliction of pain.  Make sure that he knows that what you like to do is pretend."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll talk to him.  But I'm sure Martin knows this, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "It wouldn't hurt to repeat it then."}, {"instruction": "I'll do it, I'll do it.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Then I'll see you next week, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I'll be here, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.  I think I've made a decision to do it.", "input": "", "output": "To do what?"}, {"instruction": "I've been talking with Martin and he agrees that if I need to try being the bottom before being his top, then I should just go ahead and do it.", "input": "", "output": "You mean Martin is encouraging you to go and get whipped?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "By whom, Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "No, of course not.  And she's a bottom anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Then by whom?  A total stranger?"}, {"instruction": "Well, there won't be any hard feelings that way.", "input": "", "output": "Martin doesn't mind if you go and get whipped by someone you've never met?"}, {"instruction": "He wants it to be some one really good.  But that's where Kathy comes in.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I told you that Kathy is really plugged into the S&M community in San Francisco.  She knows everyone and could recommend a very good top.  Did you know that some of them have a reputation as being very talented at what they do?  They even each specialize in particular techniques.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I really don't think it's..."}, {"instruction": "Relax, Doctor.  I'll meet him first.", "input": "", "output": "You picked the top already?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Kathy arranged it all.  There is this flea market this Sunday where they all get together and swap instruments and outfits and stuff.  That's where I'll meet him.", "input": "", "output": "A flea market?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, a flea market.  Aren't you listening Doctor? But I have to say, I thought it was wild too.  All these people getting together and shopping for second-hand hand-cuffs and floggers and who-knows-what.  Kathy said that it's really cool.  Sort of like a big party.  People talk to each other and try things out--just have a good time.", "input": "", "output": "The last S&M party you went to didn't appeal to you much, if you remember."}, {"instruction": "But I was completely unprepared for it.  This time I know better.  And the scene will be different, anyway.  This will be very low key, very casual.  No one will really be doing anything--just shopping and talking, that's all.", "input": "", "output": "Right, just a little paddling, nothing much."}, {"instruction": "That's right, Doctor.  There's nothing to worry about.  And if I don't like it, we'll leave.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy will go with you?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  It's a closed party--invitation only.  Kathy said that it will be a good introduction to the community.  I get to meet people in more or less normal circumstances.  Sure there'll be some dress-up and a little action here and there.  But mostly it won't be anything that you won't see on Castro Street for example.  And I'll meet Gray.", "input": "", "output": "Gray is your talented top?"}, {"instruction": "Yup, a whip master from the Far East.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I'm just fooling around.  But Gray does have a very good reputation.  Kathy said that he did her once.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "Kathy's point is that if I'm going to get whipped, it might as well be from someone who knows what he is doing.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I really think that this is a very bad idea."}, {"instruction": "I know, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You know?"}, {"instruction": "I knew that you were going to say that.  But if I don't do this, I will wonder for the rest of my life.  And if I don't like it, I always can use my safe word and Gray will stop.  It's completely safe and in my control.  Anyway, it's not definite yet.  I have to meet him first and then...you know I keep thinking about all my other boyfriends.", "input": "", "output": "Huh?  You mean Bill?"}, {"instruction": "Bill, too.  Can you imagine what they would think if only they knew that I was going to be a real leather-clad dominatrix?", "input": "", "output": "Anna, it really shouldn't be about what other people in your past will think.  I cannot stress enough how wrong I think this whole thing is for you."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, thank you for caring so much about me.  Really, I appreciate it more than you think.  But I'm not losing my head over this.  If I don't like it, I don't like it. I won't do it if it doesn't feel right.  I promise.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "Kathy will help me pick out a real nice and sexy leather thing to wear.  I swear, if only Bill...and I don't mind if David saw me in it too.  These men had such power over me.  But now...maybe I'll wear the leather thing under my clothes to work one day.  Even if no one sees it, I'll know that I have it on and...it's really about attitude anyway.  Maybe I'll show you.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "Just kidding, Doctor.  But I'll let you know when I have it on.  You can use your own imagination.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "I wonder just how many people there are who are fairly normal on the outside and are wearing a sexual secret underneath?  It would certainly make me feel pretty special.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, you are a very special person even if you don't wear leather under your clothing and whip people for pleasure.  You are trying to change yourself into someone that Martin will find sexually stimulating.  You are willing to expose yourself to pain--which I don't think you've ever found sexually stimulating yourself--just to please a guy.  This isn't about being powerful.  It's another example of you allowing yourself to be manipulated by your sexual partners."}, {"instruction": "That's not true.  I'm doing this for my own intellectual and sexual gratification.", "input": "", "output": "How is that?  If it wasn't for Martin..."}, {"instruction": "Martin doesn't want to whip me.  He wants me to do it to him.  I just want to try it out before I take the whip into my own hands.  It's perfectly reasonable--don't do something unto others until you try it out on yourself.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think this is one of your amendments, Anna.  If you remember, early on we created Anna's Bill of Rights to help you prevent situations like this one."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I keep telling you, if I don't like what's going on for any reason, I'll stop right away.  That's what the safe words are for.  Do you want to know what my safe word is?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Doctor?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  If I yell out \"Doctor,\" Gray will stop whatever he is doing.  It will be okay.  You'll see.", "input": "", "output": "When are you planning on doing this?"}, {"instruction": "We'll talk about it after we meet on Sunday.  But I want to do it as soon as possible.  I hate this murky area of indecision.  I'm getting very emotionally involved with Martin.  And before it's too late, I would like to know whether our relationship stands a chance.  It doesn't mean that we will have to do it this way every time we make love.  But I want to know that, once in awhile, I will be interested in pleasing him in a way that really turns him on.  I think I'm doing a very smart thing, Doctor, by figuring everything out first before allowing this relationship to progress any further.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I'm very worried that you'll end up hurt by this exploration.  I have nothing against S&M as a sexual practice between people who desire to practice it.  But S&M is not something that you were ever attracted to.  I do believe that you are attracted to some of the role playing and theatrics that come with it, and I think you might even find that part sexual rewarding.  But I believe that actually inflicting and submitting to pain will be emotionally and physically devastating to you.  I wish you'd reconsider your decision, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I couldn't agree more with you, Doctor.  I do love the theatrics of it all.  And about the other stuff, I'll only know through experimentation.  If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.  It won't be the first time in my life when a relationship with someone I liked a lot didn't work out.  That's what I have you for, Doctor.  You'll make it all better.  If I didn't have you, I might not be as brave to try things as I can under your care.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, you're succeeding in making me feel like our sessions might be a bad thing for you."}, {"instruction": "Oh no, Doctor.  Please just relax.  Everything is okay.  You'll see.  Things will work out.  Anyway, I've got to go.  I'll call you if something happens.", "input": "", "output": "Please think everything through before you do anything, Anna.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure thing, you know me.  I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week.  Please call me if you want to talk."}, {"instruction": "I will.  I promise.  Don't worry, Doctor.  Bye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.   Sorry I'm so late.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  Could you please call next time?"}, {"instruction": "I almost didn't show up today.", "input": "", "output": "Why?  Are you hurt?  If that son of a bitch...you don't have to explain what happened to a doctor when you seek medical help.  You don't have to feel embarrassed.  Just go in and let your doctor look at your wounds."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, relax.  I didn't do anything yet.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't?  But you said last time that..."}, {"instruction": "I just said that I was going to meet him.", "input": "", "output": "So you didn't..."}, {"instruction": "Get whipped?", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Kathy introduced me to Gray last Sunday, just as I described--during the S&M flea-market.  He seems like a very nice guy.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "No, really.  He is a thirty-two-year-old graduate student at Berkeley.", "input": "", "output": "What is he studying?"}, {"instruction": "I think he is an anthropology student.", "input": "", "output": "Perfect."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, that's why I didn't think it was a good idea to come today.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Your attitude!  You're obviously against this whole thing.  You're clearly over-reacting.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Anna.  I just imagined you hurt--you're right.  I did over-react.  I won't let it happen again.  Now do you want to tell me about your meeting with Gray?"}, {"instruction": "That's better.  Well, let me see.  He is very good-looking.  That sort of surprised me a bit.", "input": "", "output": "Why?  Did you expect someone ugly?"}, {"instruction": "No, not ugly.  Just sort of someone unimpressive, you know what I mean?  And Gray is certainly impressive looking.", "input": "", "output": "You said that he was nice.  Did you have an opportunity to talk with him?"}, {"instruction": "The three of us when out to lunch together and talked.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy went with you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Gray has a very commanding presence.  I was even intimidated by him a bit at first.  Kathy came along to act as a social catalyst of sorts.", "input": "", "output": "That's very nice of Kathy.  So what's so commanding about Gray?  His personality?"}, {"instruction": "It's his whole way of being--his mannerisms, his style, his way of expressing himself.  You feel like he is always in control of the situation.  I could see how women would surrender themselves to him.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like surrendering yourself to Gray?"}, {"instruction": "I'm involved, Doctor.  All I'm asking Gray to do is to introduce me to what it's like being a bottom in an S&M relationship.  I'm not interested in him per se--just in his talents and his ability to show me the secret of pleasure from pain.  It's an educational thing.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Did you tell Martin about Gray?"}, {"instruction": "I told him that a friend of mine had found someone appropriate for me.  I didn't think it was a good idea to get into details.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?  Don't you have Martin's approval to get whipped by a strange man?"}, {"instruction": "Gray is no longer a stranger to me.  I interviewed him and I think he is going to be a very good teacher.  There is no reason why my S&M teacher should be unattractive or sexually unappealing to me, is there?  If I'm going to go through the experience of S&M erotica, it might as well be with someone I find stimulating in that way.", "input": "", "output": "So you're attracted to Gray?"}, {"instruction": "You can say that.", "input": "", "output": "And you don't want to tell Martin about Gray because of the sexual attraction you feel for Gray, right?"}, {"instruction": "Why torture the man?  I'm doing all this for our benefit--mine and Martin's.  He knows that.  Martin is being very supportive of me on this issue.  And by the way...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Gray is very supportive too.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy and I explained the whole situation to him over lunch.  We talked about Martin and what he is into.  Then I tried to convey to Gray why I was interested in his services.  You know, this guy really took the time to talk to us and to understand my needs and wishes.", "input": "", "output": "That's nice."}, {"instruction": "Well, it was.  Gray didn't have to do any of it.  When he gives lessons at the S&M techniques seminars, there are dozens of people who line up to volunteer to be his bottom for the demonstrations.  This guy has tons of people just dying to be whipped by him.  I really do think that it was nice of Gray to do this for me.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh.  And so when is Gray going to privately tutor you in the arts of S&M?"}, {"instruction": "Tomorrow night, after work.  I'll meet him over at his place at around 9 o'clock.", "input": "", "output": "Why his place?"}, {"instruction": "Because he has a dungeon, of course!  Did you think we were going to do it over at my apartment?  What would the neighbors think?", "input": "", "output": "That you brought home a nice, educated boy.  And good-looking too."}, {"instruction": "Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "You're doing it again--the ironic stuff designed to make me change my mind.  Well, I'm not going to.", "input": "", "output": "I wish you would give it a lot of thought."}, {"instruction": "Do you think I've been thinking of something else this week?  If you were going to be initiated into the pleasures of sexual pain, would you be thinking about whether you paid your bills this month?  Or something equally mundane?", "input": "", "output": "Fortunately, I'm not faced with the prospect of being whipped tomorrow."}, {"instruction": "It's not like some dreaded horror that's weighing on my mind either.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Then you'll have a very good night's sleep tonight."}, {"instruction": "I'll try!  But I am a little excited.", "input": "", "output": "Look, since I clearly can't change your mind..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, please!  Stop being so angry with me.  I'll be all right.  It's not like I'm setting myself up to be attacked in a blind alley or something.  I can always make him stop.  Please don't worry.", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "I know the thought of me being whipped will be weighing heavily on your mind.  And I really appreciate it.  I can't tell you just how much it means to me, in fact.", "input": "", "output": "Will you call me if anything goes wrong?"}, {"instruction": "Absolutely.  And I even promise to seek medical help, if I feel the necessity.", "input": "", "output": "Okay then, I'll see you next week.  Good luck tomorrow, Anna.  I hope you find what you're looking for."}, {"instruction": "I will.  And I'll tell you all about it soon.  I promise.  See you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I almost forgot.  Here is another one of Martin's masterpieces.", "input": "", "output": "Oh look.  It has a head."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  Oh god..."}, {"instruction": "Don't freak out, Doctor.  The neck-brace and the lump on my forehead are actually my fault.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  So what happened?"}, {"instruction": "You don't mind if I stand today, do you Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "No, go ahead and do what's most comfortable for you, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.  I'm a bit sore.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Is that your fault as well?"}, {"instruction": "In a manner of thinking.", "input": "", "output": "Hurting a bit from the whipping?"}, {"instruction": "Actually more like a lot.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Would you be more comfortable lying down?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't think so.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So would you like to tell me what happened to you or do you want me to guess?"}, {"instruction": "No, I think I would rather tell you. The idea of you trying to guess scares me a bit.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "Please look at me nicely, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I beg your pardon?"}, {"instruction": "You have this look on your face; I feel bad enough as it is.", "input": "", "output": "Sorry, Anna.  I'm just very concerned."}, {"instruction": "So let me start by saying that you were right.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was a very stupid idea.  Ouch!", "input": "", "output": "What's wrong?"}, {"instruction": "It hurts to lean on the window this way.", "input": "", "output": "May I suggest not leaning on the window?"}, {"instruction": "Be nice to me, Doctor.  I'm having problems maintaining my outwardly normal composure as it is.", "input": "", "output": "I can see that.  Why don't you try telling me what happened last Friday?  That's a good starting point, isn't it?"}, {"instruction": "As I said, you were absolutely right and I shouldn't have done what I did.", "input": "", "output": "Did Gray hurt you?"}, {"instruction": "I wish it was that simple.  I mean it did hurt.  When he was lashing me with his whip, it hurt a lot.  But I was prepared for that and...that's not really the problem.", "input": "", "output": "What happened, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "It was unbelievably emotional, Doctor.  I was really unprepared for feeling that way.", "input": "", "output": "How did you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Well, let me start at the beginning.  I drove up to Gray's house late Friday evening, a bit later than we originally planned.  He lives South of Market and I got a bit lost driving to his place.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy didn't go with you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I didn't think it was appropriate.  She knew that I was going there and if anything...well, you understand.", "input": "", "output": "No.  What do you mean."}, {"instruction": "Well, Kathy was my silent partner.  If she didn't hear from me the next morning, she was supposed to come and get me.  She was my safety net.", "input": "", "output": "I understand, but why the next morning?  Why so late?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't like Gray was a total stranger.  And I somehow felt that having Kathy wait for my call at night wasn't appropriate--she wouldn't get any sleep and I felt that I was going to miss out on something.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "That night was about doing something dangerous.  I didn't want to take away from that feeling.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "When I got to Gray's, he yelled at me for being late.  He said that he expects his bottoms to be on time.  I was so shocked by his attitude that I almost left.  But he ordered me to take off my clothes and follow him.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "I had to.  I stripped off right there in his front hall.  Everything had to come off including the leather corset I got just for that occasion--Gray wouldn't let me keep it on.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "I was not allowed to ask.  He made me march upstairs into a large attic space that was converted into a dungeon.  It was a very strange place.  All the lighting was located on the floor at either end of the room where the slanted walls that formed the roof met the floor.  The lighting made these very extreme shadows.  It was almost like when we were kids and we'd hold flashlights under our faces while telling a ghost story, but even more so.  In the middle of the room there was a post.  Gray took my wrists and tied them way over my head to the notches in the post.  Then he made me spread my legs apart and tied each foot to a ring in the floor.  I felt completely helpless.  I didn't mind my arms being tied down like that.  But having my legs spread apart was a very strange sensation.", "input": "", "output": "Can you describe it?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know exactly.  I think that women are just used to keeping their legs together.  There are only a few opportunities during life's normal activities where you'd have your legs pulled apart like that.", "input": "", "output": "Was it a pleasurable experience?"}, {"instruction": "It made me feel very much out of control.  It made Gray bigger somehow, towering over me.  I felt like he could do anything to me.  It was very exciting.", "input": "", "output": "So you liked being tied down?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, actually a lot.  I got extremely wet waiting for Gray to get ready.  There was a slight draft in the room from this window at one end.  The window was closed, but I could feel the cold air giving me a chill on the wetness spreading down my inner thighs.", "input": "", "output": "Gray tied you up and left you alone?"}, {"instruction": "Oh no.  He was in the room.  I watched him take out all these S&M toys and carefully lay them out onto this table.  And I was perfectly comfortable.  The knots on my wrists and feet didn't hurt.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Gray then stripped off his shirt.  He was wearing these tight black leather pants. These were really tight.  I could watch as he was getting turned on by me and what he was doing.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I was facing the window and could see the entire downtown and the Bay Bridge.  It was quite beautiful.", "input": "", "output": "No curtains?"}, {"instruction": "There was no need--no one could see us.  This was a pretty isolated part of town, especially at night and Gray even told me that I was free to be as loud as I was wanted to be--no one would hear.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "After what felt like a very long time, Gray approached me with this long black leather whip with braided ends.  He caressed my skin with the whip, playing it across my arms and chest.  I was so keyed-up from anticipation that I was ready to beg him to whip me.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "I couldn't--it was so exciting I felt breathless and couldn't utter a sound.  Gray moved the whip between my thighs and I could feel the wet leather as it came out across my ass.  And then suddenly he hit.  It was a lot more painful then I imagined it was going to be.  I thought it was going to sting, but this really hurt.", "input": "", "output": "Did you want him to stop at that point?"}, {"instruction": "I had gotten so far, I didn't want to stop then.  He gave me two more lashes and then stopped.  I had my eyes closed and couldn't see what he was doing, so I braced myself for more.  But Gray told me to open my eyes--he moved a large mirror so that I could see myself from the side.  He told me to look as he raised the whip and hit me across the back again.  It was both frightening and arousing at the same time.  He ordered me to thank him for his attentions, but I still couldn't talk.  He hit me again.  And then something happened. I got my voice back and could hear myself screaming, a really high pitch scream like in a horror movie.  He hit me twice more.  I could see how turned on he was in the mirror.  He told me that he was going to fuck my face now.  To my horror, I could feel my mouth water at the suggestion.", "input": "", "output": "I thought that you only wanted the experience of being whipped?"}, {"instruction": "I know.  But I was really overwhelmed.  I wanted to suck him so bad.  Before I knew it, or really even had time to think about it, I was on my knees in front of Gray with my arms still tied together and...", "input": "", "output": "Do you regret what you did?"}, {"instruction": "It was the first time in my life that I cheated on someone.", "input": "", "output": "You mean Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I still can't believe that I'm capable of doing something like that to someone I cared so much about.  When I was driving home from Gray's that night, I felt this horrible shame.  But then I got very angry.  This was all Martin's fault!  He actually encouraged me to go out and seek sexual satisfaction with another man.  Martin and I haven't even had sex yet!", "input": "", "output": "So are you feeling guilty?"}, {"instruction": "No!  I feel angry.  I think Martin knowingly drove me to commit infidelity.  If it wasn't for him, I would still be the kind of person who would never ever cheat on a lover.", "input": "", "output": "Did you speak to Martin about this?"}, {"instruction": "When I got home, there was a message from him on my answering machine.  He wanted to know how it went.  So I picked up the phone and let him know!", "input": "", "output": "I see.  How did Martin take it?"}, {"instruction": "The bastard was just fine about it!  I mean how can he care about me if he wants me to sleep with other men?  Anyway, you'll be relieved to know that Martin and I are no longer together.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I spent the weekend with Kathy nursing my wounds.  She is a great nurse.", "input": "", "output": "How did you injure your neck and head?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, right.  I had a car accident.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I was driving to Kathy's place the next day, but I was too sore to really sit down in the seat.  So I was trying to drive while sort of standing up.  Anyway, it didn't work really well.  San Francisco's roads are so steep anyway...well, there was this bump and I hit a streetlight.", "input": "", "output": "Streetlight?"}, {"instruction": "The streetlight was fine.  But I hit the windshield with my head and then smashed back into the driver's seat really hard--hence the whiplash.", "input": "", "output": "Did you see a doctor?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy took me to the emergency room.  I'm all right, just a bit sore.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  I guess it could have been worse."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know.  I didn't even get amnesia or something out of it.  Wouldn't that be great?  \"Doctor, I just don't know why I have these bruises on my back.\"", "input": "", "output": "You're bruised?"}, {"instruction": "Oh...you want to see?", "input": "", "output": "No, I can imagine."}, {"instruction": "No, it's no problem.  Here.  It looks worse then it feels, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Put your shirt back on."}, {"instruction": "Look, it's late.  I'm going to go home.  It was a hard week.  You can't imagine how it is to go to work like this.  My job requires sitting.  I have to go to elaborate measures to avoid it.", "input": "", "output": "How did you explain this at work?"}, {"instruction": "I said that I was in a car accident.  People were very sympathetic actually.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Take care of yourself, Anna."}, {"instruction": "You keep saying that, Doctor.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  How are you feeling?  How's the healing process going?"}, {"instruction": "Fine.", "input": "", "output": "I see you're no longer wearing the neck brace and your forehead is looking much much better."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  How are the bruises on your back?"}, {"instruction": "Fine.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Did you speak with Martin last week?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Did he try to contact you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?  Did he try to call you or not?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Did he leave messages on your machine?"}, {"instruction": "I canceled my answering service.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  May I ask why you did that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want to talk to people.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Do you answer the phone if someone calls while you're at home?"}, {"instruction": "No.  If I need to speak with someone, I can call them myself.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  So if I need to reach you, for example, I'm simply out of luck?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Well, these are some drastic changes in your life style.  Can you tell me what motivated you to become a hermit?"}, {"instruction": "I just don't want to talk to anyone now.", "input": "", "output": "You're talking to me.  Barely, actually."}, {"instruction": "I just feel so...so ashamed of myself.", "input": "", "output": "Why?  What happened to you, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "You know.  You know everything, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Are you feeling bad about your S&M encounter?"}, {"instruction": "I feel like I've been branded for life!", "input": "", "output": "The bruises on your back will go away and in a few weeks you wouldn't even be able to tell that there was anything there.  What happened, Anna?  When you left here last week, you felt hurt but mostly you felt anger toward Martin for placing you in a bad situation.  But now you're barely speaking in full sentences.  Did something happened that I don't know about?"}, {"instruction": "Oh god, I was angry.  I was very angry at Martin.  He changed me.  And I don't like the person that I've become.  But as that anger faded, I felt like I was coming out of this fog that was clouding my brain, my judgment.  What right do I have to be angry with Martin?  He didn't do anything.  He just told me about his perversions and I listened.  And then I was the one that went out and actively sought them out and tried to experience them.  And what's more, I liked it.  Now, I'm the kind of woman that likes being beaten and forced into having sex with a man she barely knows.", "input": "", "output": "Hold on, Anna.  You wanted to experience something before doing it to your lover.  Now you know.  That's all."}, {"instruction": "But I liked it.  Don't you see, Doctor?  I'm the kind of person that likes that sort of thing.", "input": "", "output": "What I remember from our last session is that you thought that it really hurt to get whipped.  My impression was that you didn't enjoy that part of the evening at all.  Don't you remember?"}, {"instruction": "But I let him do it to me.  And afterwards I even thanked him for his time and attention.", "input": "", "output": "That's part of the S&M ritual, that's all.  You were doing what you thought was expected of you, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But I was turned on.  I wanted to suck him off before Gray asked...commanded me to do it.", "input": "", "output": "I think you were mostly turned on by the helplessness of your situation--your arms tied above your head and your legs spread eagle and tied to the rings in the floor.  There are a lot of women who find that sexually stimulating."}, {"instruction": "There are women who find beating to be sexually stimulating, too.", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  But I don't think you're one of them."}, {"instruction": "How do you know?  You weren't there.", "input": "", "output": "You described the encounter in some detail to me, Anna.  And I've also developed a pretty good idea of who you are as a person over the last ten months of therapy.  So let's talk about what's really bothering you.  You said that you felt shame.  Tell me specifically when and why you feel this way."}, {"instruction": "Almost all the time.  I walk around SII and I feel like everyone can tell.", "input": "", "output": "Can tell what?"}, {"instruction": "Can tell that I'm this inferior creature.", "input": "", "output": "Inferior in what way?"}, {"instruction": "I like...I want and need to be dominated by a man.  I need to be submissive. I can't respond to other people as equals.", "input": "", "output": "Of course you can.  You did so all your life.  That hasn't changed just because you participated in what was really a role-playing situation for you.  It was just role-playing for you, remember?  You said yourself that it was more about pretending and fantasy then anything else.  Remember?  I'm just repeating your own words."}, {"instruction": "I remember.  But that was before, when it was all just speculation.  Now, things are different.", "input": "", "output": "How are they different?"}, {"instruction": "It's not just talk any more.", "input": "", "output": "Are you planning on doing this again?"}, {"instruction": "I...I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to do this again?"}, {"instruction": "What if I can't help it?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "What if I can't help doing it again and again?  What if I'm really a bottom and just didn't know it before?", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you're a bottom?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  But when I walk down the street, people look at me differently now.", "input": "", "output": "How do they look at you?"}, {"instruction": "They can see that I'm inferior.  They look down on me.  I have to move out of people's way as I walk.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "I never have the right-of-way anymore.", "input": "", "output": "That's silly, Anna.  There are some very rude people on the streets Downtown especially during rush hour.  But their behavior is not about you.  It's about them and who they are.  Did something in particular happened to you that sparked this feeling of inferiority?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I just woke up one morning and couldn't bare to look at myself anymore.  I felt dirty, disgusting.  It felt gross just to touch my own skin.  I got into the shower and stood there for about two hours.  It was all right under the water somehow.  But as soon as I got out, that feeling of being contaminated was back.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel this way now?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  It makes my hair stand on end.  It doesn't even go away at night when I sleep.", "input": "", "output": "What happens when you sleep?"}, {"instruction": "I have these dreams.", "input": "", "output": "Do you remember any of them?"}, {"instruction": "Not all of them.  But I know they were bad, even if I don't remember them after waking.", "input": "", "output": "Can you tell me a dream that you remember?"}, {"instruction": "There was this dream I had just before I got up this morning.  I'm not sure if it was responsible for waking me up, but...", "input": "", "output": "What was is it about?"}, {"instruction": "It was very short. The dream started with my mother and me looking down at the blood left on the cutting board after the butchering of the dinner meat.   My mother and I made dinner together, but it was my mother that cooked the meat that night.  By the time the dream started, we had already had our dinner.  Somehow, I knew all this information--it wasn't really part of the imagery of the dream.  What I saw in the dream was the raw blood itself on the cutting board.  My mother was leaning next to me.  I could feel her presence near me more then I could actually see her.  All I saw was the blood.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "That's not the bad part.  In the blood, we could clearly see these things moving around.  They were shaped like tiny black sperms and wiggled through the blood  like sperm.  They were parasites.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "No.  My mother made the meat rare--these things were alive inside the meat when we ate it!", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "It was a very short dream--just images of the blood on the board with these things in it, the feeling of mother's head close to mine, and the shared knowledge that we ate contaminated meat for dinner.", "input": "", "output": "You said that you awoke right after this dream.  How often do these dreams wake you up?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  But I've been sleeping very poorly the last couple of weeks, although I didn't start having these dreams until this past weekend.", "input": "", "output": "I think you need to get some rest, Anna.  You had a very stressful couple of weeks--the S&M night, the break-up with Martin, the car accident, the physical traumas. You need to get some rest.  I think you'll be able to look at your situation from a whole different perspective once you get the sleep your body so desperately needs.  Do you still have some of that melatonin left?  It really worked well for you in the past."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I think I still have some.", "input": "", "output": "Take some when you get home tonight.  And if you can, call in sick tomorrow--I want you to get some rest.  Maybe you should consider driving up to see your parents over the weekend.  That always seems to help.  What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "My car is still in the shop.", "input": "", "output": "Can you rent one?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so.  Maybe you're right.  I should go and visit my mom and dad.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  And call me if you feel like things are getting out of control.  Don't wait so long next time, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay then, I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "And Anna, get your answering service back, please."}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Goodbye then.  Have a good weekend with your parents.  Relax and get some sleep--doctor's orders."}, {"instruction": "Mmm.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I know that I'm your Doctor.  But we also have this other bond between us, a bond which we've both worked hard to suppress so that I could keep being your therapist.  And it has to stay that way.  But I want you to understand something.  I think of you as really something very amazingly special and in no way inferior.  And even if you decide that you are sexually attracted towards some aspects of S&M, it won't change my opinion at all."}, {"instruction": "Oh Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  You look much better today.  How are you feeling?"}, {"instruction": "Better.  I followed your advice and went home for the weekend.  Funny, it's been years since I lived with my parents and I still call visiting them \"going home.\"", "input": "", "output": "That's where you grew up; you spent most of your life there.  It would be more unusual if you didn't feel at home there at least on some level."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I feel fortunate.  Some people don't have that.  Kathy doesn't.  Her mother died when she was still a little girl.  And after her father remarried, she never felt that sense of being home in his house.  I feel sorry for her.  I would hate to be so utterly alone in the world.  Sometimes, I imagine what it will be like when my parents die--it will happen some day.", "input": "", "output": "It's unfortunate, but true."}, {"instruction": "My stomach turns cold, like there is a large piece of ice in there.  I feel an overwhelming sense of dread.  At those times, I have to remind myself that they are still alive and everything is okay and I don't have to worry.  But I know it's looming somewhere out there on the time horizon.  I hope it's way far out.", "input": "", "output": "I hope so too.  Did you have a good weekend with your parents?"}, {"instruction": "It was a bit strange.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "They were very concerned about my injuries.  I had told them about the car accident on the phone.  But my mom really freaked when she saw me.", "input": "", "output": "You were wearing your neck brace?"}, {"instruction": "No, I wasn't.  But the thing on my forehead is still visible and it was worse when I went up there.  Plus I was taking all these pain killers...", "input": "", "output": "You didn't tell me that before.  What were you taking?"}, {"instruction": "Vicodins--they were prescribed to me by the doctor in the emergency room.  I've been taking them for almost three weeks now, although not as much now as before.  That stuff was really making me stoned.  I felt so edgy and I couldn't sleep.  And it was very hard getting my work done.  But they did take the edge off the pain.  But it was strange, really--what the drugs seemed to do was make me forget about my neck, but as soon as I thought about the pain, it hurt as much as before.  It's like it stopped me from concentrating on the pain, rather than actually getting rid of it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Usually Vicodin would make you drowsy, but I've heard of patients who couldn't sleep.  Vicodin is a narcotic and I don't think it's a very good one.  I'm against prescribing it to patients with pain problems.  Although it is a Category 3 narcotic, doctors like to precribe it because it is a dysphoric--it makes you feel bad, so its potential for abuse is somewhat lower than some Category 2 narcotics like Percocet.  That's the depression and edginess you said you were experiencing.  Your dejected mood of the past week could easily be explained by the fact that you've been taking this medication.  You said that you are still taking it but less so than before?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe only one pill in the evening--it's still very uncomfortable after a full day of moving around.  Mostly, it's the headaches from the pain in the neck. My neck gets very stiff after a while and that translates into a headache by the end of the day.", "input": "", "output": "Taking one pill is not so bad, though I wish you'd try to stick to over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen.  Do you feel that the depression you were experiencing last week is getting better?"}, {"instruction": "The world does seem a bit brighter.  Last week, it felt like someone just hit me with a load of bricks, psychologically speaking.  I still feel very uncomfortable about my S&M night, but I no longer think that people can tell what I did just by looking at me--people on the streets are just rude bastards again, and not out to dominate me by refusing me the right of way and pushing me off the edge of the sidewalks.  That whole thing was just a bit paranoid of me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you've been able to gain some perspective."}, {"instruction": "But I'm still horrified that I found that experience pleasurable on any level.", "input": "", "output": "Try to sort out exactly what aspects of that night were exciting to you.  As we talked about it last week, the actual pain that you felt from the whip didn't turn you on at all."}, {"instruction": "I know.  It was more about being helpless--being tied down and not in a position to help myself.  I thought a lot about that night, reliving it in my head over and over again.  When I fell asleep, I'd have dreams about it.  In the dreams, my dominant partner is this gigantic figure towering over me.  His breathing is like a hot wind on my back.  I long to move--my whole body trembles with excitement--but the restraints on my legs and wrists keep me firmly in place.  Only my hips can sort of sway back and forth.  The closer my top comes to me, the more excited I feel.", "input": "", "output": "Is Gray the dominant man in your dreams?"}, {"instruction": "I actually don't know who it was.  In the dream, I have a blindfold with just a tiny slit though which I can see shadows of the figure behind me on the wall.  But it's definitely that attic dungeon in Gray's house.  The dreams are very intense and very real.", "input": "", "output": "Do you experience orgasms during these dreams?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I get almost unbearably aroused during the dream and desperately want to have an orgasm, but my top won't let me.", "input": "", "output": "How does he stop you?"}, {"instruction": "He hits me and everything just goes away until he builds it up again.  This happens over and over again.  In the dream, I practically beg him to let me come.  But...this all makes me feel very perverse.", "input": "", "output": "These are just fantasies."}, {"instruction": "Well, I did try it out for real.  I told Kathy about the dreams.  She thought they were very sexy.  She even made me a bit uncomfortable about telling her.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy went with me.", "input": "", "output": "Went where?  To your parents?"}, {"instruction": "She drove me there and spent the weekend with me.  My parents didn't mind having an extra guest.  And I have a queen size bed in my room, so there wasn't a problem with sleeping arrangements.", "input": "", "output": "You and Kathy shared a bed?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  It felt sort of like pajama party--when I was little, I would have these all-girl overnight parties.  We'd talk about boys and some such stuff.  I learned about periods that way.", "input": "", "output": "Menstruation?"}, {"instruction": "One girl got hers very early, and we all talked about the unfairness of evolution and biology for being stuck with such an unpleasant thing for most of our lives.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Actually, I don't think you do.  You never had one.  They are really very unpleasant, to say the least.", "input": "", "output": "I have to say that I've never suffered from menstruation envy.  So how did Kathy make you feel uncomfortable?"}, {"instruction": "It was late at night, we were both lying in my bed, and I was telling her about my dreams.  She was very supportive and told me that she didn't think I was a bad person for having them.  Then she said that she thought the dreams were very exciting.", "input": "", "output": "And that made you feel uncomfortable?"}, {"instruction": "A little...", "input": "", "output": "It's always exciting to hear other people's fantasies..."}, {"instruction": "You don't understand, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "She opened up the covers, lifted up her t-shirt and pulled down her panties and...I never seen a woman do that before.  I mean, I do it, but...I felt very uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I wanted to tell you that I did get my answering service back.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  And do you answer the phone now when it rings?"}, {"instruction": "Not all the time.  But I do listen to my messages.  Martin's been calling relentlessly.  I wish he'd just leave me alone.  That part is the worst of all.  I have so many mixed emotions--I cheated on him, and yet he pushed me to do it.  It's all very confusing and very difficult to sort through, especially stoned on pain killers.", "input": "", "output": "We can work on that here."}, {"instruction": "I know.  And thank you for telling me what you did last time.  I can't tell you just how much it meant to me.", "input": "", "output": "It was all true.  But I wish we would stay away from that topic for obvious reasons."}, {"instruction": "I know. I just...look what time it is.  I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Next week, then.  Have a good weekend, Anna."}, {"instruction": "You too, Doctor.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  How's your neck?  Still hurts?"}, {"instruction": "You have a very nice way of asking if I'm still taking pain killers.  The answer is yes, it does hurt.  But no, I'm not taking them any more.  Happy?", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I'm very happy to hear that, Anna.  But why are you so confrontational today?"}, {"instruction": "Am I?  I'm sorry, Doctor.  I had a long day.  And night.  I came to work yesterday and haven't been home since.", "input": "", "output": "Deadline?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  And Jules is getting angry with me for missing a lot of days and generally not being there when I am there.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that."}, {"instruction": "He'll get over it.  But I'll have to work really hard for a while.  You know, Doctor, most women I know who carry underwear in their purse, do it because they plan to have a good time with their dates that night.  I do it because I know I might end up sleeping in a sleeping bag under my desk.", "input": "", "output": "Under the desk?"}, {"instruction": "The keep the overhead lights on all night at SII because of the janitorial staff and because there's always someone working through the night in the building.  I can't sleep with that much light.  But under the desk...it's not terrific anyway.", "input": "", "output": "How was your week otherwise?  Anything new from Martin?"}, {"instruction": "He still calls at least once a day.  Sometimes I'm tempted to answer the phone and talk to him.  But I haven't yet.  I think I might be getting over him.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that."}, {"instruction": "I know you are, Doctor.  As for the rest of the week, I saw my parents and grandmother on Mother's Day.  It was very nice.  They took me out for brunch at the Redwood Room in the Clift Hotel.  Very nice.  You should check it out some time.", "input": "", "output": "I've been there.  It is nice."}, {"instruction": "And pretty much the rest of the time, I just spent thinking.  Don't get scared, Doctor.  I was just thinking, not doing anything.", "input": "", "output": "What were you thinking about?"}, {"instruction": "I'm the only child in my family.  My parents tried to have more, but it just never happened.  My dad always wanted to have a son.  When it became obvious that wasn't meant to be, he transferred his boy-raising energy onto me.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "He pretty much raised me as he would have raised a boy.  I always felt like I could do anything I wished with my life.  I was never made to believe that being a girl would somehow be limiting to me in my choice of career or lifestyle.  My parents weren't feminists or anything--it wasn't about politics.  It's just that the issue of gender was always sort of irrelevant.  You see?", "input": "", "output": "I do.  This is what you were thinking about this week?"}, {"instruction": "What I'm trying to say, Doctor, is that I was raised to believe that there are no major differences between the mental abilities of men and women.  I mean, there are some, but they don't prevent a person from doing what he or she wants to do with their lives.", "input": "", "output": "I agree with that.  But what's your point?"}, {"instruction": "The point is that I believe and base my life on the premise that men and women are equal.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "You don't understand, Doctor.  If all this is true, then how can I possibly find anything appealing or attractive about being subservient to a man?", "input": "", "output": "You are talking about your reaction to being dominated and tied down during sex?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I liked it.  I really like it.  It was very exciting and sexually stimulating.  But it goes against all my principles, really.  I don't like to boss people around and don't like it when people do it to me.  So why this stupid fascination with masochism?", "input": "", "output": "The desire conflicts with your egalitarian politics?"}, {"instruction": "I wish I could just stuff that desire somewhere deep down in my psyche so that it would never rear its ugly head as long as I live.", "input": "", "output": "You know, Anna, you are not the only woman in the world who enjoys being dominated by a man during sex."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I know that, Doctor.  I've been to the S&M club.  I've seen a lot of them, remember?", "input": "", "output": "That's not exactly what I meant.  I'm not just talking about people who've identified themselves as S&M practitioners.  I'm talking about people, both men and women, across the board.  The range of sexual submissiveness includes women who are passive in bed to women who are excited by rape fantasies to women who enjoy losing control during a sexual encounter.  And just because a person enjoys the feeling of powerlessness and submission during sex, it does not mean that same person would tolerate the same behavior during other aspects of their lives."}, {"instruction": "You mean the woman who likes the rape fantasy wouldn't want to be raped.", "input": "", "output": "Right.  There's a difference between a fantasy and reality.  The woman who gets turned on being a sex slave in the bedroom may go out and engineer a hostile takeover in the boardroom."}, {"instruction": "Yeah?", "input": "", "output": "And just because a woman lets a man tie her down during sex and dominate her, she might not let him make the decision about where they are going to go for dinner, or what car they are going to buy, or any other aspect of their lives together.  I knew one couple where the man appeared to be completely submissive to his wife--she totally dominated him in every aspect of their lives.  He would hardly even speak when she was in the room--she talked for both of them.  But in the bedroom, he was the master and she was his slave.  That's what she liked and that's what worked for both of them.  It wasn't about sexual politics.  It was about meeting each other's sexual needs."}, {"instruction": "I feel a traitor to my sex, though. I've read about how women were abused throughout history--how they've been used as sex toys and how they've been tortured and raped by vicious men.  And that conduct was tolerated.  And now, if I like something like that done to me, it's like I am saying it was okay for that to happen to them, too.  Do you see?", "input": "", "output": "I think I see what you're saying.  But I don't think your consensual sexual conduct has anything to do with torture and rape of women who have not given their consent.  You shouldn't equate the two."}, {"instruction": "It feels intrinsically wrong to allow a man to treat me in such a degrading fashion, even if it is consensual.  And yet...you see my dilemma, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "You are not the first woman to feel this way.  These are common issues with which people in the S&M community have to come to terms.  And you might be surprised to know that it's not just submissives who have these guilt feelings.  Dominants too, especially those who are inflicting pain, are doing something to other people that society says is wrong.  It is not uncommon for a dominant to feel anxiety and even deep depression over their desire to physically abuse others.  But consent is the key.  If a person is free to walk away, then it's about pleasure and not about abuse."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I know that what you're saying makes perfect sense.  But somehow, deep down inside, these desires still feel wrong in some basic way.", "input": "", "output": "This is something that you'll need to figure out. Can you enjoy your sexual interests without infusing them with guilt?  If the guilt is too strong, it will ruin those experiences anyway."}, {"instruction": "That's essentially what Kathy said.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?  You talked to Kathy about this?"}, {"instruction": "I was just venting my frustrations to her.  Caren and Greg are getting married.", "input": "", "output": "That's nice.  It's been a long time since you mentioned anything about them."}, {"instruction": "Well, we sort of drifted apart after Martin came into the picture.  That's another thing I can hate him for.  But Caren is just too straight to understand what I've been going through lately.", "input": "", "output": "Have you tried?"}, {"instruction": "Tried what?  Telling her that I enjoy being whipped?", "input": "", "output": "You don't.  You like playing the submissive and being tied down during sex. That's different."}, {"instruction": "It still doesn't sound great.  But in any case, they finally decided to get married.  Apparently, they decided in February and they are sending out invitations now for their wedding in June.  Can you believe it?  She didn't even tell me that she got engaged.  We had always agreed to be each other's maids of honor or matrons, depending on who got married first.  And now she didn't even tell me she was engaged.  She just sent me an invitation.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you should talk to Caren and try to patch-up your relationship, if it's still important to you."}, {"instruction": "She's the only person who stayed with me through the years.  I would hate to lose her over a guy.", "input": "", "output": "Talk to her.  She might feel the same way.  And you don't have to disclose anything to her that you don't think would be appropriate"}, {"instruction": "True.  You know, I'll be 27 soon.  That's almost a third of a lifetime.  And I still can't figure it out.  Pathetic!", "input": "", "output": "I'm 37 and I'm not married.  I don't think of myself as a bad person because of that."}, {"instruction": "No, just available.  I bet women are lining up at your door.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, we've crossed over into the danger zone.  But fortunately we're out of time for today, Anna.  Don't be too hard on yourself.  Part of being a liberated woman is to be exactly the person that you want to be."}, {"instruction": "An interesting thought, Doctor.  I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  You're looking better today."}, {"instruction": "I feel better.  I've been thinking a lot about what we talked about last time.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "I like what you said at the end--that part of being a liberated woman is to be free to be the person that I want to be.  I think that based on that definition, there aren't a whole lot of truly liberated women in the world today.  But I can still try to grant myself permission to enjoy something unconventional based on that principle.", "input": "", "output": "That's very good.  And by the way, men have to live by a socially acceptable set of rules as well.  When men venture outside the social norm, it's just as difficult for them to come to terms with that as it is for you to accept the fact that you might enjoy socially controversial sexual activities."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.  I guess that's true.  Martin is clearly having a hell of a time trying to figure out his passions.  He's been completely ostracized from the S&M community in Michigan.", "input": "", "output": "You talked with Martin?"}, {"instruction": "No.  But he leaves very detailed messages and I feel like I'm completely caught-up on his life problems.  But I haven't spoken to him or left him a message or anything.", "input": "", "output": "But you listen to all his messages?"}, {"instruction": "I tried to just skip and delete them in the beginning.  But I find that difficult.  Martin is still like an open wound and, while I know that listening to his messages probably makes it much more difficult to get over him, the sound of his voice is sort of soothing and brings some relief.", "input": "", "output": "I thought that since we weren't talking about Martin..."}, {"instruction": "That I gave up on him all together?", "input": "", "output": "Haven't you?"}, {"instruction": "Absolutely.  I have no interest in ever seeing that guy again.", "input": "", "output": "So why are you tormenting yourself?  Why are you listening?"}, {"instruction": "Because it's there.  Sometimes I delete the messages.  But I have the Pacific Bell messaging service and I find myself using it to retrieve my old deleted messages.  Sometimes I listen to them in the middle of the night.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, technology can be a hazard sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But it's not all that bad, Doctor.  I run into Bill now and then at SII.  That doesn't mean that I'm interested in getting back together with him, even though my whole body reacts to his presence--not in a sexual way, but just with fear and anxiety.", "input": "", "output": "What are you worried about when you see Bill?"}, {"instruction": "I just always want to leave him with an impression that I'm doing so much better now than I did when I was with him.  I want him to think that I look very good--hot, even.  I want him believe that I'm very smart and talented.  I even want him to be jealous.", "input": "", "output": "Jealous of whom?"}, {"instruction": "Of all the men that I could be seeing right now.  He doesn't know.  For all he knows, I might be having the time of my life with some super terrific guy who is better than him in every way.", "input": "", "output": "And why would he think that?"}, {"instruction": "I always try to look very happy and satisfied when Bill sees me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  And how often do you run into Bill nowadays?"}, {"instruction": "Unfortunately, he works on the same floor.", "input": "", "output": "So you see him a lot?"}, {"instruction": "Usually a couple of times a week.  The good thing is that the girl he was drooling over for a couple of months finally dumped him.  There are advantages and disadvantages to working with the same people you socialize with.  On one hand, it can be awfully convenient.  You get to see each other all the time and slip out for a quickie every now and then.", "input": "", "output": "Quickie?"}, {"instruction": "You know, a quickie.  But you also get to be around the people who you would rather see fall off the edge of the world or something.  I heard that's fairly common in technology companies.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But to get back to my life, Kathy took me to another S&M social last week.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "It was in Golden Gate Park and it was just a barbecue--no whips, no chains.  It was interesting to meet members of the community in another context.  Kathy took me so that I could talk to some of the women there.  She thought it would help me organize my thinking and feelings on the subject.", "input": "", "output": "And did it help?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  There were certainly women there who were highly respected professionals in their fields, but...", "input": "", "output": "But what?"}, {"instruction": "But...look, I'm not saying that this was true for all the women I met at that party, but there was something odd about a lot of those women.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by odd?"}, {"instruction": "I sort of got the feeling that some of those people were defining themselves through their practice of S&M.  I'm not sure I'm making myself clear.", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead, you're doing fine."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's like when someone asks me to tell a bit about myself.  I don't start off telling them how much I like to perform oral sex on men or anything.  I usually tell them what I do for a living, what sort of books I like, what I enjoy doing in my spare time.  Maybe I'd volunteer some background information like where I grew up, what school I went to, or tell them that I'm an only child or something.  But the people there were different.  For them, it seems, their affiliation and enjoyment of S&M is the dominant trait of their personalities.  Sure you can ask them about their work and books they read, but those are just sort of surface ripples.  What they're really about is S&M.  These people not only like to practice it, they like to talk about it, to watch it, to learn it, to...just everything.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't feel that way."}, {"instruction": "No.  While I like being tied down and dominated during sex, that's just a small part of who I am.  I don't define myself as a woman who likes to be submissive during sex.  I think of it as on a need to know basis kind of information.  I might let my boyfriend know about it, but...see what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "I think that's good.  I believe that type of pigeonholing limits one's perspective on life."}, {"instruction": "Exactly!  These people can only see the world from the point of view of practicing members of the S&M community.  Everything they do is somehow colored by that association.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But in some way, I sort of understand part of it.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "These people have to worry about being outside of the social norm.  They constantly have to defend themselves from outside criticisms.  Take for instance my first reaction to the S&M scene in Michigan.  I was horrified at what I saw and ended up calling the police.  These people probably have to worry about stuff like that all the time.  Imagine walking down a path in the woods or something and seeing a woman tied to a tree with her blouse ripped off and a man forcing himself on her.  Everyone's first reaction would be to help the woman.  The presumed villain might get punched out or worse a long time before either of them get to explain that they are performing a consensual act.", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  That's why S&M clubs have memberships and are very cautious about allowing outsiders into their parties."}, {"instruction": "Exactly.  And there are also the issues of using doctors that understand and won't throw your partner in jail if you ever need some medical attention.  Or, god forbid, having the social services take your children away because you're judged to be an unfit parent.  These people have to worry about all that.", "input": "", "output": "All of that is true."}, {"instruction": "But, even so, I'd think that these people have other interesting attributes to their personality than just their practice of S&M.  It seems so limiting.  It's almost like they live in the prison of their own desires.", "input": "", "output": "Very profound."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.  But I mean it.  Some of the members of this S&M club are extraordinary intelligent and also very nice.  But there's always this edge when you talk to them.  Well, it's not always true.  There were a few people at the barbecue that were not like that.  They seemed fairly normal.  But...you get the idea, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I do.  I'm glad that your passions for certain particular sexual experiences are not your defining characteristic.  So what conclusions did you come away with from that party?  I mean as relating to your lifestyle and to your feelings?"}, {"instruction": "I'm working on getting comfortable with my desires.  I'm beginning to believe that when I meet a man that I'm interested in dating and ask him to accommodate my interests, he won't be very much opposed to doing that.", "input": "", "output": "No, I suppose not."}, {"instruction": "Would you?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "You know--tie me down and...", "input": "", "output": "Anna!"}, {"instruction": "I'm just asking.  Okay, some other woman then.  Would you, Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "It's late, Anna.  I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "I bet you would.  And I bet you would be a very good lover, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  Are you going to sit down?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe.", "input": "", "output": "What's up?"}, {"instruction": "I'm in a very bad mood, Doctor.

I think it was him.  I was too busy hiding to really know.  But I think he's back.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to tell me what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Caren and Greg showed up at my door Saturday morning.  I guess Caren felt really bad about us drifting apart like that, so she dragged Greg to come see me and patch things up.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds very nice."}, {"instruction": "I'm glad she did it.  I was feeling really bad about losing her as a friend and I'm glad to know that she was suffering, too.  Greg, I think, was perfectly happy not hanging around me anymore--I was too weird for him--but Caren wouldn't let him.  So they took time off their busy wedding-planning schedule to take me out for a day and talk things back to normal, so to speak.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "We went to the Seal Rock Inn for brunch and then walked on the beach.  It was a very low tide and we founds lots of sand dollars and...but it's not very important.  As we were walking along the water, I saw a man in a large blue sweatshirt running on the beach.  I wasn't sure it was Martin, but my heart fell and I quickly bent down to look for something in the surf so that he wouldn't get a chance to see me as he ran by.  I didn't say anything to Caren, but I was dying inside.  Then, as we were walking up to our car, I saw the same man again returning from his run.  I'm pretty sure he didn't see me that time either.", "input": "", "output": "But you're not sure it was Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I was too busy hiding to get a clear view of his face.  But his mannerisms seemed very familiar.  But the weird part was that when we went to get burritos at Gordo's--about twenty blocks away from the beach--I saw that man again.  That time, he was crossing Geary Street--I recognized the blue sweatshirt.  It was as if he was following me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think he was?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know.  I don't know, Doctor!  Maybe?  I never got a good look, so I'm not sure it was Martin.", "input": "", "output": "You said that you still get a lot of messages from him..."}, {"instruction": "Nothing that would make me believe that he was back in town.  In fact, I thought that he was graduating sometime this week.  There's a ceremony.  He couldn't be here.  And yet...", "input": "", "output": "You only saw that man in a blue sweatshirt three times last Saturday, right?"}, {"instruction": "Not exactly.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?  Did you see him again?"}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't see him again.  But...oh, Doctor, this is really spooky.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "When I left home today, on the sidewalk in front of the entrance to my building was a drawing.", "input": "", "output": "On a piece of paper?"}, {"instruction": "No.  It was huge and was made with chalk directly on the sidewalk.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have a picture or can you describe the drawing?"}, {"instruction": "I don't have a picture. As I was leaving the house, the superintendent--a sweet old Italian guy--was washing it out with a hose and a brush, cursing about pornography. But it was like those Martin sketches he was sending me.  It was a headless female figure.  You could see pubic hair and I think only one nipple, but I'm not sure.  The body was nude but for a pair of boots which somehow turned into gloves.  One nipple was tied to the rail of the steps going up to the door.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like Martin's work, all right.  Based on that, I would say it's safe to assume that Martin was back in town, at least as of today."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You haven't been home since this morning?"}, {"instruction": "No, I came here straight from work.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have a chance to check your phone messages at home?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing.", "input": "", "output": "No messages?"}, {"instruction": "No messages.", "input": "", "output": "Are you worried about your personal safety?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.  Martin is all about getting abuse, not giving it.  But I have felt sick all day.  My stomach hurts and I've got a terrible headache.", "input": "", "output": "Feeling anxious?"}, {"instruction": "Very.  If this was Friday, I would consider going to my parents' for the weekend and skipping going home all together.

It was inevitable--if only at some computer convention or symposium or something.  But now I feel so unready to deal with him.  It's like I feel too weak to be around him right now.", "input": "", "output": "What are you worried about, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "It's just that I miss him.  Or miss being with him or something.  I thought he was a very interesting guy, if not for all that other stuff.  But he makes me feel very bad about myself.  See?  It's just too much emotional baggage that I guess I haven't dealt with yet.  The last thing I want to do is be around Martin.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that Martin could persuade you to go out with him again?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want to do that.", "input": "", "output": "But do you think that Martin could talk you into it?  Let's say he asked you just to have coffee with him and talk, would you do it?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  It's so tempting even when it's just you saying it.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Oh, don't be disappointed with me, Doctor.  I know I'm weak.  Maybe...maybe...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Do you think that you might consider...I would like to...it would be just for tonight, I promise!", "input": "", "output": "Consider what?"}, {"instruction": "I could stay with you?  And this way, you would save me from being so weak and getting myself into trouble?", "input": "", "output": "If you are so sure that you'll be in trouble by talking to Martin, then just say no."}, {"instruction": "But I don't know if I can do that, Doctor.  I don't think I'm strong enough.", "input": "", "output": "I think you are."}, {"instruction": "No, Doctor, no.  You've got to help me.  I would be as quiet as a mouse. I promise.  You wouldn't even know I'm there.  Please?  Please, Doctor Balis?  Just this one time?", "input": "", "output": "Anna, you know I can't do that..."}, {"instruction": "But what if I said that I am afraid of him?  Would you then?", "input": "", "output": "No.  In that case, I would suggest you stay someplace else, perhaps.  Are you afraid?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I promise I would be a very good girl.  I would do nothing to make you regret this.  Please?", "input": "", "output": "Anna, if you feel so strongly about not going home tonight, how about contacting Caren and asking her to let you stay with her?"}, {"instruction": "Caren is now living with Greg.  I couldn't do that.", "input": "", "output": "What about another friend?  How about Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "I'm not your only option, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I guess I could stay on the couch at SII's programming lounge.  I've done that before.  Or under my desk...", "input": "", "output": "That's pathetic, Anna.  I'm sure Kathy would be happy to help you out.

But..."}, {"instruction": "All right, all right.  I'll call Kathy.

How are you doing?  Better?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  I'm much better, thank you.  But I got a message from my answering service that you called in to cancel our session last week, just as they told you that I was too sick to see my patients.  What's up?  Where you sick?"}, {"instruction": "In a manner of speaking.   But I didn't think they would have told you anything.", "input": "", "output": "They tell me everything."}, {"instruction": "I should remember that.", "input": "", "output": "So what's up?"}, {"instruction": "I've been living the life of a fugitive.  I haven't been home in over a week.  And last Thursday I was in Davis with my parents.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Has Martin tried to contact you?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, it's so much worse than that, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What happened, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "They hired him!", "input": "", "output": "They who?"}, {"instruction": "SII, that's who.", "input": "", "output": "Martin is now working for SII?"}, {"instruction": "They recruited him right from school, even before he graduated.  Apparently he applied to SII sometime in April.  They went out there to meet him and hired him, just like that!  Apple offered him a job as well.  And I guess SII thought that if Apple wanted him at the time they were firing everyone else, he must be hot shit.  So now he's at SII doing god knows what.", "input": "", "output": "And he never told you anything?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing.  All those endless messages and he never told me the most important thing--he was going to live and work with me!", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Have you seen him yet?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I told you, I've been living the life of a fugitive.  It started the night I left your office two weeks ago and...oh, it simply has been awful.  I'm even thinking about quitting SII and going to work in some other country or something.", "input": "", "output": "That's a bit drastic, don't you think?  You shouldn't give Martin or anyone else that much power over your life choices and decisions.  Would you consider leaving your work and your home if Martin wasn't here?"}, {"instruction": "Of course not.  I love where I live and I even like working for SII--it's like a home to me now.  But...", "input": "", "output": "Not \"buts.\"  Martin is just a guy you dated for a few weeks.  So what if he works for SII?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but...you just don't understand, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I understand perfectly, Anna.  Martin probably took this job so that he can be around you.  Maybe he hopes to try to win your heart back.  There is a high chance that you will run into him a lot at work and around town.  But as unpleasant as those prospects are, it's only going to be bad for the first few months.  After a while, Martin will realize that it's over between you two and will eventually leave you alone."}, {"instruction": "A few months!  I don't know if I can take it for that long.", "input": "", "output": "Of course you can, Anna.  You're not giving yourself enough credit."}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  It's been such a horrible two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you tell me about them?"}, {"instruction": "I wasn't successful getting hold of Kathy, the evening I left your office.  So I finally called Caren.  She let me stay with her and Greg and, that night, I told them the whole story about Martin and everything that happened since.", "input": "", "output": "How did they take it?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, they were both extremely supportive.  But to be truthful, I didn't exactly give them all the details--I didn't think Caren was ready for that yet.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell them about your experience with Gray?"}, {"instruction": "I told them an edited version.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't think I could explain why I found the experience pleasureful at some level.", "input": "", "output": "So you presented the whole thing in a negative light?"}, {"instruction": "I told them that I didn't like feeling the pain.  And that's completely true.  I didn't like it.  But I did tell them that Gray and I had sex that night and that I felt very bad about that and that I blamed Martin for pushing me into a very bad situation.  And they agreed with me about that.  In fact, Greg was outraged that Martin supported my efforts in trying to understand his--Martin's--sexual perversions.  He said that if a man truly loved a woman, he would never have allowed her to go with another man and...well, let's just say Greg was very protective of me.  They both said that they understood now why I kept my distance from them and that they will now try to do everything they can to help me.", "input": "", "output": "That's nice."}, {"instruction": "Very nice.  Caren is a legal secretary, if you remember.  So as soon as she got to work on Friday, she looked up Martin--she wanted to know when his graduation was and just to check on him in general.  That's when she found out that Martin was hired by SII.  His graduation was actually a week before and he could have been in town when I first thought that I saw him that time on the beach.  But as soon as Caren knew that Martin was now working for SII, she called home--they let me sleep in and I was still in their apartment when she called--and told me about it.  Greg insisted that I stay with them that weekend.  I called in sick to work--in fact, I did feel very sick.  Greg was nice enough to volunteer to go to my apartment and pick up some changes of clothes for me.", "input": "", "output": "So that's how you avoided seeing Martin that first weekend.  Have you been to work since then?"}, {"instruction": "Greg went and talked with Jules for me.  I'm not sure exactly what Greg told him, he just said that they had a \"man to man\" talk about Martin.  Jules called after that and told me that he arranged for me to do some work at home.  He even insisted that I stay away until he has had a chance to check out Martin.", "input": "", "output": "Jules is very protective of you."}, {"instruction": "I'm the only woman in his department and...yes, he is.  I took my computer and spent the next week with my parents in Davis.  I came back the following Sunday.  Kathy volunteered to stay with me for a few days.  It's now been five.", "input": "", "output": "Did Martin try to contact you in all this time?"}, {"instruction": "He sent me a letter saying that he was in town and that he took the job at SII to be close to me.  He left a few phone messages--nothing too important, just saying hello.  And I think I saw him once across the street from my apartment, but I'm not sure about that.", "input": "", "output": "It doesn't sound too bad."}, {"instruction": "No.  But I haven't been alone yet either.", "input": "", "output": "When is Kathy moving out?"}, {"instruction": "She's going to a leather show over the weekend.  So she's got to leave tomorrow.  Do you believe it?  There are trade shows for whips and stuff--new trends in bondage wear, come and check out new technologies!", "input": "", "output": "That is funny.  It seems like the basic technology goes back thousands of years--whips and chains and the like.  I wouldn't expect a lot of recent innovations.  Are you going to go up to Davis again over the weekend?"}, {"instruction": "No.  My parents are freaked as it is.", "input": "", "output": "Why are they freaked?"}, {"instruction": "I guess they know something is going on that I'm not telling them.  Something bad enough that I come and stay with them for weeks at a time.  I'm surprised my mom is not coming to live with me.  She worries about me living alone all the time.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have plans with Caren and Greg or are you going to try being on your own for a few days?"}, {"instruction": "You're making me feel bad about myself, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "It's not my intention.  But I do think that you're running away from your problems.  I think you should talk to Martin and set some ground rules for interacting with him, since you are now sharing not only a city of residence but an employer as well.  You can't go on avoiding him forever.  And I also don't want Martin to feel like he is playing some sort of pursuit game with you.  By trying so hard to avoid him, you might actually encourage Martin to try harder to get you."}, {"instruction": "Oh, that sounds really bad.  That would be a sick game to play.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I don't think it would be good.  I believe you need to talk to Martin and tell him that you're not interested in having a relationship with him."}, {"instruction": "Relationship!  I'm not interested in being in the same place at the same time.", "input": "", "output": "Then tell him that and get on with your life."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "You can only go on hiding for so long."}, {"instruction": "I know.  I'll try, Doctor.  I'll really try.  It's getting late.  I need to get home; Kathy is cooking dinner for me tonight.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I'll see you next week, Anna.  But think about what I said."}, {"instruction": "I will.  Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna.  Have a nice dinner."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  Isn't it a wonderful day?  I love when it's warm enough to wear shorts to the office.  You know, one of the receptionists actually asked me if I was wearing anything under my t-shirt?  What was she thinking about?  I know my t-shirt is rather large, but just because you don't see someone's underwear do you assume that they don't have any on?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  You're in an interesting mood today."}, {"instruction": "Today was a very good day, for the first time in a long while.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I got the assignment I wanted at work--I won't bore you with the details.  Caren and Greg asked me to be in their wedding party--as a maid of honor, of course.  It's warm and the sun is shining.  What more could one ask for?", "input": "", "output": "I guess I would ask about Martin."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah, I had a very long and interesting conversation with Martin.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I took your advice, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "And what was that?"}, {"instruction": "You said that spending my life hiding out from god knows what is silly.  You told me to go and confront Martin.  And I did.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like it went well."}, {"instruction": "Very well.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So Martin is content with leaving you alone now?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's not exactly what happened.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Before you jump on me for saying that Martin and I are sort of back together, Doctor, let me explain what happened, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, Anna.  I'm here to listen..."}, {"instruction": "As you know, I spent all last week hiding out.  I was terrified of confronting Martin.  I thought that if I faced him, he would undermine my resolve to never socialize or associate with him ever again.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you were right."}, {"instruction": "I guess you could look at it that way.  But no matter.  Last Monday, I decided to take my life back under my control.  I moved back into my apartment and resolved not to let Martin rule my life any more.", "input": "", "output": "That was good."}, {"instruction": "Absolutely.  It was getting ridiculous.  I was living out of my purse--carrying my toothbrush and a spare pair of underwear with me wherever I went.  I was beginning to feel like a homeless person.  I was imposing on my friends.  I was asking my boss to do favors for me.  And all because of a guy.  And it's not like this guy wanted to kill me or to hurt me. Martin just wanted to talk to me.", "input": "", "output": "If all Martin wanted was to talk to you, he wouldn't have moved to the Bay Area and gotten a job in the same company you work for."}, {"instruction": "I wasn't answering his calls or his mail...", "input": "", "output": "I think a simple visit to San Francisco would have sufficed, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose so.  But I'm glad that he's here now.", "input": "", "output": "I gathered that."}, {"instruction": "So as I was saying, I moved back into my place on Monday.  I went to work like normal on Tuesday.  Martin approached me that afternoon.  It was amazing just how many people rushed to my rescue. But I told everyone that I could handle it, and Martin and I were left alone to talk.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I had this whole speech in my head prepared.  I was going to tell Martin that I just couldn't be with him even if we were to be friends and nothing more.  I was going to tell him that I thought he was a very smart guy, but there was just too much emotional baggage between us and...you get the idea.", "input": "", "output": "You had a whole \"Dear John\" speech in your head."}, {"instruction": "Precisely.  I thought it was good--I wasn't planning on attacking him or anything.  I just wanted to tell him to go away and never bother me again.", "input": "", "output": "So did you tell him all that?"}, {"instruction": "It didn't quite happened that way.  Martin insisted that if we were going to have a serious conversation, that I at least allow it to happen in private and not in SII's hallway where everyone was looking.  I can understand not wanting your co-workers see you get emotional and stuff, so I had to agree.", "input": "", "output": "Where and when did Martin want to talk with you?"}, {"instruction": "At first, I assumed that he would push to go to dinner with me.  But that's not at all what happened.  He really did want to talk to me privately.  And because he knew that I would worry about being alone with him, he suggested going to a park.  That way, we could have a private conversation and I would still feel safe with all the people around us.  So Wednesday after work we went to Golden Gate park.  Do you know the area around Stow Lake?", "input": "", "output": "No."}, {"instruction": "It's very nice.  There's a large walking trail all the way around this tiny island.  We went all the way to the top.  There is a spectacular view there.  We ended up staying till sunset--it was gorgeous!", "input": "", "output": "I'll have to check it out some time."}, {"instruction": "You should, you really should.  And there are so many other surprises in that park.  I've been going for years and still...", "input": "", "output": "So what did you talk about with Martin?"}, {"instruction": "We talked about my experience with Gray.  Martin said that he never knew that I didn't consent to having sex with him.  He said that it's an unwritten but highly respected rule in S&M community--the participants in a scene have to agree on all the details ahead of time.  There should never be any surprises.  He said that problems arise when a person has to give his or her consent during the event.  At that time, they might not be in full control of their own actions.  They might consent to something when they're in \"bottom space\" that they would never consent to when they weren't under the influence, so to speak.  And it does make sense.  It's like taking advantage of someone when they're drunk or something.  The whole thing for me was that I was completely out of control.  Gray was in charge of every little detail.  My life was in his hands.  When we did it at the end, I didn't have any choice.  I had to do it.", "input": "", "output": "As I remember it, you wanted to have sex with Gray."}, {"instruction": "Martin said that that happens a lot.  A lot of people who experience bottom space, especially for the first time, have a desire to consummate the relationship with their master through sex.  But Martin said that he was extremely upset that Gray took advantage of me like that.  He said that he always assumed that it was my intention from the start to have sex with Gray and that Gray and I talked about it when we first met.  That's why Martin reacted the way he did on the phone when I told him about my night with Gray--he thought that it was my expressed desire to do what I did.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Martin said that since I told him that I was doing research on S&M culture and rituals and had a friend to talk to about it, that I knew and understood what I was doing.  He was very sorry and extremely apologetic that he took such bad care of me.  He said that he felt like he let me down.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I think he was very sincere, Doctor.  When I didn't let him have an opportunity to talk with me--I mean after the Gray thing--Martin realized that the only way that he could reach me was by actually coming out here in person.  But he was worried that if he didn't keep in touch with me in some way before then, I would completely lose all interest in him and forget him.  So he kept calling and leaving me long messages telling me about his life, and how he feels, and how he misses me--keeping me involved in his life.  And it's true. If he just left me alone, I think I would have gotten over him and would have been able to move-on with my life.  But because he kept calling and trying, I could never feel that our relationship was over.  Somewhere in the back of my mind, I always pondered what-if questions.", "input": "", "output": "That was very smart of Martin."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Why did he lie about his graduation?  And why did he not tell you that he got a job with SII?"}, {"instruction": "He was afraid that I would completely freak if I found out.  And in fact, that's exactly what happened.  I didn't handle it well.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Martin said that he was going to try a romantic approach first.  That's why he made the drawing on the sidewalk in front of my building.  When he saw my reaction to it--apparently he was somewhere close by watching me--Martin realized that he would have to try some other way of reaching me.  He said that he didn't want to scare me or make me feel like he was stalking me.  All he wanted was a chance.", "input": "", "output": "And you gave it to him."}, {"instruction": "He really cares about me, Doctor.  It was touching just how much he cared.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Did you talk about anything else last night?"}, {"instruction": "I tried to explain to him what my feelings about S&M were.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he understood me, Doctor.  He said that it doesn't have to be all or nothing with him.", "input": "", "output": "What does that mean?"}, {"instruction": "He doesn't need to always do it that way.  He said that vanilla sex is fun too, once in a while.", "input": "", "output": "Vanilla sex?  How open-minded of him."}, {"instruction": "Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "Sorry.  What else did Martin tell you?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he would like to try again.  We could take it really slow this time.  We no longer have the time or distance constraints so we don't need to rush.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And we joked around a bit about the fact that we both like being bottoms.", "input": "", "output": "That's a problem.  Does Martin have any sensible solutions?"}, {"instruction": "He was saying that we could get a mistress for the both of us...Doctor!  It was only a joke.", "input": "", "output": "So what are you going to do, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "I think I'd like to try it.  As I said, we'll go real slow.  I have no intentions of jumping into this, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have plans for this weekend?"}, {"instruction": "We thought about going on a movie date.  Nothing too much, just meeting at a movie theater and then going to our respective homes afterwards.", "input": "", "output": "Not even a cup of coffee?"}, {"instruction": "I think not this time.  Don't worry so much, Doctor Balis.  I'm not being foolish.  I just want to know if Martin is one of those people that I'll end-up knowing all my life in one capacity or another.", "input": "", "output": "I think you're making a mistake, Anna.  I think it would be best if you put that relationship to rest."}, {"instruction": "I know how you feel, Doctor.  But really, I'm just...I won't do anything stupid.  I promise.  Okay, I've got to go.  I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Remember that you can always call me, if you need to."}, {"instruction": "I know, Doctor.  Good night.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "What you really mean, Doctor, is how's Martin?", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  How's Martin?"}, {"instruction": "He's been just wonderful.  Just so that you don't freak out on me, we didn't have sex and we're not planning on having sex in the near future.", "input": "", "output": "But you're talking about it?"}, {"instruction": "True.  We do talk about it.  But that's a good thing, no?  If we didn't talk about it, you would worry that I'm developing false expectations again.", "input": "", "output": "Are you?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't think so.  I realize that his tastes in sex deviate somewhat from the norm. But that's no longer scares me.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Have you talked about how you're going to reconcile your sexual differences when it comes time to having sex?"}, {"instruction": "We're working on that.  But it's just talk for now, nothing else.  I'm really having a good time when I'm in Martin's company.  We talk a lot--about everything, not just sex.  We watch movies together.  It seems that we have similar tastes in movies.  Martin doesn't even mind watching obvious girl movies.  You know, like \"My Friend's Wedding?\"  I think he really nurtures his feminine side, unlike other men who work very hard to repress it.  It's been good.  This last week, I mean.  Except for Caren and Greg...and Kathy...and a few other people who are just over the top with their protective shit.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Caren is all freaked that I'm hanging out with a \"certified pervert.\"  Greg is just dying to go and beat Martin's brains out.  And Kathy...well, she's been very strange lately.", "input": "", "output": "What's wrong with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "She's been so moody.  I was telling her about Martin, and she got all upset and even cried and then walked out on me.", "input": "", "output": "What did you say to her?"}, {"instruction": "I just told her that I decided to give Martin another chance.  I said that I had a long talk with him, during which we settled some of the misunderstandings between us.  But Kathy--she just didn't want to hear anything positive about Martin.  I thought she'd be happy for me.  She--and of course you, Doctor Balis--are the only people who know most of the details...of me and Martin and our relationship, I mean. She knows that I really cared about him.", "input": "", "output": "So you believe that Kathy's reaction to the news of you and Martin getting back together was irrational?"}, {"instruction": "Definitely.  I was hoping to introduce Kathy to Martin.  I thought that they have a lot in common and...but that's apparently totally out of the question.  And I don't know why.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy doesn't want to meet Martin?"}, {"instruction": "When I suggested that we have dinner together, she stormed out of the room crying.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And she also has been accusing me of not spending any time with her.  But she knows that I have a lot of catching up to do with Martin.  And it's not like I'm forgetting about her.  I want her to be with me.  But for the time being, it would have to be with Martin as well.  It shouldn't be a big deal.  I understand why Caren and Greg are freaked out.  They are totally straight and very conservative.  They'll never understand Martin.  But Kathy? She's even part of the community.  She doesn't have problems with people who are into S&M or who have other alternative sex preferences and desires.", "input": "", "output": "Before Martin came along, how much time were you spending with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  We talked on the phone a few times a day.  I guess we saw each other maybe five...six times a week?  Something like that.", "input": "", "output": "And now?"}, {"instruction": "I still talk to her every day.  But since she refuses to be in Martin's company, I haven't really seen her for any length of time in over a week or so.  I guess she's feeling abandoned.  But it's not like that, Doctor.  I still like her.  I just need to spend some time with Martin right now.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know if Kathy ever had a homosexual relationship?"}, {"instruction": "You mean like with a woman?  Well, homosexual relationship is a little strong.  I'm sure she has played with women sexually.  But that's not uncommon in the S&M community.  There are lots of times when two women play together.  But that doesn't mean that they're homosexuals.  Why?", "input": "", "output": "I've thought it possible for a while now that Kathy might have a crush on you.  What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "You mean that she's interested in me sexually? We're just good friends, Doctor.  Why would you think that?", "input": "", "output": "Well, there have been a series of incidents between you and her that seem to indicate that."}, {"instruction": "Like what?", "input": "", "output": "Well, masturbating while being in the same bed with you, comes to mind."}, {"instruction": "That was a bit strange.  But we'd been talking about sex and...you know how stuff like that can just happen.", "input": "", "output": "No, actually I don't.  I can't recall an incident where I was in bed with a guy and we were telling sexually explicit dreams to each other and masturbating.  It doesn't just happen."}, {"instruction": "It's different with men.  Women share more.", "input": "", "output": "So this has happened to you with someone else?  Did you and Caren ever do this?"}, {"instruction": "No.  But Kathy's different.", "input": "", "output": "I think so, too.  I think Kathy is interested in being a lot more than just a friend to you.  And I think she's jealous of all the attention you've been lavishing on Martin.  I think she's jealous of Martin."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "That would explain her recent behavior, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so.  I never thought of Kathy that way.  She's always been just a very close and dear friend.  You really think she likes me like that?", "input": "", "output": "I do."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.  Interesting.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps you should talk with her about this."}, {"instruction": "So Kathy likes me in that way?  You know, Doctor, I've never had a woman be interested in me sexually. I know I've told you about Caren and I, but that was...well, you know.", "input": "", "output": "I know."}, {"instruction": "Kathy's a very special person and I don't want to hurt her feelings.", "input": "", "output": "That's why you need to talk to her and explain how you feel--tell her that while you find her attentions flattering, you just can't reciprocate in the way she wants you to."}, {"instruction": "No, I can't.  I wonder what Martin will say when I tell him about this?", "input": "", "output": "I believe it would be best if you had this conversation with Kathy in private."}, {"instruction": "Oh, of course.  I wouldn't dream of embarrassing her like that.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "That does explain a lot.  I wonder why that didn't occur to me before?", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes it helps to have an outside perspective to notice certain things."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  Oh, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I need to cancel our appointment for next week.", "input": "", "output": "No problem.  That's the day before the Fourth of July.  Starting your holiday weekend early?"}, {"instruction": "You can say that.  I'm going to my parents' for the weekend.", "input": "", "output": "That's nice."}, {"instruction": "And Martin is invited.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "It's the first time I'm going to bring home a man that I'm dating.  My parents are kind of excited.", "input": "", "output": "So they know about Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I just told them a little.  But I think my dad and Martin will really get along well.  My dad likes that Martin has a doctorate degree and is very intelligent.  And my mom will get a kick out of Martin volunteering to do the dishes--I told him he must.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Aren't you worried that your parents might get a wrong idea about Martin?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "Well, if you've never brought home a man you've been dating before, doing it now may make Martin more significant in your parents' minds than you intend.  Don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "Oh that.  I told my mom not to get any ideas--I'm not planning on getting married in the near future.  Although, Martin will be my date to Caren's and Greg's wedding.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  I thought Greg wanted to pound him into the ground."}, {"instruction": "Oh Doctor, relax.  Have a wonderful Fourth of July weekend.  And I'll see you the following week with all the dirty details.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I'll see you then, Anna.  Have a good visit with you parents.  And good luck with Kathy."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  How are things going?  How was your visit with your parents?"}, {"instruction": "Do you want a short version or a long one?", "input": "", "output": "Judging from your tone of voice, I want the long one.  What happened?  Your parents didn't like Martin?"}, {"instruction": "It's not as simple as that, Doctor.  My parents were very excited to meet Martin.  He was the first man I wanted to bring home and introduce to my parents.  My mom was probably shopping for baby clothes after I asked her for permission to bring Martin for the Fourth of July family barbecue.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like your parents were predisposed to liking Martin.  So what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we drove to Davis last Thursday right after work.  You just wouldn't believe the traffic up I-80.  It was as if the whole Bay Area was evacuating or migrating or something.  We didn't get to my parents' house until well after eleven o'clock at night.  My mom was nice enough to warm up some leftovers for us--we were starved.  But despite the fact that it was so late, I thought their first impression of Martin was good.  And after Martin settled in the guest room, I went upstairs and probed my parents for their opinions about Martin.", "input": "", "output": "That's a bit soon--they only met him."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But it was very important to me to know how they felt about him, even though those feelings were based on only a few minutes of interaction.", "input": "", "output": "So what did they think?"}, {"instruction": "My mom thought he was very nice--Martin offered to clean up and help do the dishes after we ate. She even said that Martin was cute.  And my dad said that Martin looked like a decent fellow, but he reserved the right to change his mind after the barbecue.  But basically, they liked him.  I sneaked down to Martin's room and told him that they did and that he was doing a good job.  And then I went to my room--I didn't want my parents to feel like I'm sneaking behind their back or doing something bad in their house.  But it was very strange to sleep in my room--the room I slept in when I was a little girl--and have my parents a few feet away, and all with Martin in the same house.  Do you understand?", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  In your parents' house, you could feel and be treated as a child.  But Martin represents a very adult part of your life.  The combination..."}, {"instruction": "Right, the combination is very strange.  Well, I was finally able to fall asleep and I ended up sleeping until ten.  No one woke me up or anything.  They just let me sleep, and poor Martin had to be alone with my parents all morning.  I mean, it wasn't bad.  But I bet he was feeling pretty uncomfortable and strange, too.", "input": "", "output": "And did Martin continue to make a good impression on your parents?"}, {"instruction": "Absolutely.  When I finally got down to the kitchen, they were all having coffee and talking about Pathfinder and the Martian landing and stuff.  I could tell that my dad was impressed with Martin.  Martin knew a lot about the mission and the kind of programming that they did for Pathfinder's on board computers--my dad was ready to adopt him, I think.", "input": "", "output": "So I don't understand--the visit went very well, right?"}, {"instruction": "It could have and it should have.  I'm so outraged, Doctor Balis, I can't even tell you.", "input": "", "output": "Outraged at what?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my dad and Martin were setting up the barbecue in the yard and marinating the meat--all that male bonding stuff.  And my mom and I were getting together the rest of the meal.  My parents were expecting another couple to join us.  Then the phone rings.  My mom gets it and after the initial hello, she tells me that she got to take it in the other room.  That was fine with me. I just went to hung out with Martin and my dad--they were more fun anyway.  Then my mom calls for my dad to come into the house.  And that was nice too--it was the first chance Martin and I had to be alone all morning.  But when my dad came down, he started to act very strangely.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "It was like someone just pull the plug or something.  Just five minutes ago, he was all buddy buddy with Martin and now he could hardly look the guy in the face.  I tried asking him what was wrong, but he only waved me off with a strange expression on his face.  I didn't know what got into him, so I stayed around and tried making Martin as comfortable as possible--he was a guest after all.", "input": "", "output": "And you didn't know what was wrong with your dad?"}, {"instruction": "I had no idea at the time.  It looked like he lost his mind.  Martin tried helping him move the grill over, but my dad jumped when he touched him.  So Martin just backed off.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And then my mom came down.  And she was even more strange than my dad.  She kept giving Martin these very bizarre looks--like he was a leper or had some some form of particularly disfiguring facial skin cancer.  I just couldn't figure out what got into the two of them.  One moment, they couldn't get enough of Martin and the next, they couldn't find a safe enough distance away from him.  I was just about ready to confront them on this, when their friends arrived.  We spent the rest of the afternoon pretending there was nothing wrong.  Martin offered to make a portrait for my mom's friend.  It came out very well.  But when Martin wanted to do one of mom, she freaked.  Even her friends thought she was acting strangely.", "input": "", "output": "Did you try asking your mom or dad what was wrong?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't get a chance until later.  Or, more accurately, I was forced into a very bizarre discussion with my mom pretty much against my will.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "That evening, we had planned to go to Sacramento--the Old Town part.  There were fireworks scheduled, and it's a nice place for a stroll on a warm summer evening--very romantic.  Have you ever been?", "input": "", "output": "No."}, {"instruction": "So we're getting ready to go, and my mom suddenly decides that she wants to take two separate cars.  They have a mini-van, Doctor.  And parking in the old town during the holiday...it's just not how my mom thinks.  And she wants to drive with me in my car while everybody else goes in the van.", "input": "", "output": "Including Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I told her that I didn't want to have Martin in a different car--he didn't know anybody and he would feel uncomfortable.  But my mom got all...I don't know.  There was no arguing with her, and Martin told me that it was okay and that he'd be all right.  So I drove with my mother.  And then she told me.", "input": "", "output": "Told you what?"}, {"instruction": "Why they were acting like they had been taken over by body snatchers or something.  Kathy called.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "I knew that she was upset when I told her that Martin was going with me to meet my family.  She thought that I was forcing things and rushing into a relationship that could really cause me a lot of pain.  She went on and on.  She was just relentless.  But I understood her motivations--she was jealous.  I have to tell you, Doctor Balis, I wasn't convinced when you suggested that Kathy might have a crush on me.  I'm so clueless about that kind of thing--I need a ton of bricks dropped on my head.  But after that conversation...well, it was obvious even to me.", "input": "", "output": "Why did Kathy call your parents?"}, {"instruction": "She thought that they should know a few things about Martin.  My mom wouldn't tell me what Kathy said to her.  But she said that she's extremely worried about me and showed me a fax of Martin's first drawing--the one with the whip.  Kathy sent it to her.  That explained why my mom was so freaked when Martin wanted to draw her. I was so angry at Kathy, I can't tell you. But I finally managed to calm my mom down.  I told her that Kathy had a very bad experience recently, and that she's very unstable and paranoid when it comes to men.  It must have been consistent with my mom's conversation with Kathy, for she grabbed on to that explanation.", "input": "", "output": "And the drawing?"}, {"instruction": "I said that the drawing was a joke and an illustration of a science fiction short story that Martin and I read together.  I'm good, Doctor. My mom liked that explanation, too.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you are good.  Reminds me of our first sessions together."}, {"instruction": "I'll take that as a compliment, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Did you get a chance to talk with Kathy since then?"}, {"instruction": "She's been avoiding me.  I think she's afraid of facing me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Does your dad feel better about Martin?"}, {"instruction": "My mom had a talk with him.  He stopped acting like a complete lunatic with Martin after that.  But the warm feelings that he was showing for Martin before are gone.  I think he'll come around and will like Martin after he sees him a few more times.", "input": "", "output": "And Martin?"}, {"instruction": "He's been very supportive and understanding through the whole thing.  He even encouraged me to patch things up with Kathy--he told me that he can certainly understand how she must feel now since he used to feel that way about her.  Martin told me that he used to be jealous of Kathy. Strange isn't it, Doctor?  The world just keeps flipping from one extreme to the other.", "input": "", "output": "It certainly seems that way in your case."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure that I'm not the most screwed up patient you have, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Our time is up.  I'll see you next week?"}, {"instruction": "You're not going to confirm that?", "input": "", "output": "I can't talk about my patients, Anna.  Even to you."}, {"instruction": "Okay, then.  I will see you next week.  I mean, who else would believe my life story?  Have a good weekend, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  I got a phone call from your service saying that you were going out of town and wouldn't be able to meet with me last week.  I missed you.", "input": "", "output": "How's..."}, {"instruction": "So where were you, Doctor Balis? Was it business or pleasure?", "input": "", "output": "It was personal."}, {"instruction": "Can't talk about it, huh?", "input": "", "output": "No, I..."}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay.  I'll try not to get jealous.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "That's okay, I understand.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, it was my father.  He was sick, but he's better now."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm sorry.  Do you want to talk about it?", "input": "", "output": "No, thank you."}, {"instruction": "As you wish.  So let's talk about my week.", "input": "", "output": "Is there something in particular or..."}, {"instruction": "Let me see, there are my parents--they've been calling me every day to check up on Martin and me.  Then there's Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "How is Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "You should ask Martin. He's been hanging out with her every day for the past week.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't know that they'd met.  Wasn't Kathy unwilling to even be introduced to Martin?"}, {"instruction": "She was when I was asking her.  But Martin has charms that I apparently lack.", "input": "", "output": "So why is Martin socializing with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "He gave me a long lecture about how difficult it is to make and keep good friends.  He told me that he thought Kathy was a good friend to me despite trying to damage our relationship over the Fourth of July weekend.  So Martin went over to her bookstore and talked his way into becoming friends with Kathy.  Can you believe it?  The guy is smooth.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't really know yet.  I'm really mad at Kathy.  I don't know how long it will take me now to convince my parents that everything is normal.  And who knows?  For the rest of our lives, they might harbor suspicions that Martin is a pervert.  I didn't need this.  I have my own worries about our relationship, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "But Martin is trying to patch things up between you and Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "If he is, he hasn't done it yet.  So far it's been all about him and Kathy spending time together talking.", "input": "", "output": "What do they talk about?"}, {"instruction": "Martin says that this is yet another way for him to get to know me.  I guess so.  But I wish he'd just concentrate on talking to me.", "input": "", "output": "So you do feel jealous of the time Martin and Kathy spend together."}, {"instruction": "Not really jealous.  I don't know.  I feel excluded somehow.  And I'm not sure I like them talking about me all this time.  I do like them both, and what they think of me is very important to me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And if they become friends, how could I talk to them about my problems and feelings relating to them?  Before, I could call Kathy and talk to her about Martin.  And I could discuss Kathy's outrageous meddling with Martin.  But if they become friends...I'm just not sure I'm ready to share in this way.", "input": "", "output": "But you wanted Kathy to become friends with Martin, remember?  You didn't want her to be upset or feel neglected when you were with Martin."}, {"instruction": "That's not exactly what I wanted, Doctor.  I wanted Kathy to be friends with Martin only through me, not independent of me.  You see the difference?", "input": "", "output": "I do."}, {"instruction": "At least for a while, until I get more comfortable with Martin.  Things are so uncertain with us.  We're still not sure we can make this work.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't we talk about that.  What works in your relationship with Martin and what doesn't?"}, {"instruction": "Well, first of all, there are a lot of things that work.  We like the same things.  It's really uncanny just how much our tastes in music, movies, books, and food match.  We went to see \"Hercules,\" and we both loved it.  I know that Caren wants to go see it, but Greg said that there's no way he's going to a Disney thing until he has to, meaning when he has kids.  So things are really perfect with Martin.  At least as far as all of that is concerned.  And my parents liked him--I'm sure they'll get over the whatever it is that Kathy told them about Martin.  And Martin is very smart.  I really like that.  We can talk about things and he's always able to tell me some new fact or something on almost any subject.  And he's very nice about it--he doesn't rub it in.  Some men would just...like Bill, for example.  He would always try to impress me with how much he knew.  But Martin is not like that.", "input": "", "output": "That's good."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's really good.  But...", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Every once in while Martin will do something that's completely alien to me.  And I can see that it's the most natural and normal thing in the world to him.  But for me...it's like a rough spot on the surface of a toilet seat--sure you could ignore it, but you think about it every time you're just about ready to sit on it.  You know?", "input": "", "output": "I think so."}, {"instruction": "And when these things happen, I just feel like my happiness stumbles and I worry that I won't be able to take it all in the long run.", "input": "", "output": "Can you describe some of these stumbling blocks in your relationship?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Kathy's one.  What is he doing with her?  I'll make up with her when I'm good and ready.  I don't need for Martin to run a diplomatic mission.", "input": "", "output": "Are there other things?"}, {"instruction": "I got up one night, and Martin wasn't in bed with me.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sleeping together?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but that's all we're doing.  No sex, Doctor, of any kind.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So I get up, and he's not there.  I figured that he went to the bathroom or something, and since I was up, I figured that I would go too.  But he's not there.  I look around--I have a studio apartment--and I see light from under the door of my walk-in closet.  I opened it.  There was Martin lying on the closet floor naked with my shoes piled all over him, masturbating.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I closed the door and went to bed.  What should have I done, Doctor?  Join him?  Shoes are just not my thing.  Or the other day, we were sitting in a coffee house having breakfast.  I had a jelly donut and some of the jelly leaked out and dripped onto my shoe.  Without skipping a beat, Martin just bent down and with one motion licked it off.  I was frozen with embarrassment.  But the way he did it, I don't even think anyone noticed.  But it was a sneaker, for god's sake!", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell Martin that you didn't like that?"}, {"instruction": "I couldn't.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Because he was holding my hand telling me how much pleasure I allow him and what a good mistress I am to him.", "input": "", "output": "Are there any other mistress/slave behaviors?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  Every time I take a shower, Martin turns into a shower slave boy.  He rubs my back, washes my hair, towels me dry--or licks me dry depending on the area and my mood--helps me get dressed, picks out my clothes.  And don't get me wrong, there are times when I'm into this too.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "Just not every day.  There's just so much licking my toes can stand, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk to Martin about that?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean sort of?"}, {"instruction": "I just don't want to ruin it, Doctor.  I like Martin.  He's a bit strange, but I like him.  And I really really want this to work.  I'm tired of going from one failed relationship to another.  I want to make a stand and try as hard as I can to succeed.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think..."}, {"instruction": "I know that you're against Martin, Doctor.  But for all his faults, Martin's the nicest and most loving man I've ever been with.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes that's just not enough, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But I want to try, Doctor.  And when I come across something that I just can't live with...well, we'll see what will happen then, won't we?", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "Please, Doctor, don't.  I want to feel free to tell you everything.  So please don't be too negative about Martin and me.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "But Anna..."}, {"instruction": "Please, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Our time is up for today.  Next Thursday?"}, {"instruction": "I'll come in next week at our usual time.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I'll see you then.  Have a good week, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doctor Balis.  I got a bad cold, I think.  Or maybe it's a flu.  Don't worry--I won't breathe on you too much, though.", "input": "", "output": "Shouldn't you be in bed?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I'll go home soon.  I was just at work and as long as I was that close to your office...well, it seemed like a good idea at the time.  But I'm feverish and my decision making is certainly impaired.", "input": "", "output": "How high is your fever?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know.  A hundred and two?  A hundred and three?", "input": "", "output": "That sounds awfully high."}, {"instruction": "Well, maybe it's lower then.  Stop asking me all these questions, Doctor.  Can't you see I'm sick?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Why don't we not have our session today?  I think you should go home now."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.  I guess if you really don't want to be around me...I can take a hint.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, you're obviously really sick."}, {"instruction": "Tell me something I don't know.  But I still want to talk a bit, if you don't mind.", "input": "", "output": "Well, if you insist."}, {"instruction": "This situation with Martin and Kathy is getting all out of hand.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "They are spending way too much time together.  It's not like I'm jealous or anything, Doctor, but I wish...I just want them to stop.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk to Martin about it?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  He told me that I was overreacting.", "input": "", "output": "I think you might be.  How often does Martin see Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "He saw her Monday for lunch, and yesterday for coffee after work.  And who knows?  They might be talking on the phone the rest of the time.", "input": "", "output": "Why does it bother you so much?"}, {"instruction": "They are both supposed to be in love with me, right?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I just feel like I'm losing them both, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Did you make up with Kathy yet?"}, {"instruction": "We talked on the phone.  She apologized, sort of, and I said that I forgave her.  But we haven't gotten together after that, and it still feels very weird.", "input": "", "output": "When did you have this conversation with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "Monday night.", "input": "", "output": "It's only been a few days..."}, {"instruction": "But she's not making an effort to see me.", "input": "", "output": "Are you making an effort to her?"}, {"instruction": "I just wanted her to make the first move.  I don't know, I guess you're right, Doctor.  I'm probably overreacting.  But I felt so sick all day today and since I couldn't really concentrate on my work, I just churned and mulled over this whole thing with Kathy and Martin and all.  At least Martin and I are doing better.", "input": "", "output": "You are?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  We are sort of having sex now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess we are having sex now.  It's just that we don't actually had intercourse yet.", "input": "", "output": "But you engaged in other sexual activities?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  We developed this really cool way of dealing with our sexual needs.  I think we can both be satisfied if we try to make it work and follow the rules.", "input": "", "output": "What are the rules?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, you'll like them, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "I hope so."}, {"instruction": "Well, since Martin is into doing one type of sexual play and I like doing something else, we figured that the only way we could make this work is if we can figure out a fair way to divide our sexually active time together into activities that Martin likes and those that I like.  And, of course, there are some things we both like, so they fall into a separate category.", "input": "", "output": "I'm still not sure what your system is."}, {"instruction": "Martin and I wrote down all the different kinds of sexual things we like to do and then we rated them according to the amount of time they take on the average including the set-up time, the amount of energy they require of each participant, and just how much pleasure each of us gets from that particular activity.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Very scientific."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry, Doctor.  Let me give an example.  Martin likes for me to put on the \"come fuck me\" shoes and he masturbates while licking the shoes and my legs.  So licking and masturbating with shoes gets a rating of 10 on Martin's pleasure scale and a rating of 1 on my pleasure scale.  So I can 9 pleasure points added to my point bank.  Since Martin asked for this act, I get the time and difficulty points as well.  This activity doesn't take much set-up time and usually takes about fifteen minutes--it earns me 4 time points.  And it really doesn't require much of me except for wearing the shoes and bearing the tickling, so I get just 3 difficulty points.", "input": "", "output": "I still..."}, {"instruction": "If I agree to do this shoe-fucking, then it costs Martin those points. See?", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "Each sexual act that we could think of, we rated this way.  Now we have this very extensive chart, and if I'm into doing oral sex one night--remember that I like to give it almost more than receive it--then Martin could look up the points for that on our sex-rating chart and I would be obligated to let him earn the appropriate number of points. It's like a sex barter system.  I think it works very well, especially if one works out the points to be accurate and agreed upon ahead of time.  I think it's very ingenious, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "It's interesting.  Who came up with this idea?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, it was both of us.  We started talking about it one night.  And after we identified our problem, we were able to come up with this solution.  It's been real good for us.", "input": "", "output": "And how long have you been doing this?"}, {"instruction": "Four days now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I think it's a great system.  Maybe you can use it with your other patients, hmm, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I think your sexual relationship with Martin is somewhat unique, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I think I've got to go now.  I'm really beginning to feel like the world is just spinning and fading out of my control.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like me to call you a cab?"}, {"instruction": "I think so.  Do you mind?", "input": "", "output": "Not at all.  Lie down here and I'll call the taxi."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "No problem, Anna.  Drink plenty of fluids and get some rest.  I hope you don't have any plans for this weekend, because I don't think you should get out of bed."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis.  I have Martin and Kathy to thank for that.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, they both took such good care of me, Doctor Balis.  I was so sick, and they were my nurses and helpmates and cooks and entertainment all rolled into one glorious...make that two beautiful packages.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that you have such good friends, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, me too.  As you can tell, I completely made up with Kathy.  She even stayed with us for a few days over the weekend to help Martin take care of me.", "input": "", "output": "All three of you stayed at your apartment?"}, {"instruction": "Oh no.  My place is way too small.  But Martin is getting paid big bucks, so his place is really nice; he rented a two bedroom apartment which even has a view of the bay from the kitchen window.", "input": "", "output": "Somehow I got the impression that Martin lived with you."}, {"instruction": "No way. I'm not ready for that kind of commitment, Doctor.  I want to be able to throw the guy out any time I please.  I'm not saying I will, but I want to be able to without feeling guilty that he's going to have to live on the street or something, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  So you stayed at Martin's."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  After I left your office last week, I got home feeling just dreadful.  When Martin called that evening, I could hardly talk to him.  So he came over and told me that he was taking me away to his place where he could take better care of me.  When we arrived, Kathy was there already, wearing an apron, ready to serve me chicken soup.  I was so happy to see her, I cried.  We both cried--I hate fighting, I just hate it.  I couldn't eat the soup--I was too sick.  But boy, it was so nice of them.  Martin set me up in his bed--he has this giant waterbed.  I always thought that those things would be really uncomfortable.  But the water inside is heated, so when I got in, it was very nice and cozy.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "San Francisco's winter-cold summer nights are hard when you have a cold.  The toasty waterbed was just right.", "input": "", "output": "And where were Martin and Kathy sleeping?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor!  I'm shocked you would be interested in such details.", "input": "", "output": "Sure you are."}, {"instruction": "They slept on the sofa-bed in Martin's office--the second bedroom.", "input": "", "output": "Both of them?"}, {"instruction": "Well, neither of them wanted to sleep with me--they could have easily caught my cold.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, you have a dirty mind.  Just because two people sleep in the same bed doesn't mean that they have to do anything other than sleep, does it?", "input": "", "output": "So you were comfortable with those arrangements?"}, {"instruction": "I thought it was kind of fun.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, they both have a crush on me and...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, it sort of made me feel powerful in a strange kind of way.", "input": "", "output": "Can you talk more about that?"}, {"instruction": "Well--I know this is going to sound very bad--I was basically naked except for a t-shirt that Martin gave me the entire weekend.  And I know that both Kathy and Martin were turned on by me--I saw the way they looked at my butt when my t-shirt would pull up a little.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You've seen my butt, Doctor, you know it looks pretty good.  And there was also this thing with both Martin and Kathy enjoying the submissive part in the relationship.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, they both were falling head over heels trying to please me all weekend.  They cooked for me, and they cleaned for me, and they read me books.  Martin went and got four movies for us to watch together.  I felt very pampered.  And the nice thing was that I knew that both of them were into serving me--they were getting a kick out of it.  So, at night, I imagined that they would both get into bed a bit turned on, but not for each other--for me.  I know that this makes me not a very nice person, but it turned me on to know that they both wanted me.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I'm concerned that you're setting up a situation in which..."}, {"instruction": "I know--I'm the center of attention again.  I'm sorry, Doctor, but I really like it.  I'm enjoying this a lot.", "input": "", "output": "Well, how far do you want to take this, Anna?  Are you prepared to enter into a three-way sexual relationship with Martin and Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "No.  But...", "input": "", "output": "From what you're telling me, it sounds like you're setting up the ground work which could quite naturally resolve itself into Kathy becoming sexually involved with both you and Martin.  If that's not what you want, you'd better be very clear about it, because now Kathy and Martin have very good reasons to believe that you're interested in that kind of arrangement."}, {"instruction": "That's silly--I'm not even gay.  Why would I want to have a sexual relationship with Kathy?", "input": "", "output": "Your relationship with Kathy is already slanted that way--how many people, with whom you didn't have a sexual relationship, have you watched masturbate while lying in the same bed?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, that again.  It wasn't a big deal.  And it certainly doesn't imply that we are interested in each other that way.", "input": "", "output": "You acknowledged yourself that Kathy is interested and sexually attracted to you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  But I'm not.  And Martin is interested in me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  But do you think that Martin might be interested in having a three-way relationship?  It's not that uncommon in the S&M community where some members tend not to practice exclusively monogamous sex."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.  I don't think that Martin would be interested.  He tried so hard and for so long to get me that I would be surprised if he would just go ahead and risk it all by getting involved with Kathy.  And I think that Kathy cares for me much too much to do something like that, too.", "input": "", "output": "But both Martin and Kathy have openly expressed interest in you, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Kathy never came out and actually said...", "input": "", "output": "Come on, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.  Well, I didn't mean to make it seem like I was interested in that sort of thing.  I just want us to be good friends.", "input": "", "output": "Then you need to make your intentions perfectly clear--no more sleeping in the same bed with both of them.  And try to keep your underwear on, unless you mean to seduce someone."}, {"instruction": "But I'm comfortable with my body, and so are Kathy and Martin.  Should I now get all prudish and insist on wearing clothes in the hot tub, for example?", "input": "", "output": "There is being comfortable with one's body, and then there is flirting and setting up sexually explicit situations.  Does Kathy get naked in front of Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Well?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy always sleeps naked.  And she only wore an apron while preparing breakfast.  But the rest of the time, she was fully clothed.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy probably saw him naked when he was getting ready to take a shower and then while he was getting dressed.", "input": "", "output": "And you don't think that this situation is likely to lead to the three of you sleeping together?"}, {"instruction": "As I said, I don't think that Kathy and Martin would do it.  And for the three-way combination that you're talking about, they'd need my permission, right?", "input": "", "output": "And if the circumstances were such that you found yourself in bed with the two of them naked and making out, would you be able to say no and pull the plug?"}, {"instruction": "I'll make sure that it doesn't go that far.", "input": "", "output": "Has it ever been close?"}, {"instruction": "The closest it's been is when we watched \"Henry and June\" in bed together.", "input": "", "output": "Without underwear?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "That's pretty close."}, {"instruction": "But that was last weekend when I was very sick.  Otherwise we would have watched it in the living room, and I would have been fully clothed--like everyone else.  In fact, Martin moved his television into the bedroom just to accommodate me while I was sick.  That couldn't happen again--the TV is back in his living room.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, that really helps."}, {"instruction": "It does.", "input": "", "output": "Look, Anna, we're out of time for today.  I want you to think about what it is that you really want to do.  And try not to lie to yourself--it doesn't work for very long."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you next week, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I'm fine, Doctor Balis.  And you'll be happy to know that I've kept my underwear on this entire week.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't realize that it was going to be that hard to do."}, {"instruction": "It is when you're going to an S&M function.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy, Martin, and I went to one of those things last Saturday.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, both Martin and Kathy are into that, Doctor Balis.  And I don't particularly mind going, as long as I'm mostly a spectator rather than a participant.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So how many points does Martin owe you now?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "How many?"}, {"instruction": "All together or just from that evening?", "input": "", "output": "How about all together?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, about twenty-five or so.", "input": "", "output": "Isn't that a lot of points?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I was very nice to Martin last week.  But he'll pay me back, no problem.", "input": "", "output": "And does Kathy owe you anything?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't had sex with Kathy, Doctor.  So why...", "input": "", "output": "I'm just checking--you did go to a sex social together."}, {"instruction": "True.  But what I did to her there was not really sex.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "There was a seminar on how to use a paddle correctly--where to do it, how to avoid injury, how to increase pleasure, how to avoid wrist-injury...", "input": "", "output": "Repetitive strain kind of thing?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  If you don't know how to hold the paddle correctly...", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "So we were there learning, and the teacher...", "input": "", "output": "The paddle master?"}, {"instruction": "Are you making fun of me?", "input": "", "output": "Not at all, please go on."}, {"instruction": "So the teacher wanted some volunteers.  Kathy wanted to do it.", "input": "", "output": "To be paddled?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  She is into that.  But then they wanted someone to come up and try using the paddle.  And Martin volunteered me!", "input": "", "output": "Oh really?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the up-shot is that I ended up spanking Kathy's little bottom.  I didn't do it very hard.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure."}, {"instruction": "And I felt very self conscious doing it--everyone was watching me, and I was afraid of hurting Kathy by doing it wrong or something.  Martin seemed to get a kick out of it all.  He even volunteered to be my next bottom, but we were out of time and they told us that we could do it at our leisure later on in the evening.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't.  I told you, I was just there as a spectator.  Kathy and Martin wanted to get their la-la's out of their systems, so they went for it.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy and Martin got paddled?  By each other or were there others ready to service them?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, Kathy did do Martin for a bit.  It was very funny to watch, somehow.  Kathy is so little and Martin towered over her even in the crouching position that he was in.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But Kathy got her satisfaction elsewhere.  She has a regular beating-buddy, I guess.  I didn't want to watch that.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, they do nipple clamping and they use whips and stuff.  I saw others doing it and it almost made me sick.  If I watched Kathy, I think I would have passed right out.", "input": "", "output": "Just from watching?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not squeamish or anything.  It's just that I know her, and that makes it worse somehow.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  But it was all right to watch Martin's beating?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah--now, how many girlfriends get to enjoy that?  Just kidding!  Martin only did that with Kathy, and she was very gentle with him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  So Martin didn't try to engage in that sort of activity with other members of this S&M club?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I told you that Martin is still very insecure about our relationship and he won't go and try to fool around with other people on me.  And even if...when he's more comfortable with me, even then I don't think he'd do it.  He's a one-woman kind of masochist, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "A monogamous masochist."}, {"instruction": "Exactly.  Martin is monogamous.", "input": "", "output": "So why was he getting whipped by Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "Paddled.", "input": "", "output": "Paddled."}, {"instruction": "Because I don't particularly like to do it.  I did a little last week, but I just really don't enjoy it.  It's strange--getting whipped is a lot more exhilarating for me than whipping someone else.", "input": "", "output": "Paddled."}, {"instruction": "Paddled, right.  I really never realized just how sharp the boundaries between a bottom and a top are.", "input": "", "output": "So you really consider yourself a bottom?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I like ordering Martin around.  It's sort of fun.  But I'm not into hurting him--inflicting pain is just not right for me.  I get mega points for doing that, though!", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So I sort of feel like I'm most comfortable thinking of myself as being both--a bottom sometimes and a top occasionally.  Mostly, I guess, I'm just into  the vanilla sex kind of thing.  Boring, huh?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think so.  But since you're with Martin, it's..."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know.  I'm trying very hard to work this out.", "input": "", "output": "So you never actually answered why it was okay for Kathy to beat on Martin."}, {"instruction": "Oh.  I guess because she's a friend.  I trust her.", "input": "", "output": "You do realize that both Kathy and Martin get sexual satisfaction from this, right?"}, {"instruction": "It's not like they are having intercourse.", "input": "", "output": "No.  But none the less..."}, {"instruction": "It feels okay somehow that they do it.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know where the dividing line is?  At what point is it not okay?"}, {"instruction": "I think it's when they actually touch each other.", "input": "", "output": "You mean flesh to flesh?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  If Kathy actually started to spank him with her bare hands and touch him places...I think that would be too much.  It feels like it would be too much.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I've been thinking about what you said--I mean about a three-way relationship with Kathy, Martin, and me.  The more I think about it, the more I don't know what to think.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "On one hand, it's not as unappealing as all that.  I like Kathy and Martin a lot.  I think it would be fun, and we all could get sexual fulfillment and satisfaction out of such a relationship.  But then I think about long term.  How is it suppose to work if we--Martin and I--wanted a more serious commitment?  What if we wanted to get married and have a family?  What would happen to Kathy?", "input": "", "output": "Those are interesting questions."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  Maybe if there was some sort of prenuptual agreement between us--something that stated our intentions from the start so that no one would feel like their expectations weren't met.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think it's that simple, Anna.  You're not dealing with money--that's what prenuptual agreements are usually about.  This is all about your feelings.  How are you going to feel in the future about Martin and Kathy?  And how is Kathy going to feel about you and Martin?  Do you believe that if Kathy was truly in love with either of you, she would willingly give it up just because she signed some agreement in the past?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Would you?"}, {"instruction": "No, I guess not.  It's all so complicated, Doctor.  I just want us all to be happy.", "input": "", "output": "That's why I really want you to think this thing through."}, {"instruction": "I'm thinking. I'm thinking, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Then I'll see you next week, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.  I'll see you then.  Oh, and I'll keep trying to keep my underwear on!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Good, good.  How was yours?", "input": "", "output": "As usual."}, {"instruction": "Never giving anything away, eh?", "input": "", "output": "So what's up?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, working a lot.  I went on that damn roller-blading extravaganza that SII instigates every Friday afternoon.  You should go some time just to get a taste of what it's like.", "input": "", "output": "Roller-blading is just not my thing."}, {"instruction": "It's not mine either, but it's a good way to show off your butt.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "I'm just trying to get your goat, Doctor Balis.  But I was wearing those bike shorts--the closest thing to having a naked ass and not getting arrested.  Martin really liked it.", "input": "", "output": "So how is it going with you and Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, same as before--no real changes.  Well...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Well, remember the big rain storm a few days ago?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. I thought it was unusual for August."}, {"instruction": "It virtually never happens.  But it wiped out Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Wiped out?  I don't understand."}, {"instruction": "Oh, she lives on the top floor of this quiet little Victorian.  The place used to be gorgeous--lots of carvings and contrasting colors--a real gem.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds nice."}, {"instruction": "It was.  But it's owned by this little old lady who lived there for god knows how long--she moved in after she got married, raised her family there, and never considered moving. I think she is very sentimental about the place.  Her husband died there over ten years ago, but she still keeps his office and his clothes in the closet just as he left them.  It's really sad--I think they were very much in love.  But in any case, Mrs. Borderstein is an awful landlord.", "input": "", "output": "Is she being unpleasant to Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no.  Not at all.  Kathy and her are pals.  They have tea together and Kathy sort off watches over her--keeps her out of trouble, so to speak.", "input": "", "output": "That's very nice of Kathy."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I have a feeling that you don't think much of her, but she is really a very nice person.", "input": "", "output": "So what's the problem with Kathy's place?"}, {"instruction": "When Mr. Borderstein was still alive, he got the brilliant idea of taking the two extra bedrooms they had upstairs and turning them into a small apartment.  Their children had moved out and they didn't need the extra room, just the extra cash.", "input": "", "output": "And Kathy was renting that little apartment?"}, {"instruction": "As I said, it's real nice--vaulted ceilings sixteen feet high, a bath with iron lion's feet.  It's very sunny.  But Mrs. Borderstein hasn't done any work on the house since her husband died.  Last winter, the roof started to leak--right onto Kathy's bed.  Mrs. Borderstein said that she couldn't get it fixed during the rainy season and that Kathy would have to wait until the summer time.", "input": "", "output": "That's ridiculous.  She didn't even fix the leak?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy lived with rotating buckets for two month.  Mrs. Borderstein would even come into her place during the day to check if they needed to be emptied out.  But the summer came and she never bothered to do anything about the roof--it wasn't a problem anymore so she just forgot about it.  Kathy tried to get her to do something, but it was always, \"I'm just too tired today to call the contractor.\" Or, \"I'm running just a bit short of cash this week.\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Finally, after this last storm, Kathy told her that she would have to fix the place or she'd move out.  Mrs. Borderstein cried and told Kathy that she always thought of her as her own daughter and so on.  But she never did call to get the roof fixed.  And Kathy's bed is totally ruined--she had to work all day that day and by the time she got home, the mattress was completely soaked and so were the blankets, the bedspread, the sheets, the works.  We helped drag Kathy's mattress two stories down to try to dry it in the sun in the backyard.  But I think it is ruined--it smells bad and...well, Kathy has moved in with Martin.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "He has an extra bedroom which he used for his office.  But he is doing most of his work at SII and doesn't really need that extra space, at least for now.  So he had the space, and Kathy needed a place in a hurry.  So it just made sense.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And how do you feel about this?"}, {"instruction": "You mean about Martin sharing a place with Kathy?", "input": "", "output": "Well?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think it's anything I should really be upset about.  Kathy is a friend and she just needed some help.  Martin was nice to her.  And this is not a long term solution anyway. I think when Kathy moved out like that, Mrs. Borderstein got really scared.  I bet she'll get the contractors on that roof in no time.  And in the meantime, it might be kind of fun.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't think it's a big deal.  Don't worry so, Doctor.  I trust Martin and Kathy alone together.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been thinking more about..."}, {"instruction": "The three-way relationship between Kathy, Martin, and I?", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "I've thought about it a lot.  Martin and I went out together the other night.  We saw \"Three Tall Women\"--a play by Edward Albee.", "input": "", "output": "How was that?"}, {"instruction": "Interesting.  Depressing.  It was about a woman confronting herself at three different ages--twenty-six, fifty-two, and ninety-two.  The twenty-six year old was horrified to find out just how much she changed over the years.  She couldn't believe that these older women were her in the future.  And even the fifty-two year old woman was far from thrilled at seeing what she became over the next forty years.", "input": "", "output": "An interesting premise."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, interesting.  But it made me think about me.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "I want to like who I'll become in the future.  I want to be able to admire me and feel like I've accomplished something with my life.  I want to know that I didn't make too many mistakes along the way.", "input": "", "output": "Are you worried?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe worried is too strong a term, Doctor.  But I was thinking about it.  What kind of person will I be after a three-way relationship with Martin and Kathy?  Is that something I would be proud of?  Would I tell my children about it?  When I look at my mother, I know that she is a good woman.  And while I never wanted to be like her--I always strove to be more like my father than my mother--I know that she's lived a good life.  I'm proud of her--I'm never ashamed of introducing her to my friends.", "input": "", "output": "Do you believe that a three-way relationship could make your children feel ashamed of you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'd have problems if my parents told me that earlier they'd had a three-way relationship or something.  Not as many problems now, but when I was a teenager, I would have been horrified to find something like that out about my parents.", "input": "", "output": "So you're leaning against this relationship?"}, {"instruction": "I still don't know.  That's in the future.  Right now, we seem to all be very happy.  I don't know if I want to start pushing, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Do you believe that all ready you're in this kind of relationship with Kathy and Martin?"}, {"instruction": "No.  But I do believe that it would be very easy to arrange.  I think Martin and Kathy are waiting for me to decide one way or the other.", "input": "", "output": "Have they been asking about it or pushing you into this?"}, {"instruction": "Not exactly.  I still have all the power in this relationship.  And I know that Martin will only do what I want him to do.  But there's definitely tension.", "input": "", "output": "I think you need to make a decision, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I know.   It's just that I didn't really know that before.  But now that Kathy lives with Martin...at least I have my own place.", "input": "", "output": "Do you spend much time there?"}, {"instruction": "No.  But at least I have it.  I feel like I could get away from it all if I needed to--it makes it less scary.", "input": "", "output": "What are you scared of, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "Just ending up in place that I don't really want to be...nothing, really.  I'm just talking too much, Doctor.  I think we better call it a day, okay?  I've been working long hours and I think it's beginning to take its toll on my ability to reason clearly.  Don't take what I said today too seriously, Doctor.  I'm just tired, I think.", "input": "", "output": "I disagree with you, Anna.  I think you're thinking just fine.  You've raised a lot of interesting points today.  You should not dismiss them as being irrelevant just because you're tired."}, {"instruction": "I've got to go and get some sleep, Doctor.  I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Take care of yourself, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.  If you don't mind, I would like to get right to it.", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  Is there anything wrong?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.  We are just the happy \"Three's Company\" kind of household.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, Kathy is still living in Martin's spare bedroom.", "input": "", "output": "And you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm actually in the master bedroom, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  But you didn't give up your apartment, did you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  My apartment is my safe haven. There'll have to be a lot of convincing before it goes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  So tell me about your living arrangements. Are they working out?"}, {"instruction": "Too well.  Having Kathy there has been a blessing in some sense.  She's like this tube of Vaseline in my relationship with Martin; she makes everything smoother.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I guess we haven't really talked about this before.  We talk about my problems with Martin and sex, but there are other components to a relationship.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Stop saying that.  You know what I'm talking about--cooking, laundry, shopping, cleaning--the stuff that happy marriages are made of.", "input": "", "output": "Are you saying that Martin is not good at those sort of things?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I know he has talent--he demonstrates it on a regular basis.  But deep down, he's always been a procrastinator and a lazy slob when it comes to doing the house work.  The man is brilliant at organizing his computer stuff--his virtual desktop is immaculate.  But when it comes to putting a lid on a tube of toothpaste, he has incurable mental memory block.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And it's so much more than that, Doctor.  He hates shopping. If it wasn't for me, we would have nothing but twinkies and coke in our refrigerator.", "input": "", "output": "Twinkies?"}, {"instruction": "They taste better cold, didn't you know that?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not really a twinkie aficionado."}, {"instruction": "And laundry!  Martin goes out of his way to avoid it.  Do you know just how many times he's ended up wearing my underwear to work?  Fortunately he's into that sort of thing.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And sheets.", "input": "", "output": "What about them?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think Martin was ever told what the top sheet was for.  I'm seriously considering switching to comforter covers as our bedding solution.  Maybe with my next paycheck, I'll just go out and blow two hundred bucks on new bed stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Have you talked to Martin about these issues?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He says, \"Make me!\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "So a couple of times a week, I order him to put on the apron and do the dishes and clean the bathroom.  You can't imagine how many times I've had to spank him for leaving his socks and underwear on the bathroom floor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I can't always do these stupid master/slave games with him.

I'm usually a lot better about these things. I don't let it get to me as much.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  How is Kathy living with you guys been helpful?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy is a dream roommate.  She is very neat and extraordinary considerate to the needs of others.  Since she moved in, most of my spats with Martin over things like dishes and toothpaste tops have virtually disappeared--she just quietly does things.  She never complains that it's not her turn or that she's doing more than her share--she just sees things that need to be done and does them.  Kathy has been the best thing that's happened to our relationship since Martin and I have gotten back together.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It's strange--it's almost like both Martin and I need a wife, and Kathy's perfect for that role.  So here we are--back to the three-way relationship.", "input": "", "output": "A three-way relationship is not just about doing the dishes and putting a cap on the toothpaste tube."}, {"instruction": "Don't you think I know that?  It's just that ever since Kathy moved in, our lives have taken a turn toward the idyllic.  We have fun together and we take care of each other.

Your relationship with Martin and Kathy could almost imperceptibly slip into the next level, and one day you'll wake up and realize that you're already there."}, {"instruction": "I know what you mean.  It's so easy just not to wear clothes to breakfast.  I don't even notice anymore when Kathy's naked--it seems normal somehow.  I wonder if Martin still notices?", "input": "", "output": "What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "He probably looks.", "input": "", "output": "That's all?"}, {"instruction": "Well...one evening, I got really upset with Martin for just walking away after we all had dinner and assuming that the kitchen will just magically get back to normal.  Kathy just got up and started to clean, but I was angry that Martin didn't even think of helping.  So I told Martin that it's going to be that slave night that he always dreamed about.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "We made him strip naked, put on an apron, and clean.  Every time he screwed up, I told Kathy to give him a few paddle's worth.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was entertaining--Martin got his kicks, so to speak, Kathy enjoyed herself, and I just got to stay back and direct the show.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, that's what I mean by the slippery slope."}, {"instruction": "It never turned into a full blown sexual activity, though.  But I know we were on the borderline.", "input": "", "output": "Did you and Martin have sex that night?"}, {"instruction": "Martin wanted to, but somehow I didn't feel right about it.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Somehow if we did, then the S&M kitchen scene we had earlier would have taken on more of a sexual overtone than I felt would have been appropriate.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I understand."}, {"instruction": "If Martin and I had sex that night, then all the things we did before that would have been foreplay.

I've seen her do it in a coffee shop.  I think I make too much noise to try something like that.

But it's been really nice having Kathy around.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, what I'm worried about is you never making this decision and having this relationship sort of happen to you.  You have to figure out what you want to do.  You can't just let things happen.  If Kathy and Martin is what you want, then make that decision.  But if it's not what you want for yourself, then let them know.  You'll be saving a lot of pain and grief not only for yourself but for them as well."}, {"instruction": "You're right, Doctor.

Did you cry?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I'm not fanatical like some people.  But I think it is very sad.  We did do a death party for her.", "input": "", "output": "A death party?"}, {"instruction": "Party is a bad choice of words, I guess.  Kathy is a Diana fan.  She has all the books about her, and she's collected all the news media and magazines with stories and pictures about Diana.  She's got boxes and boxes of that stuff.  I think this week alone, she must have blown about five hundred bucks trying to buy everything that covered the Princess' death.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that's excessive?"}, {"instruction": "I've never understood people who are that fanatical about their hobbies.", "input": "", "output": "So you think this is Kathy's hobby?"}, {"instruction": "What do you think?  But I could see that Kathy was genuinely distressed over the death.  She's been crying all week and even stopped eating.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "She's not starving herself, don't worry, Doctor.  Her appetite is just low.  She'll be okay in a few days.  And I think the party really helped.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me more about this party."}, {"instruction": "It was actually Martin's idea.  We heard about the car accident first and Kathy was glued to the television coverage.  She got hysterical as she finally learned that Princess Di did not survive.  Then I had to go out and gather newspapers and magazines that managed to get the story in print for her.  Kathy stayed up a few nights in a row watching all she could on TV and surfing the web for the latest news--anything she could get her hands on.  I was amazed.  It seemed so irrational, so over the top to me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Kathy's so level-headed; I didn't expect this kind of reaction from her.  But there she was--no shower for four days, hardly eating, wearing the same black t-shirt, face swollen from crying.  Martin thought that if we could get some kind of closure on this tragedy for Kathy...well, that's how the idea for the death party came about.  Last night, we had about fifty people crowded into Martin's two bedrooms, all dressed in black, holding candles, and singing Elton John's new version of \"Candle in the  Wind.\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "John, a guy I work with, managed to get the new words to the song somehow.  Instead of \"Norma Jean\" it had \"English Rose\" describing the dead princess.  The whole thing was actually very beautiful--almost church-like in its feel.  People were holding hands and crying.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I think it was a good idea--there was a lot of emotional release.  I believe people really felt better.  We had about thirty people from SII there.  And I bet you thought that programmers were cold, unemotional types.  I even heard that our CEO, Mr. Major, went to England to attend the funeral on Saturday.  Amazing, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like it was a good idea.  Usually funerals have that kind of emotional release and achieve a certain degree of closure for the mourners."}, {"instruction": "Well, if Kathy could afford to go to the funeral, I'm sure she'd have gone.  But I think the party was the next best thing.  And I'm sure that she'll be glued to the television watching the real funeral all day Saturday.  Even I'm interested in watching it.", "input": "", "output": "So you had an emotional week.  I thought you were going to go up to see your parents for Labor Day."}, {"instruction": "My mom got sick.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I'm sorry."}, {"instruction": "It's nothing serious--just a bad summer cold.  It seems to be going around.  I probably got it from somebody at the party last night.  I think when people are so emotionally stressed, their resistance is low and they get sick easier.  Well, it's a theory.", "input": "", "output": "I think that's true.  Did you get a chance to think about your situation with Kathy and Martin some more?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.  The princess happened and...somehow that just moved to second place.  It's not that I stopped thinking about it all together, it's just that I was worried about Kathy.  And, frankly, I was pretty upset about the death myself.  Her children are just so young.  If I'd lost my mother at that age, I think I would have been pretty fucked-up for the rest of my life.  I'm not even good at imagining it right now.  Whenever I open myself up to imagine what that pain must feel like, I have to shut it down again quickly.  It's just too much.  Deep down inside, I hope my parents will live forever.", "input": "", "output": "It's common to feel..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, you told me to tell you if I needed to get going.  Well, I think it's time for me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Do you want me to call a cab for you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, please.  And I'll go downstairs and hang out in the pharmacy--maybe I'll find some good drugs to make me feel better.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I hope you feel better soon, Anna.  Have a good week."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis.  See you next week.  Oh no, actually I won't.  I'm supposed to go to an offsite meeting for SII next week.  Can I just skip a week and come back on the Thursday that follows?", "input": "", "output": "Of course.  Try to get an opportunity to get some perspective on your home situation, all right Anna?  I'd like your relationship with Martin and Kathy to be a matter of choice and not just something you slip into because you didn't have time to think about it, okay Anna?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, it's not really like that.  I do think about it--a lot.  I'll see you in two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Anna.  Feel better."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  Thank you again for rescheduling my appointment.  I guess I've been really...I got all my dates mixed up.  I thought this week was the next one.  I feel like I don't know whether I'm coming or going.  I keep losing all track of time.  I'm just stressed!", "input": "", "output": "It wasn't a problem.  So I won't see you next week, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I guess.  I'm pretty sure it's next week.", "input": "", "output": "Well, just let me know.  Now, why are you so stressed?"}, {"instruction": "You know.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you tell me anyway?"}, {"instruction": "It's Kathy.  It's been real bad lately.", "input": "", "output": "Bad in what way?"}, {"instruction": "It's as if Diana's death had completely unraveled her emotionally.  I could see that she was very upset, and I was trying to be caring and helpful.  I never expressed by amazement at how strong her reaction was to the death of a complete stranger.  I was trying to be supportive.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "She's angry with me.  I tried to be nice and understanding, and she lashed out at me.  I'm just not as upset by her death as Kathy is.  I told her that it wasn't my fault that Di died. But she was just explosive.", "input": "", "output": "What made her so upset with you?"}, {"instruction": "She was talking about how she needed someone to be there for her, to care for her, to love her.  I told her that I thought Martin and I were trying to be her friends and trying to be emotionally there for her.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But she accused me of doing just the opposite--I am the one who keeps her from getting close to people.  She said that I was responsible for her being alone.  Apparently, all this time, I wasn't a friend but someone who dangled the hope of a true friendship and closeness in front of her, but just out of reach.  I teased her with a possibility of happiness.  I lured her in and left her trapped--not really alone and yet utterly lonely.", "input": "", "output": "So Kathy thought..."}, {"instruction": "That's right.  By inviting her to live with us, I made her a proposition.  She accepted it and has given herself to us both.  But now I'm supposedly pushing her away.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "When she first started to talk to me like that, I just thought that she was behaving irrationally--you know, she was exhausted and badly nourished, and just emotionally wrung out from Princess Di's death.  But it's been days and things are still bad.  She's walking around sulking.  She's still crying all the time.  She's giving me these accusatory looks like all her unhappiness is due to me.  I even spent three nights this week staying in my own apartment because it was just getting to be too much.", "input": "", "output": "Did you try to talk to her?"}, {"instruction": "I tried.  I told her that I didn't understand what she wanted from me.  I said that I thought of her as a dear friend and that I didn't want to lose her friendship over some misunderstanding.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "And I also said that I never made any promises to her.  I never offered her or proposed to her a relationship other than friendship.", "input": "", "output": "But you have flirted with the idea."}, {"instruction": "Sure.  But it's one thing to think and fantasize about having sex with her and Martin.  It's totally different to actually...and even if the three of us did it together, it still does not mean that we would then become a couple...a threesome...you know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "I do.  But it sounds like Kathy is a lot more..."}, {"instruction": "She's just being too much.  I feel like she's pushing me.  And I feel so guilty watching her sob and be such an emotional wreck.", "input": "", "output": "And what about Martin?"}, {"instruction": "He's been away. Last weekend and Monday--he flew to Boston for his mom's birthday.  But he's also trying to stay out of it.  It's like I'm the bad one.  This is all my decision, and he would go either way.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it's your decision, right?  Martin already expressed his interest in having a relationship with Kathy.  Now it's up to you to decide how you want to proceed."}, {"instruction": "That's not how it really works, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, let's say I was the one who wanted Kathy to be part of my relationship with Martin, and Martin was the one who was ambivalent about it.  If I really wanted Kathy as much as that, I would work harder to get her.  I would pursue Martin to get him to agree to that kind of relationship.  I would...I would...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I would be devastated to see Kathy so upset.  I would care more.  I would love her.  Otherwise...if I don't really care one way or the other, why would I bother at all?  If I didn't care enough to want Kathy and to pursue her, I would just drop the whole thing.  That would be the healthiest thing to do for all involved--no need to force Martin to make a decision, and no need to keep Kathy dangling in hopes of a possible relationship.", "input": "", "output": "So you think that this is Martin's fault for not wanting to have a relationship with Kathy badly enough?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not exactly.  It's just that I don't believe in frivolous relationships--good if happens and fine if not.  I think that if I care so little about the outcome, then why bother?  In order to be in a relationship, I need to have very strong feelings about a person.  Perhaps that's why I'm so hesitant about Kathy--I just don't know if my attraction for her rises to the level necessary for a true relationship.  I don't want to make a mistake with Kathy, because I don't want her to end up with nothing and badly hurt.", "input": "", "output": "But it sounds like Kathy's already feeling hurt through your inaction and indecision."}, {"instruction": "I know and I feel horrible about it.  But is it better to get into a relationship knowing that you are ambivalent about it?  That you're not sure how you really feel about the person?  I think of all those times in the past when I got hurt in a relationship, it was because the man I was with just wasn't sure how much he really cared about me.  Those men sensed my interest and went for it before they even thought about how they felt.  I think that maybe for men it's more about having sex, at least in the beginning--I'm sort of interested and she's willing, so why not?  I think that maybe Martin is like that now with Kathy.  Kathy's willing and I might be, so why not?  But I need real feelings.  Feelings that go way beyond just friendship and  feeling a little sexual attraction for Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "So you don't want to have a relationship with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't say that.  I just need to be certain that it's the right thing to do for me and for her, especially since Martin is willing to go either way.", "input": "", "output": "I think Martin's priority is to have a relationship with you.  Kathy is second--if it works, it works."}, {"instruction": "But that's what I mean.  It's not fair to Kathy if Martin feels this way.  In any case, Kathy went out last night.", "input": "", "output": "On a date?"}, {"instruction": "With some creep from the S&M club.  I know she didn't really want to go.  I think she was just trying to make me feel bad.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want her to date just to spite me or Martin.  I want her to be happy.  I want her to go on a date if that's what she truly wants to do.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "But I think her motive was to make Martin and me jealous.", "input": "", "output": "Is it working?"}, {"instruction": "A little.  I have to say that the idea of Kathy having sex with someone else is really unappealing to me.  But...", "input": "", "output": "If you're not willing then..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I told her last night that I needed more time to figure it out for myself.  If she pushes, I'll just freak and that will be the end of that.  I know it's frustrating for her to wait, but I just don't have an answer yet.  And I told her that I thought it was a mistake to try to manipulate me by going out with some strange man and making me worry sick waiting up for her.", "input": "", "output": "You were worried?"}, {"instruction": "I met the guy before during one of those S&M socials.  The guy is a true sadist.  He's into needles and piercing and...ah!  My skin crawls just thinking about him.  I haven't seen Kathy naked since her date--I'm worried that he might have...I can't think about that.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Kathy knew how I felt about this guy.", "input": "", "output": "So you think she chose him on purpose?"}, {"instruction": "I think so, because she called him, and with Diana's death, she wasn't in a mood to go out with anybody.  I really don't want her to hurt herself or put herself in danger just to scare me into this relationship.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell her that?"}, {"instruction": "I hope so.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "She was crying and feeling bad and guilty for what she'd done.  I suddenly realized that I was put in the role of a man in our conversation.", "input": "", "output": "A man?"}, {"instruction": "It's like our conversation would have been better cast if I was a guy.  Does that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "You were in the dominant position."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I guess so.  It's getting late, Doctor Balis.  I better be getting home.  I don't want Kathy to wait with dinner for me.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy's making dinner tonight?"}, {"instruction": "She insisted.  I was going to take her out, but...", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Okay then.  I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "No, no.  In two weeks, remember?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, yes.  Goodbye, Anna.  Good luck."}, {"instruction": "So we're officially a couple...or a threesome...or whatever.  You know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "Congratulations, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I think it's the right thing.", "input": "", "output": "The right thing in general?  The right thing for Kathy?  For Martin?  For you?"}, {"instruction": "I think all of those.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Would you like to talk about it?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.  I don't think I could talk about anything else, Doctor.  It's like we're in our honeymoon stage right now, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "In fact we even went on a honeymoon trip, sort of.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "It was Kathy's idea, and I thought it was terrific--what a great way to start off a relationship.  We even agreed to hold off consummating our relationship until we were on our honeymoon.  Romantic, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Very."}, {"instruction": "We took last Friday off from work and went away for three whole days together.  There's a little very romantic place up the coast on Route 1 just south of Fort Bragg.  It's a small hotel right on the cliff overlooking the ocean.  They told us a movie had been made there, \"Same Time Next Year?\"  But I hadn't seen it.  In any case, it's a very nice place and...we asked for the honeymoon suite, you know?  But guess what?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "It was taken by none other than Lloyd Major.  You know, our CEO?", "input": "", "output": "I know."}, {"instruction": "It was cool that we were staying in the same hotel as Mr. Major.  It's not like he recognized us or anything, but it was cool.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "We still got a great room.  We asked for one with a giant bed--king size.  And we wanted a hot tub in our room--we didn't want to leave the room for the whole three days.  We were getting room-service and we'd only leave to take midnight walks along the coast.  But mostly we wanted to just love each other and stare out into the ocean drinking nice cocktails.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And the people in the hotel were as nice as could be.  You'd think that a party like ours arrived there every day--they really treated us like the three of us just got married.  But it's close to San Francisco, so who knows?", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad they were nice to you."}, {"instruction": "Are you angry with me?", "input": "", "output": "No, of course not.  Why do you ask?"}, {"instruction": "You look so glum.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry.  I'm just still waiting to hear that you've thought long and hard about this and..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, Doctor, of course I had.  I told you I've been thinking about it almost non-stop.  I think this is the right thing.", "input": "", "output": "You've said that."}, {"instruction": "So I have.", "input": "", "output": "What about the reservations that you had?  Is this a viable long-term relationship or just a short-term fun thing?"}, {"instruction": "I don't do short-term fun things, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "So you expect this to last."}, {"instruction": "I do.  We are good together--better than in any other combination.  Martin and I, Kathy and Martin, Kathy and I--it works best when it's the three of us together.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have a wedding?"}, {"instruction": "No, we're keeping this a secret.", "input": "", "output": "What?  Why?"}, {"instruction": "Too many people just wouldn't understand.", "input": "", "output": "Like your parents?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, before I agreed to any of this, I made them promise that under no circumstances were my parents ever to know that we are anything more than just roommates.", "input": "", "output": "Roommates?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I gave up my apartment as of October first.  And Kathy told her landlady that she won't be coming back--that was very ugly, she's just so dependent on Kathy...", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "We were practically living together anyway.", "input": "", "output": "I thought you liked having your own space and being able to get away."}, {"instruction": "Well, a real relationship is not about getting away.  It's about finding ways to stay together and live with each other despite the small differences and annoyances that arise from time to time.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I've committed to this relationship.  I think it's a mature thing to do.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So I'm packing all my stuff, and we are moving it during the evenings into Martin's apartment...well, I guess it's our apartment now.  Hmm?", "input": "", "output": "I guess."}, {"instruction": "And it's really practical this way, too.  We'll split the rent and all the utilities three ways.  And we all contribute money to the general housekeeping fund and to food.  And it's nice to split the chores, too.  It's a good thing all around.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "The only thing that was sort of a damper on our celebrations was Martin's tongue.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I knew you'd be interested.  Martin is a smart man, but he still can't use a microwave for the life of him.  He was heating up some leftover Chinese food.  He kept touching it and touching it, and it was still cold.  Finally, he just didn't want to wait anymore and stuffed a huge glob of it into his mouth.  And you know how microwaves are?  Some parts are left ice cold, while others are boiling hot.  Martin's tongue was completely out of commission for our entire honeymoon!", "input": "", "output": "What a shame."}, {"instruction": "Kathy and I had to punish him for that of course.", "input": "", "output": "Of course."}, {"instruction": "We tied him to the bed, and the two of us...oh, never mind.", "input": "", "output": "So are you sure that this is what you want, Anna?  Are you sure that this was completely your decision--you weren't pushed into this..."}, {"instruction": "I think I'm sure.  I'm very happy right now, Doctor Balis.  Very.  After I decided to say yes, it was like a giant load fell of my shoulders and I felt liberated and happy and free.  I haven't felt that way for a long time.  I love my family--Martin and Kathy.  And it's a good feeling, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Then I'm very happy for you."}, {"instruction": "No, you're not.  But I will make you believe that this is one of the best things that ever happened to me.  And you know, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "It's all because of you.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I have you to thank for my happiness.  You really got me through some very rough times in my life, and I'm very grateful.  Now that I'm happy, I can look back on my life and see how much confusion and misery there was there--one bad relationship after another.  But no more.  I'm happy now.  And you are responsible.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I'm willing to take all that responsibility.  But it's getting late, Anna, and I'm very tired.  Do you mind if we end a bit early today?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, go get some rest, Doctor Balis.  And thank you for everything.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Absolutely.  Good night, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Sorry I canceled last week, Doctor.  But I got a chance to go and hang out at Seybold--a lot more fun then sitting in the office all day. Oh, and Martin was there, too.", "input": "", "output": "Did you see anything interesting?"}, {"instruction": "Some stuff, but it's not anything you're into, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I suppose not.  So let's talk about your new living situation.  How is it working out?"}, {"instruction": "We're settling into a routine.  I got all my stuff moved in there by the first, and I've almost unpacked it all with a lot of help from Kathy.  That woman can organize!  No wonder she runs the bookstore practically single-handedly.", "input": "", "output": "So you're getting comfortable."}, {"instruction": "I'm working on it.  But I guess you're not really asking me about where I keep my underwear now, are you?", "input": "", "output": "No."}, {"instruction": "Bill was really the only other person I lived with other than my parents before now.  And that, if you remember, was not a good situation.  So I'm trying very hard now to figure out the rough spots and smooth them out before they turn into \"that's just the way things are\" kind of thing.  You know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand what you mean, but I would like to talk about those rough spots."}, {"instruction": "I know.  I'm just getting up to speed.  For some reason shifting gears from work to therapy mode is particularly hard today.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't I ask you some questions and we go from there?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  I'm curious what bothers you anyway, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Is your sexual relationship with Kathy reciprocal?"}, {"instruction": "You don't fool around, Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "You once told me that you were not interested in having a homosexual relationship.  Did you change your mind?"}, {"instruction": "You have a long memory, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Well?"}, {"instruction": "Um, it's not that simple.  In the time we've been together, I've never performed oral sex on Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Did Kathy..."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I let Kathy do it to me.  I feel very guilty about that.", "input": "", "output": "Why?  Did Kathy not want to do it?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no.  It's not that.  In fact, she begged me to let her for a long time before I let her touch me.", "input": "", "output": "When was the first time?"}, {"instruction": "On our honeymoon.", "input": "", "output": "Has she done it again?"}, {"instruction": "The opportunity hasn't presented itself so far.", "input": "", "output": "Is that true or are you trying to avoid it?"}, {"instruction": "I guess it's more the later.", "input": "", "output": "Did you like it?"}, {"instruction": "It was very exciting.  I could see her and what she was doing in the closet door mirror across from the bed.  I liked to look.  I liked how Martin responded--he was very turned on by that.", "input": "", "output": "But how about you?  Did you like it?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I couldn't relax.  I kept thinking about it and just couldn't let go, you know?  I couldn't let myself enjoy it somehow.  I tried, but I just couldn't keep my mind from racing.", "input": "", "output": "What were you thinking about?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, just really stupid stuff.  I can't even remember it really.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I thought about how many other pussies Kathy must have licked before in her life.  I wondered if she really liked it or was she doing this because she was trying to please me.  What if she didn't really like it, but was doing it because she thought I did?  Or because she thought that's what was expected of her?  I tried not to think about that, but it kept creeping up into my thoughts.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I tried to move so that I could see Kathy better in the mirror.  I was lying propped up on the pillows, and Kathy was on her knees between my legs.  I turned so I could see her in the mirror--if I could have assured myself that she was wet doing this, I could have let go more.  But it was hard to see.  Finally, I just moved on to other things--oral sex is not the only game in town, you know.", "input": "", "output": "And you haven't done this since?"}, {"instruction": "Not yet.", "input": "", "output": "Does Kathy want you to..."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure she does.  But...well, it's not like I find oral sex with women repulsive.  It's not that.  It's just...I don't really know, Doctor.  I just don't want to do it yet.  I feel so guilty about that.", "input": "", "output": "Guilty?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we're supposed to be all in love with each other and expressing that love through sexual means.  But I just can't bring myself to do it.  And what's worse is that I really love oral sex if it's with men, you know?  I love doing it to Martin.  I insist on it...or insisted.", "input": "", "output": "You don't do it anymore?"}, {"instruction": "I feel guilty initiating it.  It's like if I want to do to Martin, then I should also want to do it to Kathy.  But I don't.  And so there's a lot less oral sex in our household these days.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Does Martin have oral sex with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "I'm better.", "input": "", "output": "That's not what I asked."}, {"instruction": "Sure.  They do it.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "Fine.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And how do you feel about Martin and Kathy having sex in general?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean: \"How I feel?\"  I feel fine about it.", "input": "", "output": "It doesn't bother you at all?"}, {"instruction": "No!  If it did, I wouldn't have agreed to this relationship in the first place.  Really, Doctor, what are you thinking?", "input": "", "output": "Okay, let's move on."}, {"instruction": "Let's.", "input": "", "output": "How do you deal with your sleeping arrangements?  Are you all sleeping in one bed?"}, {"instruction": "No, that would be too uncomfortable.  Well, sometimes we do.  But usually, I sleep with Martin, and Kathy sleeps in the other bedroom.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Is Kathy fine about that?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  We all have strange schedules--Kathy's bookstore stays open until ten some days, and she has to cover that shift.  Martin and I have pretty open schedules--we come in when we want and leave when we're done, unless there's a meeting or something.  But we have arranged to go and come back from SII together.  It makes sense that we sleep together.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "But it's pretty flexible.  One time, Kathy and I slept together--there was a good movie on TV, and we wanted to watch it.  Martin didn't--he went to sleep in the other room.  We do what makes sense.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  I'm glad it's working so well for you."}, {"instruction": "It seems to.  And we are working hard to make sure that we are all happy with the way things are.  If Kathy wanted a different sleeping arrangement, I'm sure she would talk to us about it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Just one more question."}, {"instruction": "Go ahead.  I bet it'll be about sex.", "input": "", "output": "It is.  When you have sex, does it always have to involve all three of you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  It's very flexible, too.  If I wake up in the middle of the night and want to do it, we don't wake up Kathy.  We just make love.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Do you tell Kathy about it later?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "Do you and Kathy ever make love without Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure it will happen.", "input": "", "output": "But has it happened yet?"}, {"instruction": "No, not yet.", "input": "", "output": "And do Martin and Kathy have sex without you?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm.  I don't think so.  I don't really know.", "input": "", "output": "You don't know of an instance that they made love without you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  There were times when I was just watching and...you know, it was more like there was two and one action in the room.", "input": "", "output": "You masturbated while Martin and Kathy had sex in front of you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Well, we're out of time for today."}, {"instruction": "Good.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see next Thursday.  Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor Balis.  You know?  Today was more like sex therapy.  Maybe you're in the wrong profession, Doctor.  You should do this for a living.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Sorry about last week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right.  Is Kathy back?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  But she stayed with her aunt for an extra couple of days.  She had the flu, but I guess at that age...she's better now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that.  So, you started to tell me on the phone how you were looking forward to spending a few days alone--just you and Martin.   Was it is as different as you expected?"}, {"instruction": "It was different.  Most of the difference was probably more due to working at Kathy's store than from just being alone with Martin.  We worked so much last week that we hardly had any time left to be alone.  When we'd finally get home, all we wanted to do was sleep.  I think Kathy was horrified when she saw an empty refrigerator and piles of laundry.  We didn't eat a single meal other than coffee at home.  But our schedules were wild--we'd leave early in the morning to get to the office by at least nine, then work hard to get out of there by five or six.  And we had to cover at the store every night until ten or eleven.  Friday and Saturday until midnight.  It was an insane week.", "input": "", "output": "What about all the rest of the people who work at the store?  Does Kathy always work so late?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no.  The regulars had to cover the morning and day shifts which Martin and I could not.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "But we did manage to have some fun.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the first night was probably the best.", "input": "", "output": "Last Thursday?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  First of all, Martin didn't show up there until eight--his department had a late meeting or something.  I had to fumble around to try and figure out the register.  Finally, one of the customers came to my assistance and helped me do the sales.  People who are into strange and weird sex are usually very nice.  I guess they get all their kicks out in other ways.  And all the regular customers were very concerned about Kathy and asked me to say hello to her.  It was very nice.", "input": "", "output": "The same customers go to the store several times a week?"}, {"instruction": "We rent out some equipment and tapes.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "But we get a fair number of first timers.  When Martin finally got there that first day, I had an elderly couple--tourists, I think--who wanted to purchase a whole bunch of stuff--handcuffs, paddles, masks, some video tapes.  I had to teach the man how to tie a leather corset on his wife.  I guess you couldn't get this kind of stuff where they were from.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe not."}, {"instruction": "So when Martin got to the store, I had this couple and a few others browsing the shelves.  But instead of getting behind the counter with me, Martin pretended that he didn't know me and that he was just someone coming in off the street.  It was hilarious.", "input": "", "output": "What was?"}, {"instruction": "Martin went from shelf to shelf and kept picking up stuff and asking me what it was used for and whether it was good to lick.  And he was totally getting into his bottom space--he constantly asked my permission to do the simplest things--\"May I touch this, Miss?  May I ask a question, Miss?  May I try this, Miss?\"  And the way he said \"Miss\" was clearly meant to be \"Mistress.\"  So we went around the store together, and I demonstrated all the paddles on him.  And Martin kept saying, \"Thank you, Miss.\"  Finally, we had a crowd of spectators at the store.  Martin was on his hands and knees in front of me licking my shoes.  It was wild.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He was my masochistic customer, and I was his shop girl mistress.  We kept this up for hours.  And this little old lady wanted to try out her new paddle on Martin as well.", "input": "", "output": "Did he let her?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.  She was such a sweet little thing, although Martin did say she had a heavy hand.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So our little performance lasted all evening.  At one point, I sent Martin out to get some food--which he did completely in character.", "input": "", "output": "In character--by that do you mean Martin was..."}, {"instruction": "He was playing a masochist.", "input": "", "output": "So you consider that a performance?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it is, sort of.  I know it's a bit more than that.  But Martin can play a normal person, too, and he does every day in the office.  He's never once licked my shoes while we were at work.", "input": "", "output": "That's good."}, {"instruction": "He does send me some very graphic but also very cryptic e-mail messages.  But we are very careful not to let on as to our sex play preferences at work.  That would be stupid.", "input": "", "output": "I agree.  What you do in private should stay your own business."}, {"instruction": "Right.  But at the store...well, that was different.  There was this strange sense of freedom.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "We were free to act and play out our fantasies in there.  Even though it was a public space, we felt anonymous enough to lose our inhibitions.  The people who witnessed our games didn't find them perverted.  I mean it's a sex store. They enjoyed them and even participated to a limited degree.", "input": "", "output": "So you did this more than just the first night?"}, {"instruction": "We did it every night.", "input": "", "output": "Were you always a dominatrix store owner?"}, {"instruction": "No.  We did that a few times.  But we also played with having Martin run the store and I was a bitch from hell customer.  But in both scenarios--when I was a customer and when I was the shop keeper--I had a couple of men who wanted me to order and push them around.", "input": "", "output": "Did you like that?"}, {"instruction": "It was okay as long as the line wasn't crossed.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "What mostly happened was that customers wanted to be ordered to buy certain items.  And that was cool with me.  Some even insisted on being on their knees the entire time they were shopping at the store.  That was fine, too.  It's when things got more sexual that I drew the line.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe you should explain a bit."}, {"instruction": "One guy tried on this stupid little leather thing and instead of just doing it the way you're supposed to do it--over the clothes and in the fitting room--he came out into the store wearing just that.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I told him that he went over the line.", "input": "", "output": "That was enough?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  He was very apologetic.  He got dressed and purchased the leather thing and left.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Mostly, people were very cautious.  After all, this is a public place--anyone could walk in at any moment.  Doing little things that get your adrenaline flowing but could be terminated at the drop of a hat is one thing.  But the other stuff...it didn't really happen all that much.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you had a good time running Kathy's store in her absence."}, {"instruction": "Kathy said that we had too good of a time.  She said that now people would be expecting these kind of performances all the time.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Kathy always runs the store in a sort of neutral space.  She makes it easy for anyone to ask her questions, and she certainly knows a lot.  That's how I met her.  Who knew that this little Japanese girl was into leather and whips herself?", "input": "", "output": "So besides for the store, did anything else happen last week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  Actually a very nice thing happened.", "input": "", "output": "What is it?"}, {"instruction": "Martin was asked to join the futurist department at SII.  It's part of research and development.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's a collection of Ph.D.'s who try to predict trends in technology use.  I think Martin will do very well there.  And he got a nice raise to boot.", "input": "", "output": "Very good."}, {"instruction": "He'll need a week or two to finish up the project that he's working on right now, and then he'll assume his new position.  We'll probably celebrate this weekend, since Kathy wasn't around to do so before.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have some specific plans?"}, {"instruction": "Not really.  We might go to the \"Exotic Erotic Ball\" tomorrow night.  Martin has never experienced Halloween in San Francisco.  I think he'll enjoy it.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever been to the ball before?"}, {"instruction": "No.  It will be my first time, too.  I might have Kathy and Martin on a leash.  What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "I think it's up to you.  I hope you have a good time.  Just be careful, Anna."}, {"instruction": "You should consider going too, Doctor.  You might meet a number of your patients there.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I know a few people from SII that are going.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Our time is up, Doctor.  I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  Have a good week, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Very well, Doctor.  How are you?", "input": "", "output": "Just fine, thank you."}, {"instruction": "Did you go and check out the Exotic Erotic Ball?  Or should I say the Exotic Neurotic?", "input": "", "output": "No, that's not my thing.  Exotic Neurotic, hmm?"}, {"instruction": "It was actually almost sort of sickening.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I hang out with the S&M community.  Maybe I don't get into a religious fervor about it, but I've been around.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I mostly stay away from the super extreme stuff--branding, cutting, rib removal...", "input": "", "output": "Rib removal?"}, {"instruction": "The sixteen-inch waist is back in style, and it's much easier to get there by removing the lowest set of ribs.  Cher did it.  And I've even heard that Jane Fonda did it--you know, that's the part they don't put on the work-out tapes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Not very funny, I know.  But Kathy told me that quite a few girls that she knows are saving money for this operation.  These women are into corsets.  They bind themselves so tight that they sometimes lose consciousness.", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't think that there would be many doctors willing to do that surgery."}, {"instruction": "A doctor could be into S&M, too, you know?", "input": "", "output": "True."}, {"instruction": "In fact, quite a number of them are.  S&M couples with children have to worry about some state child protective service coming in and taking away their children because of their sexual preference.  It's happened before.  The thinking goes that if they are beating each other, they're probably beating their children.  So a lot of people in the community go to doctors who are part of the community.", "input": "", "output": "Obviously the sexual practices of mutually consenting adults have little to do with how they raise their children."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but a lot of people don't agree.  But back to the Exotic Neurotic Ball--there were people who were into severe body mutilation.  This one guy had his waist bound for a number of years, and now he's abnormally thin in that way.  I was getting queasy just looking at him.  And there were so many--what felt like very young kids- who had multiple scars from self-inflicted knife cuts, or branding burns, or body-piercing rituals...", "input": "", "output": "Rituals?"}, {"instruction": "Don't pretend to be naive with me, Doctor.  I know you're from New York.", "input": "", "output": "I haven't had a lot of exposure to the scene in San Francisco."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure it's the same old shit.  They get themselves suspended by hooks going through thier muscle tissues--real sick stuff.  And these kids were so young.  I'm not even sure they were legal.  Kathy said that a lot of runaways stop at the store seeking some sort of self-emancipation from god knows what.  It's like their bodies are their only way of getting some sort of control over their lives.  Very sad.", "input": "", "output": "I agree.  How does Kathy handle those kids?"}, {"instruction": "She said most of the time, there's really nothing she can do for them--they're going to do what they're going to do regardless of Kathy's advice.  She said that she tries to at least point them away from abusive freaks that pray on kids like that.  But...as I said, I saw a lot of kids there.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Kathy told me about a study done recently.  It seems that a lot of these kids suffer from depression.  The infliction of pain releases endorphans Pain infliction releases endorphins--like a runner's high.  So pain is used as a home remedy for depression.  Except, like with any drug, it takes more and more pain to achieve the same high.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  And obviously it is a very temporary solution to depression."}, {"instruction": "I've seen people totally addicted to branding.  The first time they did it, it took them a full six months to recover.  But soon, they were doing it almost every month.  They wouldn't even wait for scars to heal.", "input": "", "output": "Is Kathy very involved with this crowd?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Although she said that when she first came to San Francisco, she was offered a job--a stage job.", "input": "", "output": "Oh no."}, {"instruction": "They asked her to get branded as part of a live show.", "input": "", "output": "Did she do it?"}, {"instruction": "She told me that at the time she was so screwed up that it seemed like a good idea.  She worked at this place serving drinks and saw quite a number of these shows.  She said that there was an unbelievable high that the performers got--and there were both men and women doing it.  The fear and the anticipation of pain before a performance lasted for days and sometimes weeks.  These people were already in a state, way before they got to the stage.  And then everyone was so focused on them.  The audience took in their every breath, every movement.  Even as they were subjected to this excruciating pain, they were on top--riding the high.  I know it's a contradiction--these people are masochists by definition.", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  So did Kathy go through with it?"}, {"instruction": "She has three parallel lines of scars going across her left shoulder.  They are not very big, but I don't like touching or even looking at them.", "input": "", "output": "How does Kathy feels about them now?"}, {"instruction": "She said that she's sort of proud to be able to know that she could stand so much pain.  But she'd never do it again.  She proved it once...", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It makes me sick to think of her on that stage.  She has a videotape of the show, but she said she never watched it.", "input": "", "output": "A videotape?"}, {"instruction": "They used to tape all the shows and bundle them into S&M videos for sale or rent.  There are a few in Kathy's bookstore.  Believe it or not, they are popular.  People are into watching that sort of thing.  But from what I understand, the videotapes are not even half of the experience of people who actually attend the show.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy said that there was a feel to that place.  It was almost indescribable.  It was as if your body somehow understood on some primeval level what was going on there.  There was a smell of fear and burning flesh...that's what Kathy said.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I would never go to a place like that.  I even have trouble thinking about it.", "input": "", "output": "How does Martin feel about this?"}, {"instruction": "He feels the same, of course.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever talk with him about it?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm.  I mostly talk with Kathy about stuff like that.  But Martin could have been around for some of these conversations.  I just don't remember.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He doesn't have any scars like that.  And he never expressed any interest in that sort of thing.  And when I said that I felt sickened by all the displays of self-mutilation, Martin offered to leave the party.  So I don't think his desires go in that direction, thank god!", "input": "", "output": "Good.  So how has your home life been?  Everything going smoothly?"}, {"instruction": "Pretty much.  Kathy worked a lot last week--catching up on some inventory and accounting.  And I had to work a lot, too.  We have a new project starting, and I'm on the prototype team.  It's fun, and I get to work with Martin.  But it's also a lot of work.", "input": "", "output": "Has Martin changed jobs already?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  He is officially part of the future research and development department--he's a futurist now.  He sort of replaced this guy Richard Watson who died of cancer or something.", "input": "", "output": "Does Martin like his new job?"}, {"instruction": "Very much.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  So it's going very well for you three."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You don't sound too convinced.  Is there something..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, it's nothing.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "Shit.  Last Tuesday, I came home early and found Martin and Kathy doing it.  And...it's nothing, really.  They can make love if they want to without me.", "input": "", "output": "But it bothered you that they did, right?"}, {"instruction": "It made me feel a bit uncomfortable.  But it shouldn't have.", "input": "", "output": "It's not about what you should or shouldn't feel.  It's what you actually feel that counts.  Why did it make you feel uncomfortable?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know of any other times when Martin and Kathy made love without you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't.  But they surely must have, right?", "input": "", "output": "Well, before you walked in on them last Tuesday, did you ever think that they were engaging in sexual activities without you?"}, {"instruction": "We usually specifically make plans for Kathy to do a session with Martin.  And a few times, I've chosen not to be there for it.  So it has happened in the past.", "input": "", "output": "But it has always been with your explicit permission before."}, {"instruction": "I suppose that's true.", "input": "", "output": "So this is the first time they did it without your explicit knowledge or consent, right?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  Maybe.  I've got to go now, Doctor.  It's getting late.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  We can continue our discussion next week."}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Have a good week, Anna.  I'll see you next Thursday."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "Fine.", "input": "", "output": "We started a very interesting discussion during our last session, and I would like to pick up where we left off."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "I know that you're not particularly interested in talking about that--you made that clear when you rushed out of here last time. But I think it's important that we talk about your feelings regarding Martin and Kathy."}, {"instruction": "I was just overreacting, Doctor.  Maybe it was PMS.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps, but I would still like to continue our conversation."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what more to say.", "input": "", "output": "Well, let's talk about the relationship between Martin and Kathy."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "How does Martin feel about Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "He likes her, of course.", "input": "", "output": "Of course.  And what else?"}, {"instruction": "He cares for her, he wants her to be happy.  He likes to spend time with her.  Doctor, I just don't know what you really want me to say.", "input": "", "output": "Is Martin in love with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I suppose so.", "input": "", "output": "Did he ever tell you or her that he was in love with her?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose so.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't know?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think I ever heard him use those words before.", "input": "", "output": "Did he use them with you?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, many times.", "input": "", "output": "But not with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I'm not his keeper.  He can say whatever he wants to her.", "input": "", "output": "Don't get defensive, Anna.  I'm just asking simple questions."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever hear Kathy confess her love for Martin?"}, {"instruction": "She talks about loving Martin and me all the time.  She's very mushy that way.", "input": "", "output": "But Martin never responds to her by saying, \"I love you too, Kathy.\""}, {"instruction": "He might.  I don't pay that much attention to that--it's all just talk.", "input": "", "output": "So do you believe that Martin doesn't love Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "He doesn't...I just don't...it's not the same...", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead.  What are you trying to say?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think he feels the same kind of passion toward Kathy as he does toward me.  But all our feelings are different.  You should know that each love we experience is different from the others we might have had during our lives, Doctor.  So it's not at all strange that Martin's feelings for me are different from his feelings for Kathy.  It would be strange if that wasn't true.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I think I was genuinely in love with Bill.  But my feelings of love for him are completely different from the love I feel for Martin.  So it naturally follows that Martin feels one way toward me and another toward Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Naturally."}, {"instruction": "And I'm sure that Kathy feels different emotions for me than she does for Martin.  That's just how human beings work.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And I feel differently about Martin than I do about Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about that difference."}, {"instruction": "It's like there are different shades of red.  There's very bright red, and then there's more purply red, and there's orange-like red, and so on.  There are millions of shades of red.  Some are so close together that you can't even tell them apart.  But they are different nonetheless. You could test them with spectrometer--the reflected light would be of a different wavelength.", "input": "", "output": "I understand your analogy.  But can you be a bit more specific about your feelings?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if I can.", "input": "", "output": "Try."}, {"instruction": "Well, I think of Martin differently than I think of Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "That would be more purply or more orange-red?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry.  Tell me about the difference in your thinking between Martin and Kathy."}, {"instruction": "Well, Martin is a guy.", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "And because of that, I can think of him as a future partner in a way that I can't think of Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "You mean you can imagine marrying Martin in the future?"}, {"instruction": "Right.  But with Kathy, I know it's just a temporary thing.  Someday, it will be over, and I'll get on with my real life.", "input": "", "output": "Real life?"}, {"instruction": "I'll get married, have a house, have a few kids, go to PTA meetings--all the things that my parents did when they settled down.", "input": "", "output": "So by real life you mean something very traditional."}, {"instruction": "Exactly.  And despite all the sexual revolution and social acceptance of alternative ways of life, I just can't picture myself being a sixty year old lesbian living with Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So you consider your relationship with Kathy as a homosexual relationship?"}, {"instruction": "Don't you?", "input": "", "output": "Do you have a homosexual relationship with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "You mean sex?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "I already told you that Kathy and I did it.  Well, sort of did it.", "input": "", "output": "You mean you still didn't reciprocate..."}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't.  But it's not what you think.", "input": "", "output": "What do I think?"}, {"instruction": "You think that I'm trying to avoid reciprocating sexually with Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Are you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  It's just worked out that way.  I was sick, and she was sick.  Then her aunt was sick, and she was gone.", "input": "", "output": "And last week?"}, {"instruction": "Last week, I had my period.  That's what I was telling you in the beginning--I was just majorly PMSing during our last session.  I bet if I walked in on Martin and Kathy doing it this week, it would have hardly bothered me.", "input": "", "output": "Hardly?  You think so?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  I did move in with both of them, Doctor.  I knew that they would make love to each other even when I'm not around.  That's okay.", "input": "", "output": "Is it?"}, {"instruction": "If it wasn't okay, I wouldn't have agreed to be part of this relationship.  Why are you torturing me today, Doctor?  Did I do something to you?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not torturing you, Anna.  I'm simply trying to understand your relationship with Martin and Kathy and how you feel about them.  That's all.  There's no torture component to my questions."}, {"instruction": "I'm feeling those little arrows...oh, never mind.  I guess I'm tired--too many hours at work.", "input": "", "output": "Are you working overtime?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.  It just feels like that.  It's always hard at the beginning of new projects, before the scope of work has been defined.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So please be nice to me, Doctor.  I'm stressed as it is.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And honestly, everything is great in my relationship with Martin and Kathy.  They can fuck all they want without me, it doesn't bother me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Just because Kathy changed her schedule from mornings to nights to be at home more...never mind.", "input": "", "output": "Do you get to spend more time with Kathy because of her new schedule?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Martin and I used to have the mornings to ourselves. We got up much later than Kathy and ate breakfast together--just me and him sipping Pete's coffee around our kitchen table.  We used to talk and share our dreams.  It was a very special time for us.", "input": "", "output": "Can't you do the same with Kathy there?"}, {"instruction": "It's different.  We no longer can have conversations about our future potential.  Somehow it just doesn't feel right with Kathy there.", "input": "", "output": "Does Kathy want to talk about the future?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But I don't want to anymore.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And I think Martin is more reserved, too.", "input": "", "output": "So Martin doesn't like Kathy being there in the mornings also?"}, {"instruction": "He says he does.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't believe him?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, Doctor.  I want to stop now.  It's time to go home.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  All right.  We can stop."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you next week, Doctor.  And...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I'll choose the topic of our therapy session next time.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Have a good week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Before we begin, I'd like to set things straight, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Last time was very unpleasant.  I really look forward all week to seeing you, Doctor.  I think of our time together as very special moments of my life--bits of reality that I tuck away for my pleasure.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  That's very poetic."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.  But I really do feel that way, Doctor.  This is my time to step back and disassociate myself from real life.  It's very therapeutic for me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you think of our therapy as therapeutic."}, {"instruction": "Very funny.  But you know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "I have to say that I don't think of therapy as a place to move away from one's problems.  Quite the opposite, I..."}, {"instruction": "I didn't say \"move away,\" Doctor. What I mean is that I think of our therapy sessions as...as a mud bath.", "input": "", "output": "Mud bath?"}, {"instruction": "I've never really taken one--I'm not into mud that much--but I assume that when a person is sitting submerged in mud from neck to toes he won't be moving away from his problems.", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid I'm lost."}, {"instruction": "It would be more like he would be gaining a new perspective on them.", "input": "", "output": "A muddy one?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "Sorry."}, {"instruction": "What I mean is that the relaxation a person feels while taking a mud bath would change how he reasons about his personal problems.  That it would...never mind.  It's not important about the mud bath.  I was just trying to explain that coming in here and talking to you changes the way I feel.", "input": "", "output": "What changes do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  Many changes.", "input": "", "output": "Well, try to give me an example."}, {"instruction": "Something that I think of as important before I come and talk to you suddenly become less so after our session.  Things like that.", "input": "", "output": "You still didn't give me an example."}, {"instruction": "That's what I mean, Doctor.  Stop this!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "You know.  This is what you did to me last time.  I really hated last time.  Can we just move past this and continue with our regular therapy?", "input": "", "output": "What's our regular therapy?"}, {"instruction": "Don't play dumb.  You usually ask me about my week, and I tell you how it was.  Then you pick a particular thing that we concentrate on for the rest of the session.  But it's never in the form of interrogation.  It's pleasant and nice.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  So how was your week, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "That's better.  It was stressful.  Kathy accused me of acting strange all week.  And Martin will be leaving for Boston on Saturday.", "input": "", "output": "Let's start with Kathy.  Were you acting strange all week?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "So why did Kathy accuse you of it?"}, {"instruction": "She thinks I'm mad because Martin and she made love without me.", "input": "", "output": "You were upset by that, remember?"}, {"instruction": "Of course I remember, Doctor.  But as I told you and as I told them, I had PMS.  I'm allowed, you know.", "input": "", "output": "So you explained away your behavior by ascribing it to PMS."}, {"instruction": "I started taking these birth control pills, and I have much more pronounced mood shifts just before my periods now.  Kathy and Martin have noticed this before; they understood when I told them that I was acting irrationally because I thought my period was coming.", "input": "", "output": "What birth control pills are you taking?"}, {"instruction": "The little ones, I don't remember the name.  There's twenty eight of them in a package.", "input": "", "output": "If you can let me know the name of the pills next time, it would be good. I try to keep a record of all the medication that my patients are taking."}, {"instruction": "I'll try to remember to bring a package with me next time.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you.  So, why was Kathy still upset with you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't really know.", "input": "", "output": "Did she say anything that made you believe that she was upset with you?"}, {"instruction": "She said that I act a lot more irritable with her than I do with Martin.  And that I've been avoiding her after the...after the incident.", "input": "", "output": "After you walked in on them making love?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But it's not really true.  I've just been very tired and stressed lately.  It seems that Martin is having all the fun working on this new project, and I just get to do endless stupid shit that I know they'll change anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Did you talk to Kathy about this?"}, {"instruction": "Whenever I talk about the project at home, Martin jumps in and starts to rave about just how terrific it is.  He's met with Lloyd Major--they went out for lunch, actually.  Lloyd--we call him Lloyd now--is very impressed with Martin.  He thinks he's got great ideas.  He's got Martin flying to Boston to meet with the artificial intelligence team at MIT.  He'll be gone all next week.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds very exciting.  Are you happy for Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I think Lloyd just likes Martin's cute little ass.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "I heard a rumor he was gay.  But he's got a wife, so...I know I sound resentful, Doctor.  It's just been very stressful for me lately.  And before you ask, I don't really know why.  It just has been, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Do you like Martin's project?"}, {"instruction": "I don't really know much about it.  I mean I know some parts--the stuff I've been assigned to code.  But Martin told me that his ideas are still kind of rough, and when he's thought things out better, he'll try to explain it to me.  He had no problems talking to Lloyd about it, though.", "input": "", "output": "But he has to talk to Lloyd to get his project approved, right?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose so.  I am really happy for him.  He's doing what he always wanted to do, and that's great.", "input": "", "output": "And how about you?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, I really love my profession, too.  I like the \"solving the puzzle\" feeling that it has and the thrill of getting it right.  I just wish I was more in the \"in\" group.  It helps to understand the goal of the project.  Otherwise, it's just blind programming--what seems like a good answer usually turns out wrong in the large scheme of things.  You know?", "input": "", "output": "I think I understand.  But let's get back to your conflict with Kathy."}, {"instruction": "It's not really a conflict.  Kathy's mad at me for nothing; I just don't care to deal with it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  So Martin is leaving on Saturday?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, great.  I'll have a whole wonderful week with Kathy.  Yippee!", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to try to resolve things with her?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I know she'll try--girl-bonding sort of thing.  I guess I'm really in a bad mood.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I just had an image of oral sex flash in my head, and it just made me...hmm.", "input": "", "output": "And it made you...?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, nothing.", "input": "", "output": "Are you worried about having sex with Kathy while Martin's away?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not exactly worried, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Apprehensive, perhaps?"}, {"instruction": "Licking my clit is Kathy's way of saying \"I love you.\"", "input": "", "output": "Would you be expected to say \"I love you\" back?"}, {"instruction": "Wow, look at the time.  I'm just amazed at how time flies when you're having fun.  I think I better go and try to wipe the mud off before getting home to my lovely family.", "input": "", "output": "All right, we can end for today."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.  I feel so refreshed and rejuvenated.  Maybe I'll get Kathy to give me a few lashes for good measure--it'll make me sleep better.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week, Anna.  Please take care."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  Please come in."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.  Before you have another moment of uncertainty, the answer is yes.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "You know...", "input": "", "output": "Are you talking about having sex with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "What else?", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So you had sex with Kathy last week.  How was it?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, god.  I faked an orgasm...", "input": "", "output": "And Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  Hers might have been real, who knows?", "input": "", "output": "Did Kathy have a good time?"}, {"instruction": "Why aren't you interested in whether I had a good time?", "input": "", "output": "I am.  Did you?"}, {"instruction": "It's not that simple.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  Why don't you tell me what happened, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Martin left, and it was just Kathy and I for almost a whole week--just us all alone in the apartment, two girls...excuse me, women...", "input": "", "output": "And what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it started to get real weird even before Martin left.  The tension was just unbelievable.  I think even Martin knew that shit was going to hit the fan as soon as he left, and--this was almost comical--Martin just couldn't wait to get the hell out of town and out of the firing range.", "input": "", "output": "I see.   But now Martin's back."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  He stayed away for an extra day.  He said that he had more to do there, but I believe that he was just scared.", "input": "", "output": "Scared to come back."}, {"instruction": "I guess he had every reason to be.", "input": "", "output": "When did he come back?"}, {"instruction": "Last night.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "We have been on our best behavior so far.", "input": "", "output": "You and Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "It won't last long; Thanksgiving is coming up.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have plans for Thanksgiving?"}, {"instruction": "My parents are expecting Martin and I to show up for dinner.", "input": "", "output": "And Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "They are not expecting Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "If you remember, Kathy is not exactly on my parents' invite list after what she's done.", "input": "", "output": "Is Martin?"}, {"instruction": "We managed to convince my parents that Kathy was just having a hysterical nervous breakdown and was hoping to hurt me by telling them Martin is a sadist and that he's into sex with multiple partners and...just tons of crap.  It took months for my parents to get comfortable with Martin again.", "input": "", "output": "They know that the three of you are living together, right?"}, {"instruction": "Well, remember how that all got started?  Basically, my parents think that Martin and I doing Kathy a favor by letting her be our roommate.  We told them the story of decrepit conditions in which Kathy was living.  And I even think that they thought we--that's Martin and I--are extremely generous and noble for helping a friend like that, especially after she tried to ruin our relationship the way she did.  In fact, they think that Martin and I are being generous to a fault.  I know that when we go over there for Thanksgiving, they will try to encourage us to move Kathy out.  They really have hopes for Martin and me.", "input": "", "output": "Your parents are hoping that you two will get married?"}, {"instruction": "My mother keeps hinting at it.  I think she wants grandchildren.  All her friends have some, and she's ready.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, exactly. It's going to be ugly.", "input": "", "output": "Let's get back to what happened after Martin left town."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  As I said, Kathy was already strange for about a week before Martin so conveniently exited the picture.  But with Martin around, we managed to keep it more or less together.  But as Martin's departure approached, Kathy was getting more and more agitated.  She was all but hysterical on the way to the airport.  She tried not to let Martin and I hug and kiss goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "She just hung on both of us and wouldn't let us have any privacy.  Finally, Martin managed to whisper in my ear that he loved me and boarded the plane.  And then, it was just her and me.", "input": "", "output": "How did you handle that?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I said that I had to work overtime the whole week.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "You mean, \"Did I have to?\"  No.  Did I?  Yes.", "input": "", "output": "So basically you ran away from the problem."}, {"instruction": "That's one way of putting it.", "input": "", "output": "And how would you put it?"}, {"instruction": "I tried to avoid the problem.  But it's really a moot point, because Kathy didn't let me get away with it.", "input": "", "output": "What did Kathy do?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the first night after Martin left, I managed to sleep in my office at SII.  But in the morning, Kathy was there.  She said that she was going to take me out for Sunday Brunch.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I felt trapped.  I didn't really have much to do, and I was too tired to come up with a good reason not to go with her.", "input": "", "output": "How was brunch?"}, {"instruction": "It was strange.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I guess Kathy decided to make up with me.  She took me to a lesbian hangout.  This place was basically a bar, but it does Sunday Brunches in a little courtyard outside.  It's sort of a green house with one of the walls made out of tent-like curtain--I guess they pull it down when it gets too cold.  It was actually pretty sunny that day, if you remember.  They had tons of orchids outside.  It was lovely.  But the waitresses were wearing leather outfits with whips attached to loose hip belts--\"Conan the Barbarian\" fashion.", "input": "", "output": "Interesting place."}, {"instruction": "Yes, very colorful.  So we had eggs and some pastries served to us, and at the end of the meal, all the waitresses sort of grouped around our table.  I looked at them, at Kathy, and everyone's smiling at me.  Then they played the theme music from \"Xena, the Warrior Princess.\"  Have you heard of it?", "input": "", "output": "Vaguely."}, {"instruction": "It's a television show with two women characters playing hero Amazon parts.  They dress completely in leather and fight with swords...", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Kathy likes the show, and I've seen it with her a few times.  It's not bad.  So, here they all were smiling at me.  And then Kathy handed me this giant present in a box.  You would never believe what was inside, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "It was a complete leather Xena outfit.  Very cool.  They made me go in the bathroom and put it on.", "input": "", "output": "Did it fit?"}, {"instruction": "I'll bring you pictures, and you can form your own opinion, Doctor.  When I came out, they all applauded and cheered.  It was sort of embarrassing.  Apparently, this bar does Xena Night every Sunday evening--they record the show during the week and play it on the giant TV in front of a very receptive audience.  We--Kathy and I--were expected to come as guests of honor that night.  I have no idea how Kathy managed to arrange that, not to mention that the outfit must have cost a fortune.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like Kathy was really trying."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  She makes it very hard to stay mad at her.  Needless to say, we went to this bar for dinner and stayed for the entire show.  When we got home, Kathy made a big production of saying how she was very tired and needed to get to sleep right away.  She was trying to make it clear that we weren't going to do anything that night.  But the upshot was that I owed her now--not a good position to be in.", "input": "", "output": "When was the pay off?"}, {"instruction": "The next night.  When I came home from work, Kathy was already there.  She was dressed as Xena's sidekick.  Kathy's so little, it almost looked funny on her.  But there she was expecting me to...", "input": "", "output": "...to say \"I love you?\""}, {"instruction": "You remembered that?  Yup, that's the upshot.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "I basically had no choice, Doctor, did I?", "input": "", "output": "You always have a choice, Anna, and you know it."}, {"instruction": "Perhaps I do always have a choice.  But exercising that choice can be a real bitch sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "True. But you have a choice nonetheless."}, {"instruction": "In any case, I got home, and there she was waiting for me.  We had a salad together, and I took a bath.  That took about two and a half hours.", "input": "", "output": "Two and a half hours to eat a salad and take a bath?"}, {"instruction": "I was in no hurry to say I love you.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You know, Doctor, it's getting awfully late.  We should stop.", "input": "", "output": "No, it's okay.  You can go on, we could take a few extra minutes.  My next appointment...never mind, you have time.  Please continue."}, {"instruction": "All right.  After the bath, I put on my Xena costume.  Kathy wanted me to tie her down to the side of the bed, but I refused.  So she got on her hands and knees and licked me as I stood over her.  Kathy is very good at that.  She can always make me come in almost no time.  But this time, she drew it out.  At one point, I found myself pushing her face into my crotch.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And then it was my turn.", "input": "", "output": "You said that you faked your orgasm. How come?"}, {"instruction": "As long as I kept my mind away from the thought of reciprocating on Kathy, I was very turned on and into it.  But every time I thought what I would be expected to do next, I just lost it.  It really is all in the mind you know.", "input": "", "output": "So why did you fake the orgasm?"}, {"instruction": "It got to be too much.  I'd had enough, I guess.  And I just wanted for the whole thing to be over with.  So I ordered her to stop and tied her down to the bed like she wanted.  At first, I just used my fingers and a dildo.  And then, I braved it and plunged in.", "input": "", "output": "How was it?"}, {"instruction": "I hated it.  I don't like the smell and I don't like the taste.  And Kathy is like a gushing fountain--there's a lot of it not to like.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I tried just licking the very tip of her clit, keeping my face as much out of it as possible.  But then she struggled and moved, and I just got a whole...it was very icky!  I almost threw up.  I had to run to the bathroom and wash up and drink tons of water.", "input": "", "output": "How did Kathy react?"}, {"instruction": "I just told her that I got a hair caught in my throat.", "input": "", "output": "And she believed you?"}, {"instruction": "I guess.  When I came out, she was moaning and groaning--she said that I turned her on so much she had an orgasm even without me being there.  And that's the end.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So does Kathy now believe that you're into saying \"I love you?\""}, {"instruction": "I don't know what she believes.  I said that I was tired and went to bed.  She insisted that we sleep together. So I waited until she fell asleep and went into another room.  I couldn't really sleep that night.  I got up early the next morning and was in the office by six thirty.  When I got there, I finally was able to get some sleep on the couch in the programmers' lounge area.  I didn't come home until the day Martin came back.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Kathy just assumed that I had to work late, just as I explained to her before.  It's been a bit strange ever since.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I wanted Martin for myself at least for a little while.  I guess I'm mad at Kathy for making me do all that.  Martin knows that something's up, but he's not questioning.  And now Thanksgiving is coming up.  And frankly, I just don't really care how she feels.  Well, that's all, Doctor Balis.  That's my story, and I got to go home and catch the two of them fucking.", "input": "", "output": "I thought that didn't really bother you."}, {"instruction": "Fuck you, Doctor Balis.  Sorry.  See you in two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.  Life is hell.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?  How was your Thanksgiving?"}, {"instruction": "I just answered you. Life is hell.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Do you want to talk about it?"}, {"instruction": "If I didn't, I wouldn't have come, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I can see you're in a bad mood, Anna.  But directing your aggressions towards me is not particularly productive."}, {"instruction": "I know, I'm sorry.  It's just been a very bad week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about it."}, {"instruction": "Well, I told you that Kathy was not invited to my parents' house for Thanksgiving.  I thought that was perfectly reasonable given her stupid theatrics last time she dealt with them.  If I were in their place, I wouldn't have invited her either.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Did Kathy want to go?"}, {"instruction": "No.  She understood that it would have been bad if she went.  She's not that stupid.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So what did Kathy want you to do?"}, {"instruction": "She didn't want me to do anything.  I see my parents for Thanksgiving every year.  I will continue to do so for the rest of my life.  Unlike some people, I have a good relationship with my parents.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "What Kathy wanted--that manipulative bitch--was to have Martin stay home with her and not go with me to my parents' house.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And did Martin stay with her?"}, {"instruction": "What do you think?  Kathy put on such a show.  She cried, she had hysterics, she threw up.  She used every single trick in the book to try to make Martin feel like a total shit if he went with me.  \"You are my family.  You are the only ones I have in this whole world.\"  Totally untrue--her aunt invited her over, and she just didn't want to go.  \"This is our first Thanksgiving together, how can we spend it apart?\"", "input": "", "output": "But you said that she didn't mind if you went."}, {"instruction": "Of course not.  She knew that I wouldn't give in to that bullshit.  If she didn't try to break Martin and me up last summer, my parents probably wouldn't have minded having her over.  They just didn't want to have another scene.  That's perfectly understandable.  And you have to understand, Doctor Balis...", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "They think of Martin as \"Mr. Right.\"  What they were hoping was to have their future son-in-law and their daughter over for Thanksgiving dinner.  This was going to be the family thing.  The real family thing, not what Kathy was harping about.  My dad was hoping to spend some quality time with Martin, get to know him better. I'm sure he was going to have one of those father of the bride to prospective groom talks.  But...", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "But instead I spent the whole evening trying to explain why my prospective husband chose to spend Thanksgiving with our roommate!  Needless to say, my parents weren't particularly understanding.  My dad kept hinting that perhaps there was something going on behind my back.", "input": "", "output": "Like an affair between Kathy and Martin?"}, {"instruction": "You can't blame them for thinking that, can you?  Kathy did tell them how Martin is into multiple partners and kinky sex and stuff.  By the end of the night, my mom was in tears.  I kept trying to tell her that everything was all right between Martin and me.  But I was very upset as well, and they could see that.  They knew that when I went to the bathroom, it was to cry my heart out.  That bitch!  She was probably fucking Martin all night, while I had to deal with my parents and pretend that everything was all right.", "input": "", "output": "Did Martin know that your parents had certain expectations of him?"}, {"instruction": "Of course he knew.  We talk about getting married and having children all the time.", "input": "", "output": "You do?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  We've been dating for almost a year now.  We ran into each other during MacWorld Expo last January, and I consider that the beginning of our dating.  But we've known each other for even more than that, remember?", "input": "", "output": "Does Kathy know of your plans to get married?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure, that's why she's doing everything she can to destroy them.", "input": "", "output": "Since your plans for the future don't seem to include Kathy, when were you planning on telling her?"}, {"instruction": "I told you--she already knows.  That's why she's doing all this.", "input": "", "output": "But you never came out and actually told her about your plans to get married, did you?"}, {"instruction": "Martin and I are just talking.  It's natural to talk about the future with someone you love, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "It is.  But your situation is more complicated than that.  You and Martin both decided to have a relationship with Kathy.  Now you're planning your future together and it doesn't include her.  You have to let her know how you feel about her."}, {"instruction": "I would love to let her know how I feel about her, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Is hostility all you feel for Kathy at this point?"}, {"instruction": "I just feel totally manipulated by her.  She knows that I'm angry with her for making Martin stay home with her.  But every time I try to bring up the subject and talk to her, she just bursts into tears and tells us just how much she loves us and how her life wouldn't be worth living without us.", "input": "", "output": "Is Kathy threatening suicide?"}, {"instruction": "All the time.  She only lives for us, you know.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  This is very serious, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I know.  That's why Martin and I weren't able to talk to her.", "input": "", "output": "So Martin wants to dissolve this relationship as well?"}, {"instruction": "After I came back from Thanksgiving with my parents, I told Martin that this will never happen again.  I've reached my limit.  Kathy had to go, or we were history.", "input": "", "output": "How did Martin take it?"}, {"instruction": "He agreed that things were getting a bit too intense with Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "So Martin chose you."}, {"instruction": "Martin is in love with me, Doctor. He is not in love with Kathy.  Look, when we started this whole mess, it was fun.  We were all having fun--Martin, I, and Kathy.  When you're young, you are supposed to experiment with life, to try things that you'd never even consider when you're older.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like you're older now?"}, {"instruction": "No, it's not that.  I feel young.  But I don't want this anymore.  I've tried it, and I'm done with it.  It's not working for me.  It's not working for Martin.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure it's not working for Martin?"}, {"instruction": "If he wants me, and if he's in love with me, then it's not working for him, either!", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So you talked to Martin and made the decision to break it off with Kathy, right?"}, {"instruction": "It's either me or her.", "input": "", "output": "And Martin wants you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  You know, Doctor?  I now believe that Kathy manipulated this whole thing.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "It's the way she managed to move in with Martin even before we'd made a conscious decision to live together.  She sort of forced this whole issue.  I bet if she never manipulated her way into living in Martin's apartment, things would have been different.", "input": "", "output": "How do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I think we would have had sex together.  And even taken little weekend adventure trips and explored, you know?  But I think we would have never ended up living together.  It would have been Martin and I as a couple having occasional sex with her.  It would have never been like this.", "input": "", "output": "So do you feel like this is all Kathy's fault?"}, {"instruction": "I think she manipulated us both.  And Martin feels the same way.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Now it's: \"Oh, I love you, Anna.  I love you, Martin.  And if you don't love me back, I'll kill myself.\"", "input": "", "output": "I think you need to get Kathy some help.  It sounds like things are getting way out of control..."}, {"instruction": "I don't believe she'd actually do anything, Doctor.  It's not her way.  She's just using this death thing to manipulate us.", "input": "", "output": "And it's working."}, {"instruction": "It's working on Martin.  I'm becoming more and more oblivious to it.", "input": "", "output": "Doesn't Kathy notice your hostility and anger towards her?"}, {"instruction": "She's just pretending that I'm still sore about Thanksgiving.", "input": "", "output": "I know this is a painful subject for you, but do Kathy and Martin still have sex together?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure they did it when I was gone.  Kathy can just pick up a whip and put on some \"come fuck me boots,\" and Martin is all...it's pathetic!", "input": "", "output": "So you believe that Martin is being sexually manipulated by Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "It's obvious, isn't it?  He's the bottom and she's the top--when it's convenient for her.  Lately, I don't let her do that too much.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "The last couple of times we had sex together, I was the one with the whip.  And, Doctor, I've never enjoyed it more!", "input": "", "output": "Are you saying that you purposely hurt Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "She's into that, you know.  But no.  I didn't really hurt her.  I can't.  I want to, but I can't.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So what are you planning to do?"}, {"instruction": "I'm planning to go home.", "input": "", "output": "That's not what I mean, and you know it."}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I'm planning to have another long talk with Martin and then...I'll tell you next week, Doctor.  I'm tired now.  And I'm very upset.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  Our time is up.  I'll see you next week.  And please call me if..."}, {"instruction": "...the bitch wants to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge.  Roger.", "input": "", "output": "Call me before it comes to that."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  What happened to you last week?"}, {"instruction": "Here.  This is what happened, Doctor.  See?", "input": "", "output": "Is this a Martin creation?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  It's supposed to be a portrait of Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  It has seen better days."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well...I came home early last Thursday and caught them doing this.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Do you disapprove of Martin's drawing?"}, {"instruction": "Come on, Doctor, stop being so dense.  Do you know how long it's been since Martin made a drawing for me?  At least six months.", "input": "", "output": "And has Martin ever made a drawing Kathy before?"}, {"instruction": "For all I know, Martin and Kathy could have had a six months long art fest.", "input": "", "output": "Why does it bother you so much that Martin made a drawing for Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know...I do know.  Martin used his art as a way of seducing me.  And now Kathy is making him use his talents on her.", "input": "", "output": "Making him?"}, {"instruction": "Martin has been too busy to make one for me...", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I know I sound bad, Doctor.  But I feel like I'm in the middle of a battle.", "input": "", "output": "For Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I know he loves me.  And he knows how I feel.", "input": "", "output": "Have you had a talk with Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I took him out for dinner, and we had a very long conversation about our future.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "And we decided to get married next summer.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Congratulations."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "You don't sound too happy."}, {"instruction": "It's like I know that I won.  And yet I feel like I have to keep fighting all the time.  I don't want to worry about catching them any more.", "input": "", "output": "Catching them having sex?"}, {"instruction": "What ever!  I told Martin that it has to stop.", "input": "", "output": "And what was Martin's response?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he's worried about Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Worried?"}, {"instruction": "Martin is afraid that she might do something to hurt herself.  I told him that it's just her way of manipulating him, but he said that he doesn't want to take that chance.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And you don't believe that Kathy would commit suicide, right?"}, {"instruction": "Of course not.  She's not stupid.  In fact, she's milking this for all it's worth.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, she got upset a few more times and vomited all over.  I think she's just like a kid--they can vomit at will, you know.", "input": "", "output": "I've heard that.  But do you really think she's faking this?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, please!  \"I just can't stand the way the refrigerator smells.  It's making me nauseous.  Could you please clean it for me, Martin?\"  She said that right in front of me, and she knew that I just cleaned the darn thing out the week before.  If she doesn't like the way it smells, then she should do something about it.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It's a bunch of things like that, Doctor.  And I'm not just being super sensitive.  She really is totally manipulative.", "input": "", "output": "So how are you planning on letting her know about your wedding plans?"}, {"instruction": "By invitation?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?  No, we decided to tell her after the holidays.", "input": "", "output": "Why are you waiting?"}, {"instruction": "Martin insisted.  He said that people are at their most vulnerable at these times and we should try to be sensitive to that.", "input": "", "output": "And how do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "I can wait the thirteen days.", "input": "", "output": "And what about Christmas dinner?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, Martin came up with a good solution for that.", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "We'll have it over our house.  We got a Christmas Tree last weekend, and now it's all nice and beautiful.  We'll cook a turkey dinner and buy some nice desert.  My parents will be happy to see Martin and I so very domestic together.  So it'll be good.", "input": "", "output": "And what about Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "She'll be there, too.  But she's still our roommate, so my parents will expect her to be there.  And this way, Martin and I can spend the Christmas Dinner with my parents as expected, and Martin doesn't have to feel guilty for abandoning that bitch over the holidays.", "input": "", "output": "Are you worried about having your parents interact with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "I'll talk to them beforehand and tell them that Kathy's been mentally unstable for the last few months and that we will get her to move out after the holidays.  I'm even thinking of announcing to my parents that we're getting married, although Martin wants to wait until the situation with Kathy is resolved.", "input": "", "output": "Wouldn't Kathy try to..."}, {"instruction": "Make a scene?  I'm sure she's thinking about it.  But my job is to talk to my parents, and Martin's job is to talk with Kathy.  He knows how much is at stake.  I think it'll be okay--I'll paint quite a picture of \"psycho bitch from hell\" for my parents, so that they'll be prepared for anything that she can dish out.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Frankly, Anna, I'm worried that you might be dismissing Kathy's threats about suicide too easily.  I think you need to get Kathy some help.  Perhaps, Martin could suggest something to her."}, {"instruction": "He told me that he's been trying.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "\"You are all I need.\"", "input": "", "output": "Do you know if Kathy has a history of mental problems?  Has she ever tried to commit suicide before?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  She had a pretty outrageous past.  I think I told you a bit about that.", "input": "", "output": "You told me that Kathy performed masochistic acts in front of a live audience."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's how she got branded.  But I don't think she's really into death; she's just into talking about it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Look, Doctor, we've been very nice to her.  Very nice.  But it's over.  It's time for her to move on to some other victims.", "input": "", "output": "Victims?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, Martin is worried that she might not be able to find a place to live.  Rents have gone way up, and she's doesn't make all that much.  And, for some reason, he feels like he's responsible for making her give up her apartment. And so...", "input": "", "output": "But she was having problems with her landlord."}, {"instruction": "Exactly.  If anybody was made to give up her apartment, it was me.  I was paying five hundred bucks for my studio.  And it was huge and in a very good part of town.  Now, it's worth twice as much probably.  And if Kathy wanted, I'm sure she could get her old place back.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like you were forced into giving up your place and making this kind of commitment to Martin and Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "Well, a little.  But there's no turning back now.  What's done is done.  And anyway, we're getting married soon.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you would be getting ready to marry Martin if this situation with Kathy hadn't developed?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think Kathy has much to do with Martin and me.", "input": "", "output": "You don't?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I understand what you mean--the three way relationship and all.  But I think we would be planning on getting married even if Kathy was never around.  Although in some way, she is responsible for us getting together.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "She was the one who helped me understand Martin and his needs and desires.  Kathy was my S&M teacher, and for that--for how that helped forge my relationship with Martin--I'm grateful.  Look, I better go now.  Martin will be home soon, and I would like to get there before he does.", "input": "", "output": "Are you worried about something?"}, {"instruction": "No.  But I would like to be there anyway.  Merry Christmas, Doctor Balis.  I assume we will not see each other until after the New Year, right?", "input": "", "output": "It's true that your next two regular sessions fall on the 25th of December and the first of the year.  But I'd just like to remind you that if anything happens, I'm always available."}, {"instruction": "That's nice.  But what could go wrong?  Don't answer that.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Oh hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna.  God, you look terrible!  And what is that..."}, {"instruction": "I didn't sleep.  It's all such a mess.  Life is such a mess.  Thank you for seeing me.", "input": "", "output": "I came as soon as I..."}, {"instruction": "They kept asking me if I could just talk to you...", "input": "", "output": "The answering service?"}, {"instruction": "But I just couldn't.  I couldn't talk at home, and at the office...", "input": "", "output": "That's all right.  I don't mind meeting you in person.  Why don't we actually go into my office?  How long have you been waiting for me here?  It's really cold out."}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I don't remember.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I walked around the neighborhood for a while.  But then I didn't want to miss you.  And the front door was locked.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry.  I think I have a blanket somewhere.  Here.  Let's try to get you warm."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like something to drink?  I could make you some hot tea."}, {"instruction": "That sounds nice, but I think if I put something in my mouth, I'll vomit.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was so awful, Doctor.  You can't imagine just how bad it was.", "input": "", "output": "Are you talking about your parents' visit?"}, {"instruction": "That and just the whole damn thing.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you can talk about what happened?"}, {"instruction": "I'll try.  I feel like my mind is spinning.  And I've been talking to you for the last sixteen hours straight.  I feel like I'll be repeating myself.", "input": "", "output": "In your head?  So this has something to do with your Christmas dinner last night."}, {"instruction": "Her timing was just perfect!  I wonder if she got one of those kits to time it just right, you know?", "input": "", "output": "What kits?"}, {"instruction": "Those ovulation things--they tell you when you're most fertile.", "input": "", "output": "Are you saying that Kathy is..."}, {"instruction": "Pregnant!", "input": "", "output": "God..."}, {"instruction": "That bitch!  She did this on purpose.  She knew that this was it for her, and she got herself pregnant.", "input": "", "output": "I presume it's Martin's."}, {"instruction": "And that bastard knew about it, too.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "She said that they were keeping it a secret until after the New Year, but she was just too happy about it not to tell the world--me and my family, that is.", "input": "", "output": "So Kathy made an announcement during Christmas Dinner?"}, {"instruction": "She took one of the old bows from the Christmas presents we'd just opened and stuck it on her stomach--\"I have another present, everyone!\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "My parents just died; they got it right away.  But I was just too stupid.  I was looking at her like she was mad.  But then I looked up and saw Martin's face.  I knew then.  He tried to come and hold me, but my dad pushed him to the floor.  And then everyone was screaming.  I just stood there looking at them all.  She kept on wailing, \"My baby, my baby.\"  My dad was screaming at Martin.  My mom called her a \"fucking whore.\"  My mom never uses language like that.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Then I felt like my knees were about to collapse.  They felt like they were made out of cotton.  I grabbed onto the table and tried to get out of there.  But I could hardly walk.  Then my mom grabbed me and said that they were taking me home.  But I was home.  This was my home.  This is not her home.  It's mine!  Suddenly, I just freaked out and told everyone to just shut up.  I'd had enough.  I wanted them all gone.", "input": "", "output": "What happened then?"}, {"instruction": "She was just wailing at the top of her lungs, and then she threw up.  It smelled so bad, I was going to throw up, too.  I felt like I was suffocating.  I needed to get out of there.  I couldn't really feel my legs, but suddenly I just started running.  I grabbed my jacket and I was out of there.", "input": "", "output": "Did they try to follow you?"}, {"instruction": "I heard them screaming and running down the stairs after me.  But I was just flying.  I don't even think my feet touched the stairs.  It was as if I was falling, but I knew that I wasn't going to get hurt.", "input": "", "output": "What about the bruise on your forehead?"}, {"instruction": "Really?  I didn't know it was there.", "input": "", "output": "It's pretty bad.  Here, look in the mirror."}, {"instruction": "Wow, it is pretty bad.  No wonder people were shunning me as I was walking around.", "input": "", "output": "I'll take you to the emergency room after we're done."}, {"instruction": "It's not really necessary, do you think?", "input": "", "output": "I think we should check for a concussion, although I think you're lucid enough."}, {"instruction": "Great, that's all I need--a head injury.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have a headache?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but I think it's from crying so much.", "input": "", "output": "Can you put your hand where it hurts?  Okay. So when did you leave your apartment?"}, {"instruction": "It must have been around ten or so last night.", "input": "", "output": "Where did you spend the night?"}, {"instruction": "I went to a park for a while.  I even hoped that...no, you'll freak.", "input": "", "output": "What were you hoping for?"}, {"instruction": "Please don't take it the wrong way, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'll try not to."}, {"instruction": "I was hoping to get murdered or something...see?  You did take it the wrong way.", "input": "", "output": "Did you want to die?"}, {"instruction": "I guess...I don't know.  I just felt...I can't really describe it.", "input": "", "output": "Just try to talk, even if just in phrases."}, {"instruction": "I was so hurt.  And I was angry.  I was furious.  He knew!  He knew the entire time we were making plans to get married.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure about that?"}, {"instruction": "\"We just want to wait until after the New Year to tell everyone.\"  Doesn't that sound familiar to you, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "That's what Martin told me: \"Let's wait until after the New Year to tell everyone.  Holidays are difficult times for people, Kathy might not bear the news well.\"  But what about me?  Me!  Why me?  Why?  I know he loves me, Doctor.  So why?", "input": "", "output": "It might not have been his choice.  What type of contraceptive was Kathy using?"}, {"instruction": "I think she had an IUD.  I guess if she took it out, we wouldn't have known about it.", "input": "", "output": "Did Martin try to talk to you?"}, {"instruction": "I told you what happened--they were all just screaming.  I don't remember what they were saying.  I could hear the blood rushing to my head.  There was pounding in my ears.  I was dizzy.  And then I was on the stairs.  And then...I don't really remember much until I was sitting on the park benching thinking about the murder: \"A twenty seven year old white female programmer was found brutally murdered in...\"", "input": "", "output": "You were thinking about your obituary?"}, {"instruction": "That would be a hell of a way to find out that I'm dead, wouldn't it?", "input": "", "output": "So you wanted to hurt them by dying?"}, {"instruction": "It's just as if I was watching a movie, and it was starring me and my life.  \"She died young, but her life was full...\"", "input": "", "output": "Do you still feel this way?"}, {"instruction": "Do you mean do I still want to be murdered?", "input": "", "output": "Do you?"}, {"instruction": "No, of course not.

And you're right.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Martin might not have known that she was trying to get pregnant.  She's like poison.  She got into our lives through a small crack and then went in straight for the kill.", "input": "", "output": "I would like to take you the hospital right now, Anna.  Then, I would like to talk to you about what you're going to do next."}, {"instruction": "I think I know what I'm going to do.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I'm going to go home.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "It's my home and I'm going to fight for it.  And I think I want to talk to Martin.  Alone.", "input": "", "output": "I think talking to Martin is a good idea."}, {"instruction": "I need to know just what his plans are now.  Is it going to be me or her?  And then I want her out of my home, preferably by tonight.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Look, let's go to the hospital.  You can decide what you're going to do from there."}, {"instruction": "I feel really sleepy, Doctor.  Suddenly, I just don't feel like I can stay awake.", "input": "", "output": "We'll take a cab.  It's just five minutes from here.  Let's go."}, {"instruction": "I'm really tired, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay.  You can close your eyes in the cab."}, {"instruction": "Oh, let me see...life's hell, home's worse, work's okay.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So let's start with home.  What's going on?  Is Kathy still there?"}, {"instruction": "What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Good answer.  Yes, she is.", "input": "", "output": "So what's your status with Martin?"}, {"instruction": "We had a very long conversation about life and about us.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he's still in love with me and doesn't want to lose me.", "input": "", "output": "And do you believe him?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, I do.", "input": "", "output": "What about Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "She's still throwing up.  For a while there, I thought that she might just be faking it, you know?  I thought she was pretending to be pregnant to keep a grip on the relationship.", "input": "", "output": "But you believe she's pregnant now?"}, {"instruction": "I insisted that we all go to her doctor's appointment and verify her claim.  Well, I saw the thing on the ultrasound.  It's there.  That bitch is in fact pregnant.  You know, I should have seen it coming.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "She had no chance.  No chance at all.  So she arranged to be alone with Martin and fucked him until...well, now it's all a big mess.", "input": "", "output": "How does Martin feel about Kathy's pregnancy?"}, {"instruction": "He's freaked.  I think it was all just too surreal for him.  I guess he thought that it might just go away on it's own or something.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But when we went to the OBGYN...well, it just hit him hard, I guess.  He was all white and shaking.  The doctor even made him sit down and got the nurse to bring him some water.  I guess it's not the first time he saw a man lose it at the sight of his own fetus.", "input": "", "output": "And how did you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I felt a lot of things, Doctor.  I was angry...furious.  I felt trapped.  I felt dizzy.  My stomach cramped up.  And, more than anything, I wanted that thing dead.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Martin told me that he tried to raise the issue of an abortion with Kathy.  He told her that he felt too young to be responsible for another life.", "input": "", "output": "And what was Kathy's reaction?"}, {"instruction": "He never actually used the word abortion.  He just maneuvered around the issue.  I know that she knew what he was doing, but she never let on.  Martin said that she just refused to understand his hints.  But I think she understood just fine.", "input": "", "output": "So Kathy is not interested in getting an abortion."}, {"instruction": "No, she's going to extort as much out of this as she can.", "input": "", "output": "You don't think that she wants this baby?"}, {"instruction": "I think she wants the power that this baby will bring to her.  But no, I don't really think that if she wasn't part of our relationship, she would be going out to get herself knocked up right now.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps that's true.  But she was...is in a relationship. And it might be that she actually considered it serious enough..."}, {"instruction": "Whose side are you on anyway?", "input": "", "output": "I'm..."}, {"instruction": "This is total manipulation on Kathy's part.  And this is not just my opinion either.", "input": "", "output": "It's..."}, {"instruction": "Martin is very strongly against this pregnancy, too.  But we just can't force her to have an abortion.  So we have to carefully figure it out.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by that?"}, {"instruction": "If it was up to me, Doctor, I would have thrown out that floozy regardless.  But Martin does feel responsible.  Although frankly, I don't think he's to blame.  She did make representations that she was on birth control.  So she lied and cheated her way into this.  Martin is completely innocent.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But his innocence aside, we still have a problem.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you do."}, {"instruction": "I'm not denying it, Doctor.  I'm really focused on this situation.", "input": "", "output": "So what is your plan?  You obviously have one."}, {"instruction": "It's not that simple.  Martin's greatest concern right now is that she will carry his baby to term.", "input": "", "output": "Is there a problem with that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she was suicidal...", "input": "", "output": "Anna, if that's at all an issue..."}, {"instruction": "I don't think it is.  But what Martin is worried about is that, once the baby is born, Kathy is very likely to abuse it.  She was abused as a kid.  She ran away from home when she was twelve and lived on the street for a while.  Then she lived with her aunt for a few years.  But as soon as she could, she left her and came out to San Francisco.", "input": "", "output": "I thought Kathy's parents were dead."}, {"instruction": "She keeps changing her story, but as of today, her mom died of breast cancer before she ran away, and her dad was a certified pedophile and sexually abused her.  Now, I'm not saying that any of this is true.  But just the fact that she might be making all of this shit up shows just how fucked up she really is.  She is clearly not fit to be a mother.  Martin is worried that she would purposely hurt his child to get at him.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So if she actually does have this baby, we have to have some control over it.", "input": "", "output": "We?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Martin and I.  We have to have legal rights to the child.  Now, at this point, Kathy is willing to sign anything that would prove to Martin that this is his child.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, and?"}, {"instruction": "So legally, Martin has all the rights of a father.  Given that he will be in a steady married relationship and with a job, he is a much better candidate for the custody of this kid.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Kathy is a known drug user, without a good job or a place to live--after the baby is born, of course.", "input": "", "output": "So let me get this straight.  Your plan is to live together with Kathy until the baby is born, then get married to Martin and file for custody of his child.  Did I get it right?"}, {"instruction": "More or less.", "input": "", "output": "What's the less part?"}, {"instruction": "I want to be married as soon as possible.  It could be a secret marriage.  We could do the whole wedding thing after the baby is born.", "input": "", "output": "And how does Martin feel about this plan?"}, {"instruction": "He's fine with it.", "input": "", "output": "Does he know about it?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You don't sound so convincing."}, {"instruction": "Right now, Martin is just too out of it to be able to think clearly.", "input": "", "output": "So you are doing all the thinking for both...for the three of you."}, {"instruction": "Look, Doctor, if Martin gets involved with Kathy he will regret it.  Maybe not immediately, but some day he'll be really sorry.  And then what?  The baby--if it's still just one baby by then--will still be in jeopardy while it's in Kathy's possession.  And it might be a lot harder to wrestle it away from her by then. And...", "input": "", "output": "Hold on. Hold on, Anna.  Aside from all of the rest, are you sure that what you want is to be a mother of Kathy's and Martin's child?  From the way you're talking, you're not even expressing a lot of compassion for it..."}, {"instruction": "I'm just angry at Kathy.  It will pass.  God, look at the time.  I've got to go, Doctor--there's no reason to give that witch a chance at being alone with Martin.  He's just not strong enough for that.", "input": "", "output": "But, Anna...well, okay.  I'll be gone on vacation for the next two weeks and so..."}, {"instruction": "It's not a problem, Doctor.  I know what to do.  And I have my life pretty well under control right now.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, well, as I was saying.  I can be reached in emergencies--just call my answering service.  There's a doctor on call..."}, {"instruction": "I don't care to talk to anyone but you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  Please try to think things through before acting, all right?  And we'll get back to our conversation as soon as I'm back from Hawaii."}, {"instruction": "Hawaii, hmm?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Good for you.  I wish I was going.  Okay, I'll see you in two weeks, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "That's January 29th, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah, I got to go now.  See you.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. I would suggest keeping your distance from me for today.", "input": "", "output": "Why?  Are you still ill?"}, {"instruction": "I'm better.  But I still feel pretty shitty.  I have a cough and a slight fever.  So don't take any chances.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you for the warning.  I didn't realize that you were so sick. How long have you had this thing?"}, {"instruction": "It's over a week now.  But it's much, much better. And actually, I'm in no hurry, you know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "No, I'm not sure I do.  Do you want to be sick?"}, {"instruction": "It got Kathy out of the house.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "She was so freaked out about her baby.  She made a big fuss.  Martin got all upset.  But I wasn't going to go anywhere with a 104 fever.  She doesn't like it, she gets to go.  It's only fair.", "input": "", "output": "So Kathy is not living with you anymore?"}, {"instruction": "I wish.  No, she's only out until I get better.  So no hurry, right?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  And where is Martin?"}, {"instruction": "He's between a rock and a hard place, metaphorically speaking.", "input": "", "output": "Is he living with you at the apartment?"}, {"instruction": "He's being a good boy and taking care of the one he loves.  Me, of course.", "input": "", "output": "And where's Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "In Sacramento with her aunt.", "input": "", "output": "What about the store?"}, {"instruction": "Martin is covering for her.  Poor boy, he works so hard.  That's what you have to do when you fuck up.  Or should it be \"fucked over?\"", "input": "", "output": "You sound bitter."}, {"instruction": "I guess I am.  I've just had it, Doctor.  I'm very tired.", "input": "", "output": "Have you made any plans..."}, {"instruction": "I don't really know anymore, Doctor.  I care about Martin, I really do.  And I do love him.  But I'm stuck watching him make one horrible mistake after another.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "He just can't let go.  Kathy has total control over him.  She's beginning to show already, and she dresses to accentuate her condition.  She's being moody and abusive, but Martin attends to her like he was her personal slave.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's like she managed to carry his S&M tendencies over into our everyday life.  It's very painful to watch.  This last week and a half has been a godsend.", "input": "", "output": "You mean while you were sick?"}, {"instruction": "I know it sounds strange.  I was very ill.  But with Kathy gone, I could feel this enormous pressure lifted.  Martin gets up very early and leaves for the office, then from there he goes straight to the store and comes home around midnight.  But even with this insane schedule and taking care of me, he has been happier than he has been for the last two months.  And we have a chance to talk openly.", "input": "", "output": "What do you talk about?"}, {"instruction": "We're trying to figure out what will happen.  I feel really guilty about this, Doctor, but sometimes I just feel like getting out of this whole mess.  I feel like I can't take it anymore.  But then I look at Martin and I feel guilty.", "input": "", "output": "Why would you feel guilty?"}, {"instruction": "If I left now, it would be the end for Martin.  He could never get out.  He doesn't love her.  I even believe that he might hate her at this point.  But he could never leave his child, and she would do everything in her power to have control over this baby.  This baby is her ticket to a good life.  You know, she started cutting out articles on child abuse and giving them to Martin? Or sometimes, she'd just bring up the topic of child mutilation and talk about it with him.  And while she doesn't actually say it, she means it as a threat: \"See Martin, all these women were abandoned by the father of their children to raise the kids on their own.\" She has taken to describing gruesome details about how she was abused as a child lately.  Martin can barely stand this.  He would sacrifice his life to save his child from such a fate.  So while I stay, there's still a glimmer of hope that we can somehow manage to take his child away from her and raise it as our own.  But if I'm gone...", "input": "", "output": "I don't..."}, {"instruction": "I know what you want to say, Doctor.  Martin is a big boy; he has to live his own life.  But I love him.  I would hate to live my life knowing that he's miserable.  His life is bad enough as it is now.  You know everyone at work knows about Kathy?", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Remember Caren and Greg?", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  They are married now, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It was a nice wedding.  In any case, we sort of drifted apart after Martin came into the picture.  They never understood my willingness to do \"those things.\"", "input": "", "output": "Those things?"}, {"instruction": "They were totally freaked by my experiment with Gray--the whip master?", "input": "", "output": "I remember."}, {"instruction": "I've told them about the baby, and they've been really supportive.  Although their support stops with me and doesn't extend onto Martin.  They think Martin is a real jerk and bad news for me.  They told everyone at SII that Martin, my boyfriend and fianc\u00e9e, got his houseguest pregnant.", "input": "", "output": "Ugly."}, {"instruction": "Oh, it's been really bad.  Well, for me it's been sort of nice.  People are being very supportive and sympathetic.  But Martin is in deep shit.  He's new and doesn't have much history with SII except that he's in the \"futures\" department, and that is not very popular.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, don't get me wrong, I think Martin is useful. And that department comes up with a few good ideas each year.  But we've been doing software design for years without them.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  There's some resentment there."}, {"instruction": "Just a bit.  So Martin is having to deal with some...you know.", "input": "", "output": "So you don't mind that people at work know what's going on with Martin and Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "The way Caren and Greg presented the story, I'm the innocent party.  So it's not very bad for me, however it's going to work out.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  And how have your parents been coping with this whole situation?"}, {"instruction": "My mother is ready to kidnap me, I think, and take me home.  But my dad is giving me the freedom to work things out.  Obviously, he's not too happy with Martin.  And while he doesn't believe Martin was \"raped\" by Kathy, he does believe that she might have created the situation.", "input": "", "output": "Situation?"}, {"instruction": "I told my dad that while Kathy lived with us, I wanted to experiment with...well, with things.  He understood, I think.  And I believe he is willing to make some concessions if Martin handles the situation well.", "input": "", "output": "What does that mean?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know exactly.  But it has something to do with honor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  When is Kathy coming back?"}, {"instruction": "I've been sending her articles on the horrors of Sydney Flu via e-mail.  So hopefully, not for a while.", "input": "", "output": "But eventually, she'll be back.  What are you planning to do then?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I don't want to give up just yet.  And I don't want to live the rest of my life wondering if I made the wrong decision and didn't fight hard enough.  Doesn't love mean sacrificing and compromising?  I can't just let go of Martin.  If I do, he'll be lost for the rest of his life.  And he doesn't deserve that.  I'm partially responsible for him being in this situation...", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I have to disagree with you.  You were the one who was maneuvered and manipulated into a relationship which included Kathy.  If it was up to you..."}, {"instruction": "Perhaps, but I did let it happen and deserve some blame for that.  Look, Doctor, Kathy is going to get her amnio in a few weeks, we'll see what happens then.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  So I'll see you next week as usual?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I plan to be here.  I need someone to keep me grounded.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm here for you."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "And Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "You should have taken me up on my offer.  I wouldn't be in this situation today if you did.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  It's a pleasure to meet you in person.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Mister Fleck.  Anna."}, {"instruction": "Please call me Martin.", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  Please come in and sit down.  I would have preferred that you let me know about this ahead of time."}, {"instruction": "Since Martin works for SII, I thought that he would be covered by the insurance and...", "input": "", "output": "It's not that.  But let's get started.  Why did you want to bring Martin here?"}, {"instruction": "I thought it was about time you two met.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And we're at a very critical point in our relationship.  We have to figure out how to handle the Kathy situation without having it explode in our faces.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by \"handling?\""}, {"instruction": "I think...we think that Kathy is extremely unstable now.  I mean psychologically unstable.  And while the situation at home is getting increasingly unbearable for Martin and I, we're afraid to do something about it because it might harm the baby.  So we need your advice on how to proceed.", "input": "", "output": "What would you like to do about Kathy, Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy is the mother of my child, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "I know."}, {"instruction": "You don't have to worry about what you say here, Martin.  Kathy will never know-- we can have an honest conversation with Doctor Balis.  It's okay.  Really.", "input": "", "output": "Are you uncomfortable talking about Kathy, Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis will never discuss anything that we will say here with anyone.  Martin, you can really trust him.  And I told him about everything that has been going on, so you don't have to talk about those painful things.  We can just concentrate on what we should do now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  What would you like to do now, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "You know, Doctor.  I want my life back.  I want Martin's life back.  I want to find a way to get through this.  I've been telling Martin that if we let this go on like this, at some point, he won't be able to get away.  If this doesn't stop, his life will be dedicated to serving Kathy and her child.  He has so much potential.  So many great things could happen.  But it all could just...all the options...everything good could just go away from his life.  At first, I thought we could wait until the baby is born and try to get custody.  But it's clear to me now that we simply can't wait.  Kathy is getting her tentacles deeper and deeper into Martin, and while I know I would be able to walk away from her at any time, Martin is just not strong enough.  I'm not saying you're weak, Martin.  I just know that your sense of responsibility, your noble nature will keep you from acting in your own best interests.  So we can't wait.  We have to do something now.  That's why we're here, Doctor.  I thought you might have a solution for how to deal with Kathy.  After all, she's completely out of her mind, and that's your specialty.", "input": "", "output": "Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Martin...", "input": "", "output": "Anna, you have to give Martin an opportunity to talk as well.  I know how you feel.  I would like to find out what Martin's feelings are.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Of course, Doctor.  I was just helping.", "input": "", "output": "So do you know what you want, Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I have.  I know it's been very hard on you.  But I don't know if there are any options for us.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "There are always options, Martin.  Right, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "There are always options, but it doesn't mean that they are acceptable."}, {"instruction": "You're not making me miserable.  It's Kathy.  It's all her fault.  I wish I'd seen it sooner.  Everything she's done up to now has been carefully calculated and...she's so horrible.  She's going to destroy your life and the baby's, too.  Don't you see?  You have to find a way to take the baby away from her.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "No, of course not.  I just want you to think about all this.  Staying with Kathy is just not a solution.  I know that you know it, too.  So we have to figure out a way of solving our problem.  I'm here for you.  I want you to be happy.  And Doctor Balis can help us.  Tell him, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not an attorney, but I think Martin is right about custody.  If you bring up Kathy's S&M habits as a way of proving her to be an unfit mother, your sexual practices will be scruitinized as well."}, {"instruction": "So perhaps that's not a solution.  But there must be an answer.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not going to ask you to answer my question with a detailed plan, Martin.  But do you know what you want to do?"}, {"instruction": "If you want to set her up with an apartment somewhere, go ahead--let her take you for a ride.  No wonder she quit her job; she knows that you'll take care of her now.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy quit her job at the store?"}, {"instruction": "She is a great actress.", "input": "", "output": "Do you believe she's faking her symptoms?"}, {"instruction": "She's fourteen weeks now.  Most pregnancy symptoms disappear after twelve.  You go figure.", "input": "", "output": "Actually a lot of pregnant women suffer all through pregnancy.  So don't dismiss Kathy's symptoms solely based on that twelve week estimate."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "I'm beginning to feel like you're not on my side here, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm completely on your side, Anna.  And being honest with you is part of it.  You don't want me to lie to make you feel better, do you?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, just...I'm leaving.  Bye.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I think we should talk..."}, {"instruction": "She's been very unhappy lately, Doctor.  Don't worry--I'll catch up with her on the street, and we'll have a nice evening together.  I promise.", "input": "", "output": "It's not..."}, {"instruction": "It was a pleasure to meet you, Doctor.  Thank you for helping Anna through this very difficult time.  I really appreciate it.  I better run, or I won't be able to catch her.  Goodbye, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Well hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Sorry about last time.  I thought you wouldn't mind, actually.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't like you running out in the middle of the session like that."}, {"instruction": "Well, it wasn't in the middle of the session.  I think we were going overtime already...sorry, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Did Martin manage to catch up with you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to talk about what happened here last time?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "I think we should."}, {"instruction": "I have a more urgent problem right now, Doctor Balis.  And if you don't mind, I would like to talk about that.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Things got really bad, Doctor.  I mean they were bad before.  But now...", "input": "", "output": "What is it?"}, {"instruction": "Martin took Kathy to her doctor's appointment last Monday.  She was supposed to get some kind of test to check if the baby was all right.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not exactly sure what test she took, but they found some bad proteins in her blood or uterus or something.  They think it might be a Down's syndrome baby, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Oh god."}, {"instruction": "It's not for sure yet.  They will do a full-on amnio on her next week.  And then we'll know exactly.  But Kathy doesn't want an abortion.  She wants the baby regardless.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And Martin?"}, {"instruction": "He hasn't been home since he brought Kathy back home on Monday.", "input": "", "output": "Where is he?"}, {"instruction": "He is staying with a friend.  He said that he has a lot to think about and he needs to be alone right now.  But he calls in every day and checks on Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Does he want to have the baby regardless?"}, {"instruction": "No.  He is totally freaked.  He doesn't know what to do.  It's one thing to have a normal, healthy baby.  But this...it's not what I would have wanted.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And I'm totally stuck comforting Kathy through all this.  Can you believe it?  She comes to me--to me!--to cry. She tells me her troubles.  I think for the first time, she's actually worried that Martin might not be there for her.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I told her that I thought that Martin would always want to support his child.  He'd send her money and make sure it's all right.  But what does she expect?  It's not even his love child, for god's sake.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't tell her that, did you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, no.  But I'm dying to.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "I won't.  I think Martin should be strong enough to let her know that.  But she's a real basket case right now.  She hasn't stopped crying since she found out.  And the things she talks about...way over the top.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, she talks about this baby always needing her.  It would never leave her and always love her.  And she would always be there for it, taking care of it, making sure it's okay.  It would never grow up.  It would be just like having a baby for the rest of her life.  She could love it with all her heart, because she would never have to worry about it not being there or abandoning her.  It's all weird stuff like that, Doctor.  I think she's really flipped.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "The more I think about her talking this way about this baby, the more I realize just how sick it is.  She wants this baby to be a mental cripple!  She's actually talking about it like it's a good thing.  God!  I'm thinking about recording some of our conversations and playing them for Martin.  I bet he has no idea just how out of it she is.", "input": "", "output": "You mean recording without Kathy's knowledge?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I know that sounds bad.  But I think Martin has the right to know.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you'll tell him all about it."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  But it's better if he hears it from her own mouth.  I wouldn't have believed that anyone could feel this way, if I haven't heard it myself.", "input": "", "output": "So you think Martin would abandon Kathy if the baby has Down's syndrome?"}, {"instruction": "No, not abandon.  He would support it, but he doesn't have to give up his life for it, does he?", "input": "", "output": "Would you want to continue your relationship with Martin if that happens?"}, {"instruction": "I...", "input": "", "output": "Do you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want to be in a situation where I suddenly become a mother to this child.  Perhaps it's possible to love your own child like that.  But someone else's?", "input": "", "output": "There are a lot of people who take care..."}, {"instruction": "I'm not saying it's impossible to love kids with Down's syndrome.  But you have to dedicate your life to them.  There are people who are specially trained to do the job of taking care of children like that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I suppose that if I had a Down's syndrome kid by accident, I would love it very much, too.  But that would never happen.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  So what are you saying, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.", "input": "", "output": "I think you just said that even if Martin chose you and Kathy and the baby were no longer in the picture, you still wouldn't want to be with him for fear that Kathy's child might become your responsibility."}, {"instruction": "It's his child, and he should be responsible for it.  But I don't have to be.  I want to get a clean slate on life, so to speak.  I don't want to get stuck in a situation where I'm duty bound by something that I don't want to have anything to do with.  What if he dies?", "input": "", "output": "Who?  The baby?"}, {"instruction": "No, Martin.  What if Martin dies, and I get stuck with his baby?  It's just not fair.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So are you leaving Martin and Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Well?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think Kathy should have the baby.", "input": "", "output": "It's not your decision."}, {"instruction": "It is, if I have to spend my life taking care of this child.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't have to do any such thing, Anna.  You're free to leave.  Martin said so himself, remember?"}, {"instruction": "So I should just abandon Martin to his fate?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know. This is your decision."}, {"instruction": "I just can't do it.", "input": "", "output": "Can't do what?"}, {"instruction": "I can't be a mother to that child.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "That's how it's going to turn out if I stay.  I'm not such a monster, you know.  I wouldn't be able to just stand by and watch that psycho abuse a helpless child.  I would have to do something.  I would end up having the responsibility because there just wouldn't be any other choice.", "input": "", "output": "Not true, Anna.  You always have a choice.  This is not your child."}, {"instruction": "That's why Martin has to make Kathy get rid of it.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I don't think..."}, {"instruction": "There's no other way.  Kathy wouldn't be able to take care of it.  And Martin wouldn't be able to do it alone.", "input": "", "output": "I think you should let Martin figure out what he wants to do on his own.  When is he coming back?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Do you see him at work?"}, {"instruction": "Not much.  He is trying not to deal with it at work.  He wouldn't even let Kathy come in for a visit.  He said that work is the only thing that is keeping him sane right now, and he doesn't want to contaminate it.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And when is Kathy's next test?"}, {"instruction": "You're right, Doctor.  This is all very silly.  We just don't know yet.  So why go through hell for nothing?  I'll talk to you next week.  I have to go and feed the pregnant one.  I told Martin I would do that for him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  All right.  I'll see you next week, then.  Please take care, Anna.  Don't make any hasty decisions."}, {"instruction": "I never do, Doctor.  Good night.", "input": "", "output": "Good night."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. Come in..."}, {"instruction": "Before you ask, I have no idea.", "input": "", "output": "No idea about what?  Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "She went to take the test last Monday--she goes to the free prenatal clinic, and her appointments are always on Mondays--and I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "The results haven't come in yet?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  They might have, or she might still be waiting.  She's being very weird about it.  I guess it's her aunt.", "input": "", "output": "I'm having problems following you today, Anna.  What about Kathy's aunt?"}, {"instruction": "Well, her aunt called the apartment last weekend.  She wanted to talk to Kathy, but Kathy wasn't around.  I've never met her aunt before, and I've only spoken to her on the phone a few times.  She always seemed nice to me.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "Well, I just assumed she wanted to know about the result of the amnio test.  So I told her that we didn't know yet whether the baby has Down's syndrome or not.  But it turned out that she didn't even know that Kathy was pregnant.  Well, how was I supposed to know that?  Kathy just spent an entire two weeks with this woman, you'd think she'd have noticed all the puking and whining, you know?  But apparently she didn't suspect a thing.  It was a total shock to her.  And on top of it all, I introduced the whole thing by bringing up a birth defect.  It was not good.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  So how did Kathy's aunt take all this?"}, {"instruction": "She insisted that she needed to come over and stay with us for a few days until we know.  And I said, \"Sure.\"  She's been staying at the apartment since Sunday night.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And is Martin back?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I think it's better this way given the current situation.  He knows about the aunt, though.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I thought that Kathy and her aunt would talk a lot and kind of take the pressure off of me, right?  Wrong.  Kathy has been coming home only to sleep.  I have no idea where she hangs out; she doesn't work at the store any more.  So I'm stuck entertaining her aunt. I've learned a lot about Kathy in the past few days.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "You bet.  Now, let me see.  First of all, her parents did die when she was young, but it was in a car accident.  They were picking up her uncle from the airport, and a truck run into them.  All three of them died on the spot.  Kathy was raised by her aunt, or I should say her aunt tried to raise Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "But what about..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, all that stuff--her mother dying from breast cancer and her father being a certified pedophile--it was a total fabrication.  There was no physical abuse. There was no sexual abuse.  In fact, there was no father figure who could have abused her in the ways that she described at all.  Her aunt never remarried after the accident, or even dated, for that matter.  She said that she tried to raise her niece as well as she could.  Kathy supposedly went to a private school and had lots of psychiatric help ever since she was five--the year that her parents and uncle died.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "She is a diagnosed pathological liar.  She also has some kind of personality disorder, but I couldn't get a straight answer from her aunt as to what exactly it was.  Kathy did run away from home when she was eleven, and again when she was twelve, and then again when she was fifteen.  Each time, her aunt hired a private detective, tracked her down, and made her come home.  The last time she ran away, she came to San Francisco.  She was doing drugs and started to do the live piercing acts.  The cops picked her up one night, and she had a choice of going to some reform school or joining a drug rehab program for teens in San Francisco and staying with her grandparents.", "input": "", "output": "Her grandparents?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, you'll love this.  Remember Mrs. Borderstein?  She was Kathy's landlady?  Well, she is also Kathy's grandmother.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I had a similar reaction, believe me.  She is not actually her grandmother.  She is her grandmother-in-law, but it's close.  Kathy's aunt was married to Mrs. Borderstein's son.  Kathy's mother was her aunt's sister.  So this makes Mrs. Borderstein her grandma-in-law.  Does it makes sense to you?", "input": "", "output": "I hate trying to folow family relations.  I think I followed that.  Kathy was raised by her aunt and Mrs. Borderstein was her aunt's husband's mother, right?"}, {"instruction": "That's it.  Well, Kathy lived with her grandmother on and off for almost twenty years!", "input": "", "output": "How old is Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we all thought she was twenty-five or something.  But she is thirty-four.  That fits with the Down's syndrome, too.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So all that stuff about having a landlady who never takes care of her tenants or wouldn't fix her leak...it was all a lie.  She never paid a dime to her grandmother.  And Mrs. Borderstein tried to take care of her, like any grandmother would.  But Kathy wouldn't even allow her to be called \"grandmother,\" imagine that?  Mrs. Borderstein lost her one and only son in a horrible car accident.  She didn't have any other grandchildren.  And Kathy wouldn't even give her the simple pleasure of feeling like she is her relative.  And after all the stuff she did for her.  That's just so...it's so like Kathy.  She manipulates everyone she comes in contact with.  And she played Martin and I like violins--\"Oh, I have no place to live.  My landlady is just so horrible.\"  Kathy was earning enough money at the store to help her grandmother fix the roof of her house if she wanted to.  This was the house that she lived in herself for free for almost twenty years. I still can't get over all this.  God!", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "She's just connived herself into our lives and took over.  Helen, Kathy's aunt, asked me what Martin's intentions were, you know, regarding the baby.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "I said, \"Honorable?\"", "input": "", "output": "You're not sure?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I told her that I knew that Martin would be financially responsible for the baby.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure that's not all she was asking."}, {"instruction": "No.  She asked straight out whether Martin was going to marry Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "And what did you tell her?"}, {"instruction": "I said that I didn't know what Martin's plans were.  It's true, I don't.  I really don't know.  I hope he's not stupid enough to marry her, but...I didn't tell Helen that, don't worry.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But then Helen got me.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "She asked me if I was in love with Martin.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "I said I wasn't.  I didn't know what else to say.  She was looking at me, and I just froze.  I think she knows that Martin and I were...that we were probably planning to...well, she saw the way our bedrooms were laid out.  I still sleep in the same room with Martin.  I guess it's more accurate to say that Martin still keeps his clothes in our room.  Before he left after the Down's syndrome thing, he was taking turns sleeping with Kathy and me--she insisted.  In any case, Helen noticed that Martin's clothes were all hanging in my room.  It was an ugly moment, Doctor.  She is a nice woman; I didn't want to dump even more bad news on her all at once.  But I think she knows what the true situation is.  She didn't really question me about where Martin was.  So I think she knows.  And Kathy has been such a bitch to her.  She screams at her all the time.  She called her a liar and told me not to believe anything Helen told me.  I saw Helen cry.  I think this is all really hard on her.  I think she thinks it's all her fault--she raised Kathy badly or something.  But I think Kathy is just screwed up and Helen did the best she could with what she got.  I understand that having both of your parents die on you when you're only five years old could completely screw you up for the rest of your life.  But...I just don't know.  And now, I don't even know what's up with the baby.", "input": "", "output": "Take it easy, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I feel like the whole world is spinning out of control.  I have no power to do anything.  Martin just left me to deal.  And Helen is looking to me for moral support and to stand up to Kathy.  And Kathy...I don't even want to talk about Kathy.  I wouldn't be surprised if she went and had an abortion.", "input": "", "output": "Why?  What makes you think that Kathy would do that?  You've always said that she was totally against it, right?"}, {"instruction": "She's just completely screwed up.  Maybe she thinks that Helen will come in and take over now.  You know, take the baby and just deal the way she dealt with Kathy when she was a little girl.  I know that Kathy doesn't want to lose control over the baby, she made that pretty clear last week.  I can totally see her destroying the baby if she thought that Aunt Helen was going to raise it instead of her.  And with Martin gone, I think she's really scared that things might not turn out the way she planned.  She's just completely irrational, Doctor.  She could do anything.  Anything.", "input": "", "output": "Is there any way you can get her to go for some counseling?  I'm sure the prenatal clinic recommended it when they found out that there was a possibility that the fetus was suffering from Down's syndrome."}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I don't think she would do something like that willingly.  Maybe Helen can make her, but she thinks that Kathy is just not certifiably insane enough to be put away against her will.  So I don't think she'll go.  Sorry, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Can you call the clinic and try to find out the result of the test?"}, {"instruction": "I already tried.  They don't give out that kind of information to anyone but the patient.  In Kathy's case, I don't even think Martin would be allowed to find out.  We'll see how things turn out in the next couple of days.  But I have to tell you, Doctor, I'm tired.  This is not what I bargained for when I started my relationship with Martin.  He owes me big.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, he does.  I'm not happy that Martin is just ducking the situation. When is Helen leaving?"}, {"instruction": "Who knows?  God, look at the time.  I've got to go.  It's late.  I'll see you next week, Doctor.  Wish me luck.", "input": "", "output": "Good luck, Anna.  Call me if you need my help."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.  Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  Sorry about last time, I just couldn't get away.  All this is beginning to affect my work and...I just couldn't get in trouble again.", "input": "", "output": "In trouble? At SII?"}, {"instruction": "Life has just been too crazy, Doctor.  But it's not like I can just explain to everyone at work that the reason that I'm so insane is...god, you know.  Well, you don't really.  Life moves on.  You've been out of it for two weeks now. That's a lifetime in the Green/Fleck household.", "input": "", "output": "Really?  So what's going on? Is Aunt Helen still living with you?"}, {"instruction": "No, she's gone as of last weekend.", "input": "", "output": "That's good."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's really good.  I'm just not meant to be a therapist--I don't want to be that involved with other people's problems.  Not that I don't appreciate what you do, Doctor.  I really need you.  Sometimes, more that you know.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Okay, let me start or this session just might not be long enough.  Kathy had an abortion last week.", "input": "", "output": "What?  I thought she was dead set against it."}, {"instruction": "I was shocked, too.  Although I should probably stop being shocked at people's actions and motives, it's pointless.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know what made Kathy change her mind?"}, {"instruction": "She came home last Friday with Martin in tow, and they announced that there is no more baby.", "input": "", "output": "I see. I guess they got the results of the test for Down's syndrome.  How did Aunt Helen take it?"}, {"instruction": "She cried.  But overall, she was relieved and even said so.  She said that she just didn't think she could handle having a baby now.  Kathy flipped over that, and the rest of the evening I helped Helen pack her stuff.  Helen spent the night in a motel and went home in the morning.", "input": "", "output": "Why did Kathy react so strongly to what Helen said?"}, {"instruction": "I think it's all about control for Kathy, control over the baby.  It might be why she got rid of the baby.  It's all such a mess.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "She was gone most of the time Helen was here.  And Martin was gone, too.  I still don't really know where he was hanging out all of this time, although I have a pretty good idea.", "input": "", "output": "Where do you think he was?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Helen got very upset when Kathy didn't come home for a couple of nights.  I didn't know where Kathy was or how to get in touch with her.  I hoped she was all right.  The last thing I wanted to deal with was a suicide or an attempted suicide.  And for those three days, that's what we waited for--a call from the police or a hospital or the morgue.  Helen was freaked at the thought of having to identify the body.  I told her, if it came to that, I was going to go with her.  But she was so scared that she came to work with me for two days.  And that was a total mess.  \"Sorry, Julian, but this woman, who is completely unrelated to me, is afraid of staying in my house because she thinks my roommate might have committed suicide.\"  God, it was awful!  Helen just sat on the couch in the programmer's lounge and cried the entire day.  She was freaking everybody out.  And Martin took off to see his parents for a long weekend, so he was gone.  Not that he was going to be any help.", "input": "", "output": "Did you call the police?"}, {"instruction": "Helen made me go the station with her and help file out a missing person report.  They were no help.  Finally, I thought that I might get some answers from the community.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mean the S&M club?"}, {"instruction": "I hadn't been there in months.  But it was worth a shot.  Helen was really on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  You should thank me.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I considered bringing Helen to you, but I thought better of it.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Frankly, I just didn't want to share you.  I know you must have a pretty low opinion of me now, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I don't..."}, {"instruction": "Let me finish, please.  Whatever you think of me now will change.  Because deep down, I'm a very good person.  And I care deeply about you.  So you will...", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "I'm not saying anything, Doctor.  I'm just...I'm so very tired.  I feel like my mind is racing and I have so little control.  I don't even have control over my dreams anymore.  I used to be able to direct my dreams, but now...", "input": "", "output": "You're under a great deal of stress..."}, {"instruction": "I know you understand, Doctor Balis.  You're my oasis of sanity.  God.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you continue with the story."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, right.  So I was going to go to a party; you know what kind I mean.", "input": "", "output": "I do, go on."}, {"instruction": "But Helen just insisted on going with me.  I don't even know if she really knew about us and Kathy and all that.  Well, I guess she knew where Kathy was working, or maybe not.  I just don't know.  She didn't seem to be too shocked when I told her where we were going.", "input": "", "output": "So Helen went with you to the S&M party?"}, {"instruction": "It was like taking my grandmother there.  I was so embarrassed.  For some reason, I actually wanted Helen to like me despite everything.", "input": "", "output": "Was Helen..."}, {"instruction": "It wasn't like she was mean to me.  She needed me.  But I...it was a very awkward situation with Martin and Kathy and I.  I don't blame Helen for feeling the way she did.  Under other circumstances, we might have been friends.  Well, we probably would never have met if it wasn't for these circumstances.  God, my mind is just so...I'm having trouble keeping my thoughts together.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sleeping all right?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I told you about the dreams.  But I have no idea about my sleep.  And there's just been so little time.  I'm rushing around everywhere.  Everything is spinning out of control.  There is no time even to think.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Are you eating all right?"}, {"instruction": "You sound like my mother.  I'll be fine, Doctor Balis.  I set a goal of four weeks.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "In four weeks, my life will be sane again, one way or another.  I can hold out for four weeks.  It's like being pregnant.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Well, regardless of how bad you might feel during it, you know that it will all be over in nine months.  The deadline of nine months helps.  So I set a deadline of four weeks.", "input": "", "output": "I think I understand what you mean about a deadline.  You feel like knowing that there is a definite end helps you get through the present crisis.  But why four weeks?"}, {"instruction": "I think it's the maximum amount of time that I can take this.  I know that things won't get better in a week or in two weeks.  But four weeks just feels right.  So it's four weeks.", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "So Helen and I went to this dungeon.  Everyone was very nice, but it was way over the top for this little Japanese woman.  I don't think she ever saw anything like that before.  I'm sure she was horrified, but she managed to function.", "input": "", "output": "Did anyone there know where Kathy was?"}, {"instruction": "Someone said that she was performing again.  You know that people will pay even more money when they know that the person being mutilated on the stage is pregnant?  It's just so gruesome.  People are just so gruesome.  She was showing quite a bit.  Kathy is tiny and skinny, and that pregnant belly just popped out on her.", "input": "", "output": "What was she doing?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't want to ask for details in front of Helen.  That was bad enough.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Was the baby in any danger?"}, {"instruction": "I have no idea.  I don't even want to think about it.  But at least we knew she was all right.  I mean she hadn't committed suicide.  And she got rid of the baby anyway, so...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So we were there, and I turned around and saw Martin trying to hide behind this cross set-up thing.  I was going to just leave him there and go away.  But Helen saw him, too.  She went over to him and was going to...I guess she was going to give him a piece of her mind.  But this big woman in an Amazon leather thing pushed Martin down to his knees and asked Helen and me to go.  I was just as happy to leave.  I think she might be the one that Martin has been hanging out with lately.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "There was an air of ownership about her.  I just knew it must be her.  And you know what?  I didn't care.  It just didn't bother me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that Martin and this woman were having a sexual relationship?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure they were.  I even have proof.", "input": "", "output": "Did he tell you about it?"}, {"instruction": "I found this drawing of her in Martin's jacket.  I wasn't going through his stuff, it just fell out.  But it's clearly his style, even if he didn't sign it.  See?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  You're right, I think it's Martin's work."}, {"instruction": "I think he only does this for women he's sexually involved with.  But really, Doctor, I just don't seem to care all that much about it anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Does Kathy know?"}, {"instruction": "She saw the drawing.  She can make her own inferences.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think it doesn't bother you?"}, {"instruction": "I think with all that happened, it matters very little.", "input": "", "output": "Does this mean you're going to break up with Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Break up?", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to leave Martin?  Are you going to leave this relationship?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not even thinking that far ahead, Doctor.  My world is so stressed...", "input": "", "output": "I don't believe that you haven't thought about it."}, {"instruction": "When Martin finally showed up at home with Kathy on Friday, I was just relieved that she was alive.  I don't know how Martin managed to get her to agree to an abortion, but they are both too screwed up to have a kid together.", "input": "", "output": "How did Martin find Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he went over to the clinic to try to find out the results of the amnio test.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy never told him?"}, {"instruction": "I guess not.  She never told me.  Anyway, Martin said that he found Kathy sitting in the waiting room of the clinic.  Apparently, she was scheduled for an abortion that afternoon.  Martin stayed with her and acted like a good and considerate boyfriend.  I'm not sure I believe all of this, but he took her home afterwards.  That's when she got totally weird on Helen and told her to get out.  I think Martin was so happy that the whole situation was over with, he didn't even protest.  It was probably for the best.  Helen was a total emotional wreck, and it was better that she got out of there and didn't get abused by Kathy's post traumatic assaults.", "input": "", "output": "So what is going on now?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Kathy has been oscillating between being maniacally normal and completely hysterical.  Mostly, she lies there, curled up in a fetal position and pretending she's in a coma.  Martin is just thrilled life is back to normal.", "input": "", "output": "Normal?"}, {"instruction": "Well, you have to agree it's better than before.", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "He's acting like we are one happy family again.  Sure we had a few difficulties, but now life is great.", "input": "", "output": "And how do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not feeling for the next four weeks, Doctor.  I know what you're about to say.  Just don't.  Our time is up.  I'll see you next week, I hope.  We can discuss this whole thing ad nauseam then.  Goodbye, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Anna?  Don't just walk out like this."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, Doctor Balis.  I just don't want to talk about anything any more. All right?", "input": "", "output": "It's fine to not want to talk about something, as long as we pick up on the issue during the next session.  But it's not fine to just walk out."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry.  I won't do it again, Doctor.  I promise.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I'll see next week, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.  Have a good week.", "input": "", "output": "You, too.  Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "It's okay to go now, right?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Are you getting enough sleep?"}, {"instruction": "Three weeks and counting.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?  Oh, yes.  So you're still standing firm on your four week resolution?"}, {"instruction": "If I make it that long.  I'm really putting in a lot of hours at work right now.  In some ways it's good--it gets me out of the house.  But I've spent so much of my emotional energy in the past few weeks...oh, hell, it's been months!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I've been working on this project on and off for the last year.  Now, it's finally gone alpha.  The beta date is supposed to be in three weeks.  As you can imagine, life is pure stress.", "input": "", "output": "Alpha?"}, {"instruction": "It's the first working version of the product used for internal testing.  Well, \"working\" is a bit of wishful thinking.  Every day, I get a bug list that seems like it could stretch between the Earth and the Moon, and I'm not really exaggerating.", "input": "", "output": "Is this why you're in trouble at work?"}, {"instruction": "I'm having a real hard time staying focused.  Julian said that I'm generating as many errors as I'm fixing.  That hurt, and it was a really stupid thing to say, because it's clearly not true.  I know that Julian is also under a lot of stress right now.  But...", "input": "", "output": "Are there any longterm consequences for you?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, no.  It's just unpleasant.  Once the product is out the door, things will get back to normal.  I'll probably even get a bonus.  But right now, the tensions are running high.  I was seriously considering just moving into my office for a few days.  I'd probably be able to get more sleep that way.", "input": "", "output": "How are things at home?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy is still strange, but what else is new?  Martin has been moody, too.  But I finally know why.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "The baby was fine.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not following."}, {"instruction": "It's interesting how this just doesn't surprise me.  The amnio test came back negative.  The baby was fine.", "input": "", "output": "So why did Kathy have an abortion?"}, {"instruction": "I think it's completely pointless to ask that question now.  I'm not being rude, Doctor.  I guess I would like to know the answer myself.  But I don't think Kathy is all there.  I don't think even she knows why she did it.", "input": "", "output": "How did you find out?"}, {"instruction": "Martin crawled into bed with me a few nights ago.  He was crying, so I made an effort and asked him why he was so upset.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he can't help but mourn the death of his baby.  He said that it's his fault because he wasn't there for the baby when it needed him.", "input": "", "output": "He wasn't there for the baby?"}, {"instruction": "Right.  He wasn't there period. When he went to the clinic and found Kathy waiting for the abortion, Martin said that he just assumed--like we all did--that the baby was all fucked up.  But after the dirty deed was done, he found out from the nurse that the baby was just fine.  Sometimes it happens that the first test shows an abnormal protein or something, but later it turns out to be a false alarm.  Kathy must have known that the baby was all right for at least a week and a half--they try to give the results of the second test to the parents as soon as possible.  So Kathy knew, and yet she made us all believe that the baby had Down's syndrome.  What a psycho bitch!", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think she did that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  Maybe she was testing us somehow, and we all failed.  Or maybe we passed, and that's what freaked her out.  Who knows?  That woman should be committed.", "input": "", "output": "How does Martin feel about all this?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he was crying.", "input": "", "output": "Did he want to have this child if it was all right?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't think he did. But now that it's gone, I guess he thinks he did.  He should consider himself a lucky man.  He could have had his whole life just flushed down a toilet, but he dodged a bullet.  I think he's very lucky.", "input": "", "output": "Does he think so?"}, {"instruction": "On some level, he must.  He feels a lot of guilt right now.  But that should pass.  Once the air clears, he's sure to figure it out.  I guess he told his parents about the baby.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "He went there to make arrangements to move in with them.  I've heard from people at work that he talked to his supervisor about resigning or telecommuting.", "input": "", "output": "So he was going to leave you?"}, {"instruction": "So, how do you like this weather?  I feel like it's almost spring time.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, what's in it for you now?  Why are you resisting putting an end to this relationship?"}, {"instruction": "Am I?", "input": "", "output": "You're clawing and kicking to maintain a relationship that seems to me to have collapsed months ago.  Why?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  Maybe I'm scared of being alone.", "input": "", "output": "What?  I can barely hear you."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, Doctor.  Why do you think?", "input": "", "output": "I often wonder."}, {"instruction": "I keep hoping to get more energy, somehow.  I feel like I need to get over this hump.  It's like I need to climb a mountain before I'm allowed to leave.  They are not going to make it easy.", "input": "", "output": "Who?  Do you feel like Martin will try to keep you from leaving?"}, {"instruction": "I think Kathy will.", "input": "", "output": "Why would she do that?"}, {"instruction": "Right now, Martin is trying hard to pretend everything is just as it was--that we're still a happy threesome in love.", "input": "", "output": "But that's not what Kathy wants.  She wants Martin all to herself, doesn't she?"}, {"instruction": "I think Kathy is scared of Martin.  When Martin learned about the baby, he told me that he felt this blinding rage.  Kathy must know how he feels.  Martin said that he felt like something just snapped in him.  He said that he felt like he wanted to kill her right there and then while she recovered in the clinic from the abortion.", "input": "", "output": "Why does he stay?  Why is he pretending like everything is all right?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe he is trying to mask how he truly feels inside.  We are all in it so deep.  Maybe he feels guilty for wanting to hurt her.  Who knows?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I think when I leave, Kathy is going to make Martin do something to her.  It's like she wants to commit suicide using Martin as the weapon.  Doctor, I'm so tired right now that I don't really know if any of what I'm saying really makes sense.  Maybe Martin and Kathy are just messing with my mind or maybe my sense of reality is just completely disturbed.  I don't even know if I believe everything I'm telling you right now.  It all sounds so far fetched when I put it into words.  There's just this sense of insanity there now.  And it scares me.  At least while I'm there, I know what's going on.  And things might get better in a few weeks.", "input": "", "output": "But you're still planning on leaving?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But I'm also scared of being alone right now.  Isn't that sick?  I know when I leave, I'll be completely fixated on what's going on with Kathy and Martin.  If she dies...", "input": "", "output": "Do you really believe that Martin will harm Kathy if you're not there?"}, {"instruction": "I believe that Kathy might create a situation or make it look like something happened when it really didn't.", "input": "", "output": "You think that Kathy will set Martin up?"}, {"instruction": "Do you think so?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  And in the meantime, I'm bearing the cross of keeping the equilibrium.  Which reminds me, I think it's time for me to go.", "input": "", "output": "Are you going home?"}, {"instruction": "No, back to work.  I have a lot of work.  And I'm so deadly tired.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Anna.  Please call me if you need me.  I can probably find a good intervention program for Kathy, if you think that she needs it."}, {"instruction": "I don't think she's committable until after the fact, Doctor.  Isn't it always like that?", "input": "", "output": "Just call me when you need to."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's all that sleeping on the company couch in the programmer's lounge.  It really agrees with me.", "input": "", "output": "It seems to.  So how's your life going?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm.  I'm deciding whether I should count last week towards my four week resolution or not.", "input": "", "output": "Why wouldn't you?"}, {"instruction": "Let's see.  I basically moved into my office.  I saw Martin only once the whole week, and I'm getting better at dodging telephone calls from Kathy.  So what do you think? Is it two weeks or three?", "input": "", "output": "I think it's two weeks and counting."}, {"instruction": "That's what I thought.", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be in far better spirits this week, too."}, {"instruction": "All work and no play, and no time home, makes a person really appreciate life.  I'm catching up with my work.  Julian is off my back.  We even had a few power lunches together--I mean the entire department went out of pizza at Tomasso's.", "input": "", "output": "I love that place! I didn't think they were open for lunch."}, {"instruction": "They are if you're having lunch at six in the afternoon.", "input": "", "output": "Ah."}, {"instruction": "So I'm beginning to feel that familiar feeling of being single and overworked.  And you know what?  I'm loving it!", "input": "", "output": "Do you really feel that your relationship with Martin is over?"}, {"instruction": "I think so.  Don't get me wrong, Doctor. When I go back home and lie in my empty bed all night, I begin to feel terrible about it.  But for now, I'm too busy.", "input": "", "output": "I guess that's good."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  And after our product goes out of the door, we were told that we--the team that made it happen--will be sent on a company vacation, all expenses paid.  Isn't that great?", "input": "", "output": "I think it's very nice of SII to do that.  Your project must be very valuable to the company."}, {"instruction": "It is.  But I can't tell you about it.  If I did, then I'd have to kill you.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It's a big deal. SII stands to make a lot of money on it.  I now wish I'd gotten more of those stock options.  I bet I could have negotiated a better deal, but I'm not good at planning for the future like that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "What do you want to talk about, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to continue talking about your disengagement from your relationship with Kathy and Martin."}, {"instruction": "Why?  Aren't you just happy that I think it's over?", "input": "", "output": "Frankly, I'm a bit worried over some of the things you said last time."}, {"instruction": "Well, so am I.  But what can I do about them?", "input": "", "output": "Are you planning to move out of the apartment?"}, {"instruction": "I looked over the rental section in the interactive edition of the Chronicle on the web.  Everything looks very expensive.  And I don't think I want to share my living quarters with anyone.", "input": "", "output": "Are you saying that you don't think you can move out because you can't find an affordable place to live?"}, {"instruction": "Do you want a house guest for a few weeks, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I thought so.  I don't know how this is all going to work out yet.  I didn't even tell Martin of my intentions.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't think that announcing the date of an impending break up is healthy for a relationship.", "input": "", "output": "Healthy?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I'm planning on breaking up, and that in itself isn't  particularly healthy.  What I'm really trying to avoid is all the unpleasantness of Martin and Kathy knowing that I'm leaving.  They'll have their opportunity to freak in two weeks. Until then, why spoil all their fun?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I wish I could figure out a way of keeping the apartment, though.  It's a bit expensive for me. But given what's out there in terms of rent, I could do worse.  And it's in a great area, and I wouldn't have to pack any of my stuff.  I hate doing that.", "input": "", "output": "I can't really see you announcing your intention to break up the relationship and then asking them to move out.  Can you?"}, {"instruction": "Not particularly.  But that would be nice.", "input": "", "output": "I think you need to plan your exit strategy."}, {"instruction": "Exit strategy. I like the sound of that.", "input": "", "output": "I'm serious, Anna.  Maybe you can stay with a friend for a few weeks until you find a place."}, {"instruction": "This couch is very nice.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "I'm just kidding.  The problem is that I just don't want to think about any of this.  I had a nice week being single, and I don't want to get bogged down with all these problems.  If I start thinking about telling Martin and Kathy, I will just flip out.  As it is, my palms get all sweaty and my underarms get tingly when I hear the phone ring in my office.  How much more can I stand?", "input": "", "output": "If it's so bad, why not make a clean break now?"}, {"instruction": "Are you joking?  It would be far worse to just rush into this.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "For one thing, I would have to deal right now, right away.  And I'm not ready for that.  I don't want to.", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to be ready in two weeks?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe.  By then, I'll have a less frantic work environment, I hope.  Doctor, I just want life to be normal again.  I'm tired of being a freak in the middle of a soap opera.  My friends at work don't even ask what's going on with me anymore.  I bet they think that this is all my fault.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think so?"}, {"instruction": "Because it's partly true.  I was the one who went after Martin.", "input": "", "output": "That's not how I remember it."}, {"instruction": "Well, I let things get this bad.  I never should have agreed to let Kathy live with us.  Who knows, if it wasn't for her, Martin and I might have had a normal relationship.  Well, semi-normal relationship with a touch of toe-sucking.  But is that bad?", "input": "", "output": "You told me that you weren't particularly into that."}, {"instruction": "I'm getting used to feet worship.  It sort of grows on you.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And sometimes...", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm not all that sorry that I tried the S&M thing.", "input": "", "output": "No?"}, {"instruction": "There are aspects of it that I liked.", "input": "", "output": "What did you like?"}, {"instruction": "You're not going to like my answer, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "You just won't, trust me.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay. You don't have to worry about my reaction to things, Anna."}, {"instruction": "There was a sexual high--a charge that went through my whole body.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "I liked...well, sometimes, I like feeling like I have no power, like I have surrendered to someone, like I have no control.", "input": "", "output": "That's not what your relationship with Martin was all about."}, {"instruction": "No.  But I liked feeling in control sometimes, too.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Last weekend, there was a party.", "input": "", "output": "You mean..."}, {"instruction": "That's right--an S&M dungeon party.  I wasn't going to go.  But David...remember him?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm..."}, {"instruction": "He was very brief and not particularly memorable.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I think I do remember.  He is also a programmer and, as I remember, very handsome."}, {"instruction": "That's the guy.  Well, we got to talking about this topic late Friday night.  We're all working late now.  So he asked me a few questions, and I thought, \"Why not just show the guy?\"", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I told him that he wouldn't have to do anything, just watch.  So we went together.  Oh, and I found out that I was wrong about that woman--the one in Martin's drawing?", "input": "", "output": "Yes"}, {"instruction": "She's a full time submissive.", "input": "", "output": "I wondered about that--she didn't look like a dominant to me."}, {"instruction": "I don't know why Martin made her portrait.  I don't think it was about sex with them.", "input": "", "output": "Is she the one Martin stayed with while the baby situation was being resolved?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  But it seems likely.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about this?"}, {"instruction": "You mean how do I feel now that I don't think Martin cheated on me?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "I guess it's nice.  I'm glad and somewhat relieved.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But ultimately it doesn't change anything.", "input": "", "output": "Have you had any sexual relations with Martin recently?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean by recently?", "input": "", "output": "In the past few months."}, {"instruction": "Well, sort of.", "input": "", "output": "You sort of had sex with Martin?"}, {"instruction": "When he came to me and told me about the baby being okay and all...well, it sort of happened then.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But there wasn't any vaginal penetration, if that's what you're asking.", "input": "", "output": "No, I meant it more generally than that."}, {"instruction": "Then I guess so.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  We're out of time, Anna.  I'll see you next week.  I would recommend trying to make living arrangements..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Call..."}, {"instruction": "I'll call if I need you.  Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  Good night, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "How's work?"}, {"instruction": "It's good, as far as the project is concerned.  We're basically done and don't have much to do.  They'll be making the grand announcement sometime next week, I think.  There still might be some problems with the code in some very obscure circumstances, but I think it's pretty sound at this point. We'll see.", "input": "", "output": "That's good.  So I guess you're no longer living in the programmers' lounge."}, {"instruction": "No.  And after I took David to the S&M club, it wasn't a good idea any more.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "David is the \"kiss and tell\" type.  I think he was on the phone spreading the word about my alternative lifestyle minutes after he got home that night.  Now, I'm the local expert on whipping and pleasure through pain and body mutilation.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And it's not like I'm the only one at SII that's doing it.  I bet there are quite a few S&Mers working there, and I don't even count Martin. And I have far fewer artificial body holes then some of the other people in my department, David included.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "I just have pierced ears, and that was my mom's idea.", "input": "", "output": "Ah."}, {"instruction": "David has three holes in one ear alone.  And god only knows what  and where some of the other places might be.", "input": "", "output": "So your whole department knows that you belong to an S&M club?"}, {"instruction": "They do now.", "input": "", "output": "I thought that you told some of your friends before..."}, {"instruction": "No.  Caren and Greg knew.  The others just thought that Martin was weird.  I don't think I'll be able to spend another night on that couch.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Julian came to talk to me about safe sex.  And what does he know about it?  He's been married for almost ten years.", "input": "", "output": "What did he talk to you about?"}, {"instruction": "He told me that he thought it wasn't for me.  He said that I'm not the type of girl that should be involved with that \"I tie you up and have my way with you\" sex stuff.  But the only thing he knows about S&M is what he saw in some porno movie once.  He has no idea.  But he felt it his duty to try and warn me off it.  David is such an idiot.  I really thought he knew better.  Now I'm going to have people ask me stupid questions for years.", "input": "", "output": "Does it make you uncomfortable?"}, {"instruction": "Well, as I said, I won't be staying there overnight for some time.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It will pass, but really...", "input": "", "output": "How's your home life?"}, {"instruction": "I think Martin and Kathy know that I won't be around for much longer.", "input": "", "output": "Have you told them anything?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.  But I've been avoiding them both, and they both tried to talk to me.", "input": "", "output": "What did they want?"}, {"instruction": "Martin told me that he never felt about a person the way he feels about me.  I guess he was trying to tell me he loved me, but he never quite said it.  He said that he feels like I'm trying to separate myself emotionally from him.  What was his first clue?", "input": "", "output": "Was he trying to talk you into staying with him?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  It felt more like goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And what about Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "She was a lot more freaked out about losing me.  In a way, I sort of wish that Martin was reacting the way she is.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Two months ago, we were talking about getting married.  And now, the guy hardly seems upset that he might be losing me forever.  It's very strange.  I feel like I have more remorse about this relationship ending than he does.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that you were more emotionally involved in the relationship than Martin was?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I was.  Maybe this is all the aftershock of Kathy's baby thing.  But I almost feel like Martin would be relieved to see me go.", "input": "", "output": "Will Martin stay with Kathy after you're gone?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't ask.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "It's not my responsibility to make sure that Kathy's happy.", "input": "", "output": "Is Kathy asking you for something?"}, {"instruction": "She said that she would do anything if I stayed.  And...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I almost got a feeling that she was going to threaten me with hurting herself.", "input": "", "output": "Did she say something to you?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.  But I felt like our conversation was quickly going in that direction, so I ran out on her.", "input": "", "output": "Did she try to approach you again?"}, {"instruction": "I'm trying not give her the opportunity.  She apparently doesn't want to talk to me in front of Martin.  So as long as I maneuver myself right, I can stay out of trouble, although she did try to come to me in the middle of the night.", "input": "", "output": "What happened then?"}, {"instruction": "Well, our sleeping arrangements are that I sleep in the bedroom that Martin and I used to occupy, Kathy sleeps in the other bedroom, and Martin gets the couch.  When Kathy came into my bed to talk, I insisted on going to the bathroom first--nature called.  I made tons of noise and made sure that Martin was up for the discussion.  Kathy chickened out.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Are you still planning on moving out next week?"}, {"instruction": "I'm planning.", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to?"}, {"instruction": "My dad said that he knows someone in the city with an unused in-law unit.  He's coming up this weekend to introduce me and show me the place.  So it might happen.  And I'll be going on a company vacation in a week or so.", "input": "", "output": "So you talked to your parents about moving out?"}, {"instruction": "They think that it's all their idea--that by using their powers of persuasion, they've managed to save their daughter from a monstrous situation.  They are very happy.", "input": "", "output": "And how do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I still don't know.  I think I do better when I'm in a relationship or at least when there's a possibility of a relationship. Right now, when I think about it, I just get this horrible empty feeling inside.  It makes me almost nauseous.  But, at the same time, when I think of what could have been...I don't know.  It's a no win situation.  I will miss Martin.  And in some sick way, I'll miss Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "I realized that I've been relying on Kathy for conversation for almost a year.  I used to tell her all the stuff that I couldn't share with anyone else.  There was nothing that was going to shock her, and she made everything--no matter how outlandish--seem within the norm.", "input": "", "output": "I can see how that would be valuable.  But Kathy stopped being your confidant quite some time ago, right?"}, {"instruction": "But I miss that.", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  But you stopped sharing your life with Kathy about the time you felt you were competing with her for Martin's attention."}, {"instruction": "It was never really a competition.  If she didn't get pregnant...", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Kathy felt like she was competing with you?"}, {"instruction": "I guess she did.  Well, she got him now.  He's all hers.  I hope she's happy.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Martin and Kathy will stay together after you leave?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy doesn't have a job.  Where is she going to go, back to her grandmother's?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know."}, {"instruction": "Well, as much as Martin liked to lick my feet, it was Kathy's job to do the mistress thing with him.  I wasn't too into it, remember?", "input": "", "output": "So you think they'll stay together?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe that's what she wants to talk to me about.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe."}, {"instruction": "But I don't know if I want to know and be that involved.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's like if I find out, it would be my responsibility.

Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What happened to you last week?"}, {"instruction": "Why?", "input": "", "output": "You weren't here."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I thought I called you.  We went on that company vacation I told you about.  Remember?", "input": "", "output": "You told me about it, but you never said when you were going."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry. I can clearly remember...with everything, I'm amazed that I'm as together as I seem.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Well, shall we start?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Your four week deadline is up; have you moved?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "That's great, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I'll write down my new address for you before I go.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  And how did it go?"}, {"instruction": "Well Friday, the day after our last session, my dad called and told me that a friend of his, a professor at UCSF, is going to Europe for a semester.  He was looking for someone to housesit for him.  They don't want to rent the house out because they are worried about San Francisco rent control laws and stuff, and his wife feels funny about letting strangers sleep on their bed--they don't want to pack up all their stuff.  I can understand that. So my dad told them that I was looking for a place, and here I am.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good break."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's a bit more bizarre than it seems, though.", "input": "", "output": "How's that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my dad came up that weekend and took me over to meet them. And guess what?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "The mild-mannered professor and his nice nice housewife belong to my S&M club.  Of course, it was a bit hard to recognize him at first, since I've only seen the guy naked with a leather collar and cuffs.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "It was very charming.  My dad didn't know a thing while his friend was just squirming.  It was a scene.", "input": "", "output": "I can only imagine."}, {"instruction": "But they were very nice to me, very nice. I basically get to live in this huge Victorian in lower Pacific Heights rent free.  I have to pay for the utilities and that's all.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a great deal."}, {"instruction": "It gets even better.  I get full use of their dungeon!", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Their in-law unit has been completely transformed into this nicely outfitted dungeon. And now it's all mine.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Does your father..."}, {"instruction": "He doesn't suspect a thing.  The rest of the house is as vanilla as it could get.  And Professor Zutkin was so freaked when he recognized me. You should have seen him--his hands were shaking and his face was all the colors of the rainbow.  When his wife took my dad out to check out the garden in the back, he expressed great concern that someone from the university community might find out about his alternative lifestyle.  I told him that he had nothing to worry about from me and that my dad doesn't suspect a thing.  If he did, he would never have taken me there. He was so happy that he let me have the place basically for free.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I'm not allowed to throw any S&M parties there, although I can have a guest or two for play, if you know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "I do.  But I was hoping that once you move away from Martin and Kathy, you'd stop with these experimentations."}, {"instruction": "I know you were hoping that.  But I told you before, I like it.  And I like it despite everything that happened with Martin and Kathy. I'm not saying that I'll get all fanatical about it.  I'm not going to change my lifestyle to accommodate the full range of my secret desires.  But having my personal dungeon is very nice.  You can come and visit sometime.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, I think I'll pass."}, {"instruction": "As you like. But it has some very nice toys.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure. So tell me more about the move. How did Kathy and Martin take it?"}, {"instruction": "I guess as you would expect.  Martin acted as though he knew it all the time.  He helped me pack and move my things over to the house.  It was all very friendly.  Friendly and cold at the same time. It was as if we were just roommates and nothing more. I was very happy that Caren and Greg showed up to help me move and I didn't have to deal with Martin all alone.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "If I was given a chance, I feel like I would have gone off and done something very emotional and ultimately stupid.  This way, it was all very civilized.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think you would have done?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  Something stupid.  I don't want to talk about that, Doctor.  I feel if I get into this, I'll just make myself live through this imaginary nightmare that I so neatly avoided in real life.  So let's move on.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  Tell me about Kathy."}, {"instruction": "Well, that wasn't as clean as Martin.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what her trip is.  She was more than just upset when I made my announcement.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the last few weeks, she's been all edgy and jumpy.  She kept trying to talk to me, and I kept avoiding her.  Then my dad came and took me away for all of Saturday.  And in the evening, we drove to Davis for Easter and Sunday Brunch. Happy Easter, by the way.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. Happy Easter to you."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. I rented a car for the week and left for Calistoga directly from my parents' house.", "input": "", "output": "That's the company get away?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. It was very nice, but a story in itself.", "input": "", "output": "I would like to hear about it."}, {"instruction": "Sure, I'll be happy to tell you all about it. But let me finish up with Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Sorry, go ahead."}, {"instruction": "This Monday, I drove directly to work. So I wasn't home for over a week.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Monday night, I made my announcement, packed, and got ready to move first thing Tuesday--I wanted to use my rental car to help me move. In any case, Kathy didn't get any opportunity to confront me. After I told them that I was moving out, Kathy just sort of curled up in a ball in the corner by the window.  She was sitting in the same position completely catatonic when I said my goodbyes and left the following morning.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure it's not the last I'm going to hear from her.

You even said that Julian came to have a little talk with you."}, {"instruction": "Yes, he did. Well, everyone in the department just wanted to know more about this whole S&M thing: \"How does it feel? Does it really hurt? Can you have an orgasm that way? Is it fun?\" Just millions of questions.  So every night, we would get together after dinner, and the whole department would sit in the hot tub and talk S&M. It was very strange but fun. I was the complete center of attention. I was their expert on this subject--that was nice for a change. And, best of all, I was basically the only female there.", "input": "", "output": "You were?"}, {"instruction": "I'm the only female in our programming group.  The only married person is Julian, and he brought his wife with him so he couldn't really lounge with us at night. But I had a blast.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And just to make it completely democratic, I left my bathing suit at home.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "You've seen my breasts, Doctor.  They're pretty nice, don't you think? Do you want to take another look?", "input": "", "output": "No, you're right.

I was really sore, wasn't I?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "But no.  This time no one has touched by butt, with a whip or with a paddle, in quite some time.

It's nice to be worried over sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "So how is the new place working out for you?"}, {"instruction": "It's quite nice.  Lot's of room.

And there are tons of things like that.  I had to get rid off all the stupid junk that Eleanor--the Professor's wife--spreads out in their bathroom.

I moved one chair in the bedroom closer to the window so I can read in a natural light and just generally be more comfortable.  But there is this large square area on the carpet where the chair used to be, and it's making me unhappy.  Stupid, right?  So each time I finish reading, I move the chair back to it's normal position.  And it's like that with everything.  It's just not my home.  It doesn't feel mine.", "input": "", "output": "It's true that a house and its contents reflect the personality of its owners.

Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "For what?"}, {"instruction": "For giving me permission, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  So how was the rest of your week?"}, {"instruction": "Somehow I feel so alone. Remember I told you how I used to talk to Bill in my head after we broke up?", "input": "", "output": "You said that you had continuous imaginary conversations with him where he was telling you just how sorry he was that you were gone."}, {"instruction": "Well, it wasn't all about that.", "input": "", "output": "Are you having the same type of conversations with Martin?"}, {"instruction": "No. I had those conversations while I still lived in the apartment.  I guess I said all I had to say to him and I no longer need to keep that connection going.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I find myself talking to Kathy a lot.  The first time it happened, the first time I caught myself doing it, I just freaked out.  Why would I want to talk to her?  She made my life so miserable.

I think this might be your way of putting closure on that relationship."}, {"instruction": "Maybe.", "input": "", "output": "What is the tone of these conversations?"}, {"instruction": "Tone?", "input": "", "output": "Are you confronting her? Are you trying to explain to her your feelings?"}, {"instruction": "I guess it might be a bit of both.  There was a point when I relied on her for support.  I looked up to her, and I learned from her.  And I never really realized the emptiness that was created when we became competitors for Martin's affections.  Well, emptiness might not be the right word.  I had so many emotions and feelings surging through me at the same time then--emptiness is just not the right description.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "It's like I couldn't unload my feelings somehow. I talked with Martin about how I felt, and I had conversations with Caren and Greg.  But that didn't feel like I was letting go.  It was always very well edited and filtered to fit my audience, and it never resulted in the emotional release I guess I was seeking from those interactions.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't really know what I'm talking about, Doctor.  I'm just making it up as I go along.  I never really analyzed all of this.", "input": "", "output": "You're doing fine.  It sounds like you miss having a good friend."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I feel like I have multiple personalities.  Everyone gets a certain facet of me, but no one really knows the totality.  God, it sounds too pretensious, don't you think?  I'm beginning to feel too full of myself.  Let's just stop now, Doctor, before I run away with myself.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "I thought you were doing very well."}, {"instruction": "Well, as long as you are happy, Doctor. But seriously, I've got to get going.  I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  Our time is just about up anyway.  Have a good week, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "You look tired.  Have you been getting enough sleep lately?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I haven't been sleeping well, actually.", "input": "", "output": "Do you still feel uncomfortable in the new house?"}, {"instruction": "I guess it's better now.  I did what you suggested and invited my parents over for the weekend.  It was the first time they've stayed over at my place--well, the Professor's place--since I moved away from home.", "input": "", "output": "And how was that?"}, {"instruction": "It was nice.  They drove up Saturday afternoon, and I made an early dinner for them.  Sunday, they took me out for brunch.  It was all very nice.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk about Martin and Kathy at all?"}, {"instruction": "A bit.", "input": "", "output": "And?  I feel like I'm pulling teeth with you today, Anna.  Are you not in a mood to talk or is there something bothering you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, Doctor.  I'll try to be more cooperative.  Let's see.  My mother really wanted to know how I was feeling. And I mean she really wanted to know.  So every time my dad stepped out of the room, she rushed over to me and started probing: \"How do I feel? Have I spoken to anyone recently? Am I seeing anyone yet?\"  It's only been a few weeks.  What is she expecting?  A knight in shining armor?  That would be a miracle.  Maybe she wants me to get back together with Martin.", "input": "", "output": "You sound resentful."}, {"instruction": "I guess I am a bit.  By the time she was my age, my mom was married already.  But that was then.  People don't even start looking for a life-partner until they're in their thirties now.", "input": "", "output": "You considered marrying Martin."}, {"instruction": "And look where that landed me.  I'm living alone in a giant house which isn't mine, full of furniture and stuff lurking in the corners which doesn't leave me alone.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You know that chair you told me to move?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Well, I did move it and I didn't move it back.  But that piece of clean carpet is screaming at me, Doctor.  I cringe every time I even think of that stupid patch of wool.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "But don't worry, Doctor. I'm determined not to move that chair back.  I'm doing everything in my power to get that part of the carpet as dirty as the rest of the house.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Wouldn't it be easier to clean the whole carpet instead?"}, {"instruction": "Perhaps.  But it wouldn't be as much fun.  Now, I deliberately wear dirty shoes in the house.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But frankly, I just hadn't thought of your clean solution.", "input": "", "output": "How about the cutlery?"}, {"instruction": "I'm using mine now.  And it's better.  But I had to spend a lot of time drawing charts documenting the original location of all those stupid utensils.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  But now it's done, and you don't have to think about it again, right?"}, {"instruction": "I guess. Except that when my parents came to dinner and my mom wanted to help me cook, she couldn't find anything.  She is used to where everything used to be--they went over to that house for dinner a few times before.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me more about your mom."}, {"instruction": "She is fine.  She is very sweet, in fact.  It's just that she had these expectations of how my life will unfold, and it's not working out that way.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think she is disappointed?"}, {"instruction": "I know she is.  A lot of her friends have become grandmothers now, and she wants to be one, too.  But she doesn't want me to be unhappy and in some relationship just to get a grandchild.  She is just a worrier.  But my dad was great and ran interference for me a whole bunch of times while they were there.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel pressured by your mother to be in a relationship?"}, {"instruction": "Pressured is not exactly right.  I just know that she wants me to be with someone...to find someone that I can be happy with.  And I want that, too.  But I haven't encountered any prospects yet, except maybe...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "You know how I've always felt about you.", "input": "", "output": "Don't even go there, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I know.", "input": "", "output": "How's work?"}, {"instruction": "Smooth transition, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Anything interesting going on?"}, {"instruction": "I think quite the opposite.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when our programming team was first chosen for the millennium bug project, it was great.  We got all sorts of perks during and after.  I'm even looking at getting a huge bonus this quarter.", "input": "", "output": "So what's the problem?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the problem is that I'm part of the millennium bug team.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not following you."}, {"instruction": "Well, now the SII Mole has been released.  There has been a lot of good publicity, and people seem to like it.  I have to say that I feel a little like a proud mom when it comes to the Mole.  We have little cartoons of the Mole character that we designed all over our cubicles.  It's kind of cute.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "The Marketing Department doesn't seem to like it as much as we do, though--something about it being a bit oversexed.  But Lloyd, I'm told, likes it just fine.  He has one hanging in his office.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  But what does this have to do with your obvious feeling of unhappiness regarding your job?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that was fun.  But now every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants a customized version of SII Mole for their organization.", "input": "", "output": "Big demand?"}, {"instruction": "You can definitely say that.  And since I was on the original team, I get the privilege of being on the Mole customization team. At this rate, I'll be doing Moles until I turn eighty.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'll get paid well, but I don't stand a chance of doing anything fun ever again.", "input": "", "output": "I guess everything has it's downside."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.

So I invited them to come and see.  We got together last Tuesday evening and had a party.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't a real S&M party--none of them really had a clue about that. So I don't feel like I have violated the Professor's covenants or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Of course not."}, {"instruction": "No, really.  It was more like a field trip into a S&M culture.  I got dressed up in my little leather outfit and demonstrated the many toys Professor and Eleanor are into.  It was a ball.  David was very funny.  He felt that since he had actually been to one of these things before, he got to act as my assistant.  He even tried to dress the part.  He wore these leather pants and jacket, and a pair of cowboy's boots.  No shirt.  When I saw him, I just had to laugh.  But he tried.  It wasn't close, but he tried.", "input": "", "output": "Did your co-workers enjoy the field trip?"}, {"instruction": "Very much.  I showed off the shoes that Martin gave me.  I'm sure they'd seen stuff like that before, but probably never on a real live person.  And I did a paddling demonstration--David volunteered.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "That was my favorite part.  That boy deserves a beating.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "No.  We ordered pizza and watched a movie I rented.", "input": "", "output": "What movie?"}, {"instruction": "It was sort of an S&M tutorial.  I picked it up at the store.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy's store?"}, {"instruction": "She no longer works there.", "input": "", "output": "How did it feel to go back there?"}, {"instruction": "Strange.  I half expected to see Kathy there.", "input": "", "output": "Did you want to see her?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  But she wasn't there.  There was some idiot running the store.

Well, I better be going then.  I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "All right, I'll see then.  Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.

What are your symptoms?"}, {"instruction": "So far, only cramping in my stomach.

Kathy said that she was very vulnerable after the abortion.  She said that she kept having these terrible recurring nightmares.  And Martin wouldn't have anything to do with her.  She told me how she kept trying to get his support.  But when she told him about her nightmare seeing the cut up baby in the wastebasket, he just walked out for three whole days.  Finally, she said that she just couldn't take it anymore.  He never even called to find out what happened to her.", "input": "", "output": "Does Martin know that Kathy's with you?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy left him a long message explaining why she left and how he could get in touch with her if he needed to.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "The nightmares are really bad.  She wakes up screaming two or three times a night.  And when I come by to see her, she's all white and trembly and totally wet.", "input": "", "output": "The nightmare is the cut-up baby in the wastebasket?"}, {"instruction": "She was pretty far along, and she did see the fetus on the ultrasound or something.  So she has a very clear image of what the baby looked like.  And she said that she was once assaulted by this anti-abortion activist woman who kept shoving pictures of cut up fetuses who must have been still alive when they were shredded to bits like that.  Kathy said that she was never able to get those pictures out of her mind. And after she had the abortion herself, the baby on that picture transformed into her own.  It's really so horrible, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "Did she ever tell you why she had the abortion?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, no, not really.  But I just don't feel right to press her on that issue right now.", "input": "", "output": "So Martin is not very sympathetic to Kathy's torment over the lost baby."}, {"instruction": "He is not at all.  Kathy said that he forbid her to talk to him about it. She was never to mention anything relating to the baby, or the pregnancy, or the abortion.", "input": "", "output": "As I remember, Martin was really upset when Kathy chose to discontinue the pregnancy, especially since the baby was all right and was shown not to have Down's syndrome."}, {"instruction": "Yes, that's true.  And I was upset as well, although I believe that Kathy ultimately did the right thing.  I don't think that baby would have had a happy life given the situation. And Kathy had the right to chose what she wanted to do.  It's her body.", "input": "", "output": "Let's drop the abortion issue for the moment.  Tell me what are you planning to do regarding Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Let me be more explicit.  Kathy has no job, no money, and no place that she wants to stay other than yours. Right?"}, {"instruction": "Look, Doctor.  Kathy was my friend.  We had a terrible falling out.  But now she has come to me for help.  I don't want her living with me.  But I can't just throw her out, can I now?", "input": "", "output": "She is not your responsibility, Anna."}, {"instruction": "And I'm not planning to make her my responsibility, Doctor.

I'm glad you realize that.

And frankly, I wasn't feeling up to it either.", "input": "", "output": "I thought this stomach thing was only supposed to last twelve hours?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it didn't. I really came down with it on Friday.  I got all the symptoms.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that."}, {"instruction": "Yes, well...", "input": "", "output": "And Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "She did a good job of taking care of me.  I had to stay home, of course.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I did feel better by Saturday, but I was definitely in no shape to do something assertive.", "input": "", "output": "You mean like telling Kathy to leave?"}, {"instruction": "No, I meant exertion.  You know, going out, looking for a place.", "input": "", "output": "You said assertive, which is really more to the point, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "Let's not play word games.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  How's Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "Her stomach started to hurt on Saturday, but she didn't really get all the symptoms.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And is she better now?"}, {"instruction": "She's okay, just a bit tired perhaps. And I believe her.  She has been through a lot, you know.", "input": "", "output": "Are you planning on looking for an apartment this weekend?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  And just because we were home doesn't mean we weren't looking.  I surf the web every day.  We have a lot of leads.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you are actively working on finding Kathy a place to live."}, {"instruction": "She has been very nice, Doctor.  She even offered to pay part of my rent.  But since I don't really pay anything but utilities, I thought that would be silly.  She's not using up that much electricity.  And she needs the money.", "input": "", "output": "Is she looking for work?"}, {"instruction": "We thought it might be a good idea to try to get her old job at the bookstore back.", "input": "", "output": "We?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy thought it was a good idea to try...", "input": "", "output": "I'm worried that you might be over attentive to her needs, Anna.  Are you really comfortable being in the position of Kathy's benefactor?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't thought of it that way. But since Martin faded out of view, we seem to get along great.  I'm not forgetting what she did to me; I'm just not thinking about it for the moment.  And doesn't helping Kathy out now make me a better person?", "input": "", "output": "Does it?"}, {"instruction": "I feel very good...superior about it, somehow. She has nothing: no job, no place to live, no family to turn to.  I'm swimming in dough...yes, I did get my bonus and it was very nice, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Congratulations."}, {"instruction": "And I have a great place to live.  And I have a very good relationship with my family.  Except for my love life, I'm \"King of the world.\"", "input": "", "output": "Titanic?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I loved that movie, cried all three times.", "input": "", "output": "You saw it three times?"}, {"instruction": "I guess that makes me a fan, although not a lunatic.  I've heard about this woman in Australia that saw the movie a thousand...", "input": "", "output": "We are getting off the subject."}, {"instruction": "The last time, I took Kathy to see it.  It was her first time.  She thought she'd hate it, but she loved it.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I would like to talk about your newfound relationship with Kathy. Why do you think you're enjoying her company so much?"}, {"instruction": "Why not? We have nothing to compete for now.", "input": "", "output": "You said that you feel superior to Kathy."}, {"instruction": "It's not necessarily superior to Kathy.  It's more like I'm in a superior position.", "input": "", "output": "Like when you just had Kathy move in with you and Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I was in a superior position then, too.  So what? It didn't work out anyway.", "input": "", "output": "But it started to fall apart when Kathy was beginning to get more and more of Martin's attentions.  And it really broke down when Kathy got pregnant with Martin's child."}, {"instruction": "Are you saying that she was on top then?", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "Martin still wanted to marry me.  And what about before Martin moved to San Francisco?", "input": "", "output": "How did your relationship with Kathy feel then?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she was the S&M expert.  I came to her for advice.", "input": "", "output": "But did you feel like Kathy was superior to you in some way?"}, {"instruction": "She knew more about S&M and her life had this sense of tragedy and mystery somehow.  It was a bit seedy.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like you felt you had a better life than she did."}, {"instruction": "That's clearly true.  I won't deny that.  But I'm not sure it was a superior life, just happier and more rewarding.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel Kathy was envious of you?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  She even said that.", "input": "", "output": "What did she say?"}, {"instruction": "She often said that she wished she had my brains and even my looks, although I think Kathy is very pretty in her own right.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you are smarter?"}, {"instruction": "I had more opportunities to learn and I've had a better education.", "input": "", "output": "Are you smarter?  Don't be afraid to admit it, there is nothing wrong with that."}, {"instruction": "I guess I am.", "input": "", "output": "When Martin was splitting his attentions between you and Kathy, did you feel like you were being compared to her? Unfavorably, maybe?"}, {"instruction": "I...", "input": "", "output": "Did you feel like her being there lowered your sense of self-worth somehow?"}, {"instruction": "Martin and I were clearly a better match.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "We just were.  We both came from good families and had very good educations and great jobs.  Doctor, what are trying to make me say?  That I'm interested in Kathy because she makes me feel good about myself in some sick and perverted way?", "input": "", "output": "You said that you have so much and she has nothing."}, {"instruction": "Look, if I wanted to...never mind.", "input": "", "output": "What is it?"}, {"instruction": "I know that Kathy is manipulative and jealous of me. But...", "input": "", "output": "You like her attentions?"}, {"instruction": "It's just for a little bit.  I have nothing better to do with my time at the moment.  I can help her.  I owe her.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "If it wasn't for her, I might have ended up marrying Martin.  And now I realize that would have been a terrible mistake.  She saved me.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I believe that if weren't for Kathy, you would never even have considered marrying Martin."}, {"instruction": "Are you saying I was doing it because I wanted to win?", "input": "", "output": "That's a good way of putting it.  You didn't want to lose Martin to Kathy.  Somehow, it was very important to you that Martin considered you the better of the two."}, {"instruction": "You know, I was very proud for being the one to leave Martin.", "input": "", "output": "I'm proud of you, too."}, {"instruction": "But the way you're putting it, it was still Martin who abandoned me.  I don't like that.", "input": "", "output": "I know."}, {"instruction": "Bill left me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Next time, I'll be in control of the relationship.", "input": "", "output": "Like you are in control of your relationship with Kathy now?"}, {"instruction": "I guess.  What do you want of me?", "input": "", "output": "I just want you to see that your present involvement with Kathy is based on your feelings of insecurity and inadequacy."}, {"instruction": "But you just made me admit that I was better than she was?", "input": "", "output": "I think you are.  But you are using her to prove this to yourself.  This is not a healthy thing for either of you.  You have to let go, Anna.  Move on.  You have your own life to lead, she has hers.  If it weren't for Martin, do you think you two would have been friends?"}, {"instruction": "I guess we would have never even met.  But I think I benefited from this relationship in some way.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I...in some sick way, I'm a lot more popular at work.", "input": "", "output": "And do you like that?"}, {"instruction": "I guess.  They might not really be true, but the rumors of my sex life give me a sense of the exotic, I guess.  I'm no longer as nerdy as I was before.", "input": "", "output": "Is that the reputation you want?"}, {"instruction": "It's okay for now.  It has its moments.  I don't think I lost any of my \"goody-two-shoes\" mystique.  I just gained a little S&M thing on top.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Look, Doctor, we must be out of time.  It just flies when we're having fun, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "All right.  It is getting late.  I'll see you in a week.  And please think about what we talked about today.  I don't want you to get stuck in a relationship you don't really want."}, {"instruction": "I won't.  It's just for bit.  I'll find her a place to live by next time, I promise.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "No, it's all right.  I just have very bad cramps.", "input": "", "output": "Did you take anything for pain?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  Motrin--don't leave home without it!", "input": "", "output": "Are you up to having a session?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I will be.  Just let me get comfortable.  In about ten minutes, the Motrin should kick in.", "input": "", "output": "All right, whenever you are ready."}, {"instruction": "I'm ready, just ignore the grimaces of pain.", "input": "", "output": "I'll try."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  I'll start with a biggie.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy has moved out?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Don't tell me she is still living with you.  You promised me last time that..."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know.  It will happen, Doctor.  I'm not dragging my feet.  It's just very hard to find a place to live in San Francisco right now, especially on a very tight budget.", "input": "", "output": "Did Kathy get a job?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, we are getting off the subject.", "input": "", "output": "Are we?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I told you I have a biggie for you today.", "input": "", "output": "All right, what is it?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't Martin's.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "The baby, it wasn't Martin's.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy got pregnant by someone other than Martin?  How did you find that out?"}, {"instruction": "One night, we just sort of got to talking about all of that, and I asked her why she did it--why she got an abortion.", "input": "", "output": "And she just came out and told you?"}, {"instruction": "More or less.  We've been talking for a while; I guess she felt safe enough to tell me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Well, whose was it?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure exactly.  I know it's someone from the community.", "input": "", "output": "From your S&M club?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Kathy said that she's been playing with this guy for a long time, years maybe.  But after we all got together last summer, she felt it wouldn't be right to actually have sex with him any more, and so they restricted their playing to just...you know.", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  So Kathy didn't want to cheat on you and Martin, but she still felt comfortable enough to do the..."}, {"instruction": "She said that as long as there wasn't any penetration, she felt it was okay.", "input": "", "output": "It's an interesting take on monogamy, or polygamy, actually."}, {"instruction": "I don't particularly subscribe to it, but that sort of thinking is common.  Most even find that it's okay to go further than that, with permission from everyone concerned of course.", "input": "", "output": "Of course."}, {"instruction": "I told Martin that I didn't like that.  We never really played with anyone but each other and Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, there were a few times, but...never mind.  It's not important now.  In any case, I've never felt that Kathy should be obliged to do the same.  I've always thought of her as sort of one nudge outside of our relationship.  I didn't want her to get AIDS, but other than that, she was free to pursue other interests.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And did Martin feel the same way?"}, {"instruction": "I assume so.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So Kathy continued her relationship with this guy, even though she was involved with us.", "input": "", "output": "What was her relationship with this guy?  Was she the top?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Kathy said that this guy is very powerful.  He is always in control, and it's very hard to say no to him.  Kathy said that sometimes she didn't feel like she could have ended the relationship even if she wanted to.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  And you don't know who this guy is, right?"}, {"instruction": "No, I told you I don't.  Kathy said I've never met him.  So this one night, around Thanksgiving...do you remember how ugly it was then?", "input": "", "output": "I do.  You wanted Martin to go to your parents' house, and Kathy wanted him to stay home with her.  I remember.  But Kathy won, didn't she?  Martin stayed with her instead of going with you."}, {"instruction": "Yes, well.  Kathy said that she was feeling very vulnerable then.  A few days after Thanksgiving when Martin and I worked late, she went down to the club and this guy was there.  He took her to his place, and she said that they had a very intense session.  But afterwards, he wouldn't let her leave.  She said that she kept saying that she needed to go and was tired, but he kept pressing her.  She said that she couldn't say no to him.  He fucked her in the face.  Kathy said it was completely terrifying, but at the same time, she said that she lost all control.  She said that she kept having one orgasm after another.  Finally, he just did the other thing, too.", "input": "", "output": "They had intercourse?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Kathy said that it wasn't her idea.  It just happened.  She said that she has been trying to avoid him ever since.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So Kathy thought that the baby was his?"}, {"instruction": "She said that at first, it didn't even occur to her.  But the dates matched.  She said that she went on this campaign to fuck Martin as often as she could, which didn't improve our relations any.", "input": "", "output": "No, it wouldn't have."}, {"instruction": "Kathy said that she kept hoping that the baby was Martin's.  Finally, she asked for the amino test. She found out Martin's blood type, and checked with the clinic if there was a chance that the baby was his.  I guess there wasn't.  She told us that the baby tested positive for Down's syndrome.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "She continued to pretend the baby was Martin's. She didn't know what else to do.  She said that she felt completely freaked.  And at that point, neither Martin nor I wanted to have anything to do with her.  She finally decided to just get rid of it.", "input": "", "output": "I assume that Martin thought the baby was his, and he probably wouldn't have checked on the baby's blood type. So why didn't Kathy just go on and..."}, {"instruction": "I asked the same thing.  But she said that we would have been able to tell--the father was a black man.  It would have been obvious that the baby wasn't Martin's after birth.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So she had the abortion pretending that the baby had Down's syndrome."}, {"instruction": "Right, and it would have worked, too, if Martin didn't look into her file.", "input": "", "output": "That's quite a story."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I can't even be mad at her now.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "She must have been so out of it.  Can you imagine what it must have been like for her?  I shudder just to think.", "input": "", "output": "So Martin knows nothing of this?  He is still mad at Kathy for getting rid of his baby?"}, {"instruction": "He knows nothing.  I won't tell, why should I?", "input": "", "output": "Did this slave master know about Kathy's pregnancy?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I don't think so.", "input": "", "output": "You said that Kathy was showing quite a bit at the end, and she was having public performances while pregnant of skin mutilations."}, {"instruction": "Branding.", "input": "", "output": "And he still didn't know?"}, {"instruction": "I guess not.  Kathy said that she didn't see him since that night.  Isn't this horrible?", "input": "", "output": "It's not good."}, {"instruction": "Kathy said that she still feels the guilt and remorse over the baby's death.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you told me about her nightmares."}, {"instruction": "She screams every night.  But there wasn't much else she could do.", "input": "", "output": "She could have told you and Martin the truth."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  She got raped--it was rape, you do realize that?  I told Kathy that, too.  But then what?", "input": "", "output": "How would you have felt about her and the pregnancy if you had known all the facts?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I would have been a lot less threatened by her.", "input": "", "output": "Would you have helped her?"}, {"instruction": "Probably.", "input": "", "output": "And Martin?"}, {"instruction": "He would have probably went and gotten himself killed trying to avenge Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  But he wouldn't have thrown her out on the street, right?"}, {"instruction": "No, of course not.  It wasn't her fault.", "input": "", "output": "So she should have told you the truth."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I think she knows that now.  But then, it was very difficult to see things clearly.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  Our time is just about up.  Are you still planning on having Kathy move out soon?"}, {"instruction": "As soon as we find her a place to live.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  The sooner, the better."}, {"instruction": "I know.  I'll see you next week, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  I'll see you then.  Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Well thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "So, how is it going?"}, {"instruction": "Life has its moments, although I seem to be getting my thrills through Kathy lately.", "input": "", "output": "You sound angry. What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, as you expected, Kathy is still living with me.  But it won't last long.  I'm getting very fed up.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  Kathy couldn't get her job at the bookstore back.  Apparently, she had a bad falling out with the owner, and now he doesn't want anything to do with her.  It's really stupid, because Kathy did add a lot of value to that place. She has the right expertise and disposition to run it, as opposed to the dodo who's there now.", "input": "", "output": "I remember you didn't like him."}, {"instruction": "He was fine, just clueless.  I bet he got the job by fucking the owner or something, but whatever.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, please move on."}, {"instruction": "It's also Kathy's fault.  There was no need to burn that bridge.  She liked that job and she desperately needs it at the moment, I might add.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know what happened?"}, {"instruction": "No, and Kathy refuses to talk about it.  So she did some very stupid shit.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "She did a couple of live S&M acts.  And now, she's talking about starting a dominatrix practice.  It's very dangerous.", "input": "", "output": "What is she talking about?"}, {"instruction": "She wants to be an alternative sex therapist, of sorts.  She said that's what she is really qualified to do and she has all the necessary accouterments.  She wants to set up a business where she'll be offering her services as an S&M top. She wants to be a dominatrix for money.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "No, it's worse than you think.  She wants to go around to people's houses, by herself, and beat them.", "input": "", "output": "Is sex going to be part of the services she offers to her clients?"}, {"instruction": "God!  No, I don't think so.  Kathy said that these people just want to be abused, not fucked.  And even though there's clearly a sexual component to this, she said that she's not interested in doing anything involving actual penetration.  Wait, that's not exactly right.  She said that she might do some body piercings, but most clients prefer not to have any tell-tale marks on their body after the encounter is over. That wouldn't be seemly for a VP of Bank of America, for instance.", "input": "", "output": "How does Kathy know so much about this business?"}, {"instruction": "Do you mean has she done this before?", "input": "", "output": "Has she?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm.  I think she might have.  She's not saying.  I think she might have worked in one of those prostitute house things...", "input": "", "output": "Brothels."}, {"instruction": "Brothels.  I think she might have been underage at the time, too.  But that's history.  But at least then, she wasn't doing it all alone.  There were people around who could have helped her if a customer went bezerk or something.  Now, she's talking about going to people's homes by herself.  She said, since she'll be the top, she won't have to worry about being attacked--that's not how it works.  But I think it's insane.  Anything can happen.  Kathy's a small woman.  And even brandishing a whip, she doesn't present a formidable target.  Things could easily get out of control.", "input": "", "output": "I think you're right.  What Kathy is talking about doing is very dangerous.  But remember, you are trying to disengage.  You are trying not to get involved in her life.  You are not her keeper.  You can advise her and tell her how you feel, but you can't stop her.  Right?"}, {"instruction": "I know.  She said that with the kind of money she'll be making, she'd be able to get a place to live and maybe even an education.  After all, it's an evening job, and she could easily take classes at City College in the mornings.  She keeps saying that she wouldn't do it for a long time.", "input": "", "output": "Doing something dangerous for a short time doesn't make it..."}, {"instruction": "No, but it does reduce the chances of something bad happening, Doctor.  But I still think it's a bad idea.  I think she should go back to her family and make good.  I bet they'd be thrilled to support her if she went back to school.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell Kathy that?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  And do you know what she wants?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "She wants me to do it with her!", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I won't do it, of course.  But she said that it would be a lot safer if we did it together.  I wouldn't have to do much, just keep an eye on things and make sure that everything and everyone is safe.  She wants me to be her safety net.", "input": "", "output": "Are you considering it?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I told you I won't do it.  But she's saying that she needs the money or she won't be able to pay the deposit and first and last month's rent for her own place.  It's like either I go with her into her dominatrix practice or she lives with me forever.  Can you believe that?  I got very mad at her.  She's putting me into a terrible position.  I told her that I would loan her the money she needs to move out, but she doesn't want to take it.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "She said that she would worry that she might not pay me back and some other bullshit stuff like that.  I told her that she could keep the money, I'd just give it to her as a gift.  But she won't take it--she doesn't want to feel that obligated to me.", "input": "", "output": "So Kathy refuses to take your money, but she's comfortable living at your place?"}, {"instruction": "And don't forget she's eating my food and a million other little things like gas, electricity, water, garbage, telephone, and all the other stupid stuff that she's using every day.", "input": "", "output": "I told you this would happen."}, {"instruction": "Don't even start, Doctor.  I know.  I remember.", "input": "", "output": "You're right.  That was uncalled for.  I'm sorry."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.  But the fact still remains: Kathy has no money to move out!  And get this, last Tuesday, when I came home from work, I noticed a man's jacket on a stool in the hallway.  I went through the house and didn't see anything else. And then about half an hour later, the door to the dungeon opens and this guy I've never seen comes out followed by Kathy in full attire.  She's been doing her little services in my dungeon!  I was ready to kill her.  I guess she didn't expect me home so early.  But she didn't even cringe when she saw me.  She just calmly ordered the guy to get out of the house.  He practically crawled out on his hands and knees.  He gave her two hundred bucks for her abusive services.", "input": "", "output": "And Kathy wasn't apologetic for using your house this way without your permission?"}, {"instruction": "She was after the guy left.  She said that she had to maintain her role while he was there.  We had a hell of a screaming fight after that.  I don't want to be involved in stuff like that.  No one is supposed to know about the dungeon thing.  She gave people my address!  I can just see when the professor comes back and some idiot bottom knocks on his door expecting a beating.  How can I ever explain that?  Or what if something went wrong and the police got involved.  God!  She's so stupid.  You just never do stuff like that at home.", "input": "", "output": "Has she done this more than once?"}, {"instruction": "She said that was her first time.  But who knows?  She might have been doing this all along.  I'm worried about leaving my house now, Doctor.  I can't believe her when she says that it won't happen again.", "input": "", "output": "What are you planning to do?"}, {"instruction": "I'm thinking of calling her Aunt Helen, although I don't really know what she can do.  She can't drag her out of my house kicking and screaming, can she?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think so.  But calling Helen might be a good idea.  Are you only worried about Kathy using the dungeon or is there something else?"}, {"instruction": "Do you mean like she might do damage to the house just to spite me or something?", "input": "", "output": "Would she do something like that?"}, {"instruction": "No.  That's not her style.  If anything, the house has been a lot cleaner and more orderly since she's been living there.  I don't think she'll do anything like that.  And I don't believe she'd steal anything.  But I can see her using the facilities to earn some money.  She could easily rationalize her actions by thinking she's working towards moving out of there.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy is not paying for anything while she's living with you, right?"}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "And you said that she did some live acts and now the dominatrix services.  It sounds like she might have some money.  Don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think she's doing drugs?"}, {"instruction": "She smokes pot.", "input": "", "output": "Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "I've never seen her do anything else.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't know?"}, {"instruction": "I guess not.", "input": "", "output": "I think you should ask Kathy how much money she has and insist on providing her with the difference that she needs to rent a place of her own."}, {"instruction": "I wonder how much money she does have.  It was two hundred dollars for an hour of her services.  I wonder...", "input": "", "output": "It's very hard to get rid of a person once they call your house their home.  I have to say I'm very worried, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, me too.  It's getting late, Doctor.  I'd better be going.  I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Call me if you need some help."}, {"instruction": "What are you going to do, Doctor?  Take her out for me?", "input": "", "output": "Just know that I'm available by telephone, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "I'm well. Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  How's Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "She's well.  We had an interesting discussion the other day.", "input": "", "output": "About what?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she noticed that I don't want her around anymore.", "input": "", "output": "What was her first clue?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "Sorry."}, {"instruction": "It was sort of pathetic, really.  She came to me in the middle of the night completely hysterical.  I thought she had one of her abortion nightmares.  But she said that she hasn't been sleeping well for several nights now worrying about our relationship.", "input": "", "output": "The relationship between you and her?"}, {"instruction": "She said that she could see everything crumbling around her.  She said that she feels like she is losing everything that is important to her in her life.  She told me that she \"feels it in her bones\" that once she moves out, we won't see each other any more.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Sounds like Kathy is finally picking up on some of your frustration with her."}, {"instruction": "I felt so guilty.  Of course it's true.  I was hoping never to see her again after she moves out.  I was only helping her and being \"her one true friend\" to get rid of her.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, she's playing on your emotions again."}, {"instruction": "She was genuinely upset, Doctor.  I don't think she was faking it.  She said that I was all she had, the only person willing to accept her for what she really is.  And I guess it's true.  I know who she is, she opened up to me.  I'm just not sure I really want to know.  But...", "input": "", "output": "I'm beginning to get worried, Anna.  What are you thinking?  Are you thinking of letting Kathy stay with you?"}, {"instruction": "No...I mean...only until she has enough money to leave, and we've been working on that.", "input": "", "output": "We?"}, {"instruction": "And you wouldn't believe the extent of her stupidity, Doctor.  It wasn't enough that she gave out my address.  I came home last week to twenty-seven messages on my answering machine.  Number nine was from my mother, she wants to come and visit again.  The rest of the messages ranged from heavy breathing and a click to full-on orders for Kathy's dominatrix services.", "input": "", "output": "She gave out your home phone number?"}, {"instruction": "She said that she didn't think she'd be so popular.  I guess her stage reputation has been great for marketing these new services.  She said she hoped that she would be able to get all the messages before I came home.  Needless to say, that was another screaming fight.  I was livid.  And I don't understand why all these people felt good leaving their messages after they'd heard my answering machine greeting: \"Hi.  How are you? This isn't me, but I'll listen later.  Leave it for me after the beep.\"  Does that sound like a \"I'll beat and abuse you for money\" answering service?", "input": "", "output": "No, but..."}, {"instruction": "Apparently, Kathy put an ad in the Bay Guardian with my number.  And she really thought she could get away with it without my knowing, or maybe she didn't even think at all.  She told me that she's been erasing all the messages for about a week now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you found out."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, me too.", "input": "", "output": "What are you going to do about it?"}, {"instruction": "I changed my number, of course.  I'll let all my friends know about the change via e-mail.", "input": "", "output": "Was the phone service listed to your name or is it the professor's number?"}, {"instruction": "No, it's mine.  All the other utilities are still in his name, but the phone we changed.  It seemed like it was a more personal service.  And thank God we did.", "input": "", "output": "So did you discuss the moving out arrangements with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "I told her that I wanted her to leave as soon as she was able.  She wouldn't take my money under any circumstances.  But I think she understood that we really can't live together anymore.  Although the night after that conversation, she had that hysterical outbreak.  I really feel sorry for her, Doctor.  She is not a horrible human being; she's more like a lost soul.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps.  But it's important that she moves out of your home.  If you want to continue a relationship with her after that, we can work on it then.  Now, you said something I didn't understand: \"we're working on it.\"  What's the \"we\" part?"}, {"instruction": "Oh.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, you're making me nervous."}, {"instruction": "It's not a big deal, Doctor.  Just relax.", "input": "", "output": "Now I'm very worried.  What's up?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy called me at work the other day.  She was out on a service call, and she felt that she didn't have a good grasp on her situation.", "input": "", "output": "A service call.  You mean she was acting as an out-call dominatrix?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she went to some hotel room.", "input": "", "output": "And what was the problem?"}, {"instruction": "She expected one client, but got a party of five.  So she was uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mean she got scared and called you for help?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And you told her no."}, {"instruction": "Of course.", "input": "", "output": "And then you went to help her anyway, right?"}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Anna.  What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, it wasn't bad.  We were in a hotel Downtown.  It had a nice view.  When I got there, Kathy was standing on a coffeetable, and the five guys were pretty much naked around her.  One was tied to a chair with his legs spread wide open--quite a view.  Two others were handcuffed together back to back.  One was standing next to a window with his hands tied to a curtain rod.  The other was licking her boots--he was the one who opened the door for me.  So Kathy had the situation pretty much under control.  I was there more as a security thing.  I didn't do anything.  I just got to stand there and watch.  Kathy's good at what she does.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "She never touched them...well, not with her hands anyway.  She sort of played with them with her paddle.  All of them had huge erections.  The guy who answered the door for me could have supported a few coats on his thing.", "input": "", "output": "Did you find that erotic?"}, {"instruction": "It was too unsettling for me at the time.  Later...well, it's been a long time since anything happened to me, Doctor.  I just had to help myself.  But at the time, no, it was more weird and scary than erotic, for me anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Did you do this again?"}, {"instruction": "No.  That was the only time I went with her.  But it wasn't as bad as I thought.  Being a dominatrix gives you a lot of control.  It was like an act.  And it wasn't anything more than what you'd see in a club.  It fact, only one of them had an orgasm, that I saw anyway.  That was sort of weird.  Kathy wasn't even dealing with him at the time.  He just came all over the window.  Somebody got quite a show.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I want you to promise me that you won't do this again.  This has the potential of getting very ugly and you might even get hurt.  Understand?  You can't do this.  And you've got to get Kathy out of your house.  I can see how she could make you..."}, {"instruction": "I'm not that malleable, Doctor.  If something happened to Kathy on that call and I'd refused to help her, I would have needed your services for the rest of my life.  How could have I lived with myself after that?", "input": "", "output": "That's why you need to get Kathy out of your house.  Kathy's walking a very dangerous tightrope.  She needs to figure out how to live her life without using you as her safety net."}, {"instruction": "I know.  I told her that she needs to find a real partner if she feels like she can't do this on her own.  But it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  It wasn't as closely related to prostitution as I thought.  It was more like a private party.  I can see how some of her clients might not want to join an S&M club and have to resort to services like Kathy's to get their ya-ya's out.", "input": "", "output": "It's still not your problem."}, {"instruction": "I know, Doctor.  And I'm working on getting Kathy out.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "How much money did she make at this party?"}, {"instruction": "Around four hundred bucks, I think.", "input": "", "output": "Doesn't she have enough money now?"}, {"instruction": "She said that she's looking.  I'll work on her this weekend.  And my mother wants to visit.  I certainly can't have Kathy living there if my parents come.  Kathy understands that.  She heard that message, too.", "input": "", "output": "Give her a date by which she has to move out.  Many people find having a goal or a deadline very inspirational."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  I'll do that.  Well, our time is up.  And as fun as this was, I've got to go home and check my messages now.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have your new number?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, here it is.  Kathy managed to transfer my old number to her name, and we installed another line--she says she needs the work.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  I'll see you next week, Anna.  Please, stay out of trouble."}, {"instruction": "I will.  See you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "She bought a car.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. Please sit down. What?"}, {"instruction": "The bitch bought a car.  A black Honda station wagon thing.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy bought a car?"}, {"instruction": "It sort of makes sense for her.  She has to carry this huge bag with all the props for her S&M services--chains, whips, ropes, handcuffs, lubricants...a dungeon in a suitcase.", "input": "", "output": "Hold on a second, Anna.  Are you telling me that you approve of this purchase?  Kathy was supposed to have used the money she was earning to move out of your house."}, {"instruction": "Well, she has all these clients, and it's not like they are conveniently located next to public transportation.", "input": "", "output": "It doesn't matter where her clients live.  That's her problem, not yours."}, {"instruction": "You're absolutely right, Doctor. And I let her have it, really.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So now Kathy doesn't have money to move out, right?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "You don't seem to be upset enough about this."}, {"instruction": "I was...I am.  But what am I supposed to do now?  She just came home last Sunday in this thing.  She was so happy.  It's her first car.  And it's nice.  She didn't go and get some stupid red sports thing; she was very sensible.  This is a car that even a Wells Fargo VP wouldn't be too freaked about having in his driveway.  It's totally forgettable. She really thought this through.", "input": "", "output": "How's that?"}, {"instruction": "She said that there was no way she would have been able to afford a car once she moved out of my house.", "input": "", "output": "So she made you subsidize her car purchase.  Great."}, {"instruction": "I guess that's one way of looking at it.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have another?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, don't be so disappointed in me, Doctor.  What am I supposed to do?  Make her give it back?  It's a done deal.  I just hope that now she can get it together to earn enough money to get a place to live soon.  She knows she owes me big.", "input": "", "output": "So you are just going to let this pass?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think I have much choice.  And Kathy told me that now that she has a car, she can do more sessions and...it's going to be all right.", "input": "", "output": "I hope so.  How about your parents' visit?"}, {"instruction": "They want to come down for the Fourth of July.", "input": "", "output": "Does that give Kathy enough time to move out?"}, {"instruction": "God.  I'll burn that bridge when I come to it, Doctor.  Can we talk about something else?", "input": "", "output": "Why?  What's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Martin has got a new girlfriend.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And does that bother you?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "It does.  You told me that now that he is out of your life, you are relieved and happy.  You said that you were happy that things didn't work out between the two of you. So why does his current love life bother you?  Why do you care?"}, {"instruction": "It's not so much that he's fucking someone else, Doctor.  I don't particularly care whose toes he sucks on.  It's the fact itself that bothers me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I follow."}, {"instruction": "It's been...what?  A couple of months?", "input": "", "output": "You moved out in January."}, {"instruction": "Six months.", "input": "", "output": "Are you unhappy that he didn't have a long enough grieving period after you left him?"}, {"instruction": "There's a little of that.  But mostly it's that I'm not seeing anyone.", "input": "", "output": "How is Martin's social life related to yours?"}, {"instruction": "Come on, Doctor. You know.", "input": "", "output": "Are you jealous of Martin?"}, {"instruction": "I just hate the fact that he managed to find someone and I didn't.  I'm far better looking than he is.  I'm more sociable.  I'm definitely nicer.  So what gives?  Why does he get to have someone to hold him at night and I get to sleep all alone?  I don't want to be alone, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You are not alone, unfortunately.  You have Kathy."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah.  And I have all these friends at work that I can hang out with.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "Most people my age are married or at least in a stable relationship.", "input": "", "output": "I don't believe that most twenty-seven year olds are in stable monogamous relationships. Give it time, Anna. It will happen to you, too."}, {"instruction": "I have been giving it time. I'm tired of giving it time.  All the men I meet have been psychotic in one way or another.  I'm not interested in sleeping around, and I'm not interested in casual dating, even though that has its thrills.  I want to be in love.  I function better when I'm in love.  With all the faults that my relationship with Martin had, I think I was a better person then.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, in many ways.  In a lot of small ways.  I slept better, for instance.  I ate better.  I worked better.", "input": "", "output": "Hold on, Anna.  Think back on how it actually was when you were living with Martin.  You had tons of problems.  It's not my recollection that you were eating and sleeping better.  As I remember, you were completely stressed out.  Because of the lapse of time, I think you are editing out the unpleasant memories and only recalling the good ones, however few they may have actually been."}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  But why can he find someone and I can't?  I heard her talking about just how much in love she was with him.  It's been only six months.", "input": "", "output": "You've met this woman?"}, {"instruction": "She is one of the secretaries or something at SII.  Her feet don't even match the type that Martin likes so much.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "But she's all glowing and happy.  She was saying that it's not everyday you meet such a smart man who is so tender and caring.  I guess she really wants a guy who'll spend all his free time worshiping at her feet, literally.", "input": "", "output": "But you didn't like that part."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You barely tolerated Martin's feet worshiping."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So?"}, {"instruction": "I guess she's into it.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe she is.  But you shouldn't care, Anna.  You are free of him, and it's a good thing--you said it yourself."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I want someone to be in love with me and to make love to me, Doctor.  What's wrong with me?", "input": "", "output": "There's nothing wrong with you, Anna.  You are a beautiful, intelligent woman.  And you also just came out of a very emotionally stressful relationship."}, {"instruction": "Are you saying that if I met someone good now, I wouldn't be able to have a relationship with him because I'm too fucked up over Martin?", "input": "", "output": "No.  But you are just finding yourself again..."}, {"instruction": "I didn't feel particularly lost.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  Perhaps you didn't.  But you experimented with a very alternative life style, and you are just regaining your..."}, {"instruction": "If you think that I've given up S&M for good, you're mistaken, Doctor.  I'm not saying that I'm interested in a total fanatical S&M thing, but I like some aspects of it.  I like playing and giving up control and power during sex.  Maybe not all the time, but I like being tied down and...I'll never forget that evening with Gray.", "input": "", "output": "Are you thinking of seeing him again?"}, {"instruction": "No.  No, Doctor.  I realize that what happened with Gray was wrong. But...", "input": "", "output": "What are you thinking?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing, really.", "input": "", "output": "I don't believe that.  You have something in mind.  What is it, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "I was just thinking that I could go to an S&M party and do it.  I've never really played with anyone but Martin and...", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to do it with a stranger?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I know these people.  They're not complete strangers.  And I'm not sure I want any penetration anyway.  Maybe I'll just go and watch.  I liked watching.", "input": "", "output": "You liked watching Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Sick, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "A lot of people are sexually stimulated by voyeurism."}, {"instruction": "I guess.  Never mind, Doctor.  I'm just talking.  I'm upset over Martin.  And I have to get used to the idea of Kathy being around for a few more weeks.  I'm tired.  I'm tired emotionally.  I wish I had someone I could hold close to me.  Don't worry, Doctor, I won't ask you.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "It's time.  I'll see you next week, Doctor Balis.  Thank you for listening to me.  And don't worry, I'm fine.", "input": "", "output": "Call me if you need to."}, {"instruction": "I will.  Good night.", "input": "", "output": "Good night, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. Sorry you were too sick to come in last week.  What was wrong with you?"}, {"instruction": "I had a couple of bad nights in a row and just...I needed to sleep.", "input": "", "output": "So you weren't sick?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't feel well.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you have bad nights?  Are you having trouble sleeping?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of. Kathy pulled one of her trips again--she didn't come home for over twenty-four hours, and I freaked. Before when she pulled this, I told her that I needed to know...she needs to call me if she's going to stay out all night. I spent all night watching bad TV and thinking of horrible rape scenarios.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Did Kathy tell you where she was?"}, {"instruction": "She said it was work, but I don't buy it. She never does a session longer than a couple of hours. It's tiring to dominate someone for so long--her arm gets tired, and her feet swell from wearing those spikes.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think she was doing?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I have these images of drugs and torture.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think she's doing drugs?"}, {"instruction": "Other than pot, I never caught her...well, I haven't seen her do anything lately. When she comes home from these outings, she is not drugged. She's not normal, but she's not drugged.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "There's a different feeling after being dominated than there is after topping someone else.  It's like a different emotional or even physical state. Now I know how Kathy is after one of her dominatrix's sessions. But after she comes back from being out all night, it's different. It's like she's in bottom space--I think that's the terminology.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I guess I felt it after my session with Gray. It's a very strange set of emotions. It was as if I hated myself and at the same time loved how I felt. I'm not sure I'm expressing it well.", "input": "", "output": "You're doing fine. Go on."}, {"instruction": "It wasn't exactly like hate. There was a sense of embarrassment, maybe shame or degredation, and something else. In any case, I sensed that Kathy was more like that when she came home yesterday morning.", "input": "", "output": "Yesterday?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. She's done this several times now.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Well, perhaps Kathy found a new relationship where she gets to be the bottom. You told me before that she prefers being a submissive."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she's more an M than an S. Perhaps. But I wish she would just come out and tell me. We had a big fight again. I said that it was unacceptable behavior--because of her, I didn't sleep and now I feel totally trashed.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "And Kathy agreed, and I know she'll do it again. That was her fourth time.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Let's move on from Kathy for a moment. Tell me about your last two weeks."}, {"instruction": "Well, Kathy is prominently featured in my life. I don't know how to edit her out.", "input": "", "output": "Don't. I just meant let's move on from Kathy's night wanderings--I'm concerned that it's not getting us anywhere."}, {"instruction": "All right.", "input": "", "output": "Last time, I got an impression that you had a plan for fulfilling your S&M fantasies. Would you tell me about that?"}, {"instruction": "That didn't work out like I thought it would.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I went over to one of the parties. I thought I could find a partner there. Or actually, at first, I was just looking for a one time thing and no sex.", "input": "", "output": "You just wanted to experience bottom space again?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I figured I can manage my own sexual satisfaction for a while. But I wanted to feel that thrill...", "input": "", "output": "Like you did with Gray?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "You told me that Kathy did a few sessions with you where she was the dominant one. Was that different?"}, {"instruction": "I never felt anything even similar to what I felt with Gray. I guess I never thought that Kathy had any real power over me. That was more role playing, I think. I never got that certain something during my sessions with her and Martin.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Kathy is just not very good at being a dominant?"}, {"instruction": "It's not that. I think each person has different energy or something. I believe Kathy is perfectly good at being a dominatrix to her clients. But I think it's different with each person. With me, it just wasn't right. It's like sex--you either got it or you don't. And you can't force it--you can't force sexual attraction and energy with someone. You can fake it, though.", "input": "", "output": "And you faked it with Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of, I guess. Sometimes I faked it with Bill, too.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So what happened at the party?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when I got there, it was different.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I never came to one of those things alone. There was always somebody with me. First, it was Kathy, and she was kind of my guru and top. Then, it was with Kathy and Martin, and we declared a more or less monogamous relationship.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, monogamous between the three of us. And then next time, I was there with David. I guess everyone just assumed that he was my new dominant partner, if a bit uneducated and green. He was certainly enthusiastic.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Yes, David was no bottom. But this last time, I came alone. And things changed. While there wasn't anything overt, I felt like I was prey. Does that make any sense?", "input": "", "output": "Did you feel threatened?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, that too. It was strange. There was this feel to the air. I felt like a little gazelle in an open savanna with all these different predators just eying me and fighting among themselves to determine whose going to get me. It made my skin crawl. I had to get out of there.", "input": "", "output": "So you left without playing with anyone?"}, {"instruction": "I had to. I had this feeling that if I didn't, I'd be in real trouble. I felt that I couldn't put myself in a vulnerable position there--and after all, that's what it's all about.", "input": "", "output": "I see. I'm glad you had the presence of mind to leave when it didn't feel right."}, {"instruction": "I'm not stupid, Doctor. I found other ways of getting what I wanted.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. After all, I do live with a professional.", "input": "", "output": "But you said it didn't work between the two of you."}, {"instruction": "I didn't ask her to do anything to me.", "input": "", "output": "I don't understand. What did you do, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "I asked to be a spectator at one of her sessions. I get a fair amount of thrills from just watching, you know.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Kathy had an appointment with four women.", "input": "", "output": "Four?"}, {"instruction": "She was supposed to be a mistress to all of them. They were lovers and wanted to play out a fantasy. Kathy was supposed to force them to have intercourse with each other in as many ways as she could think of.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I came along to watch.  They liked that.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't participate?"}, {"instruction": "No one ever touched me. At one point, I unzipped my jeans, pulled down my panties, and played with myself as I watched them go for it. It's very erotic to see someone so turned on and into it live. I guess that's why the strip clubs are so popular. I was glad that I had spare underwear in my pocket.", "input": "", "output": "You brought spare underwear?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I get so wet...I'm sure you remember, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "Well, maybe not. Perhaps you weren't paying that much attention to the clothes on the floor of your...", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "I know--let's move on. Actually, I think it's the end. I'm tired. I told you I didn't get much sleep last night.", "input": "", "output": "All right, it is getting late. Do you have any plans for the Fourth?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my parents were supposed to come down, but my mom is sick, so...", "input": "", "output": "Oh. I hope she's not very sick, is she?"}, {"instruction": "No, it's just a bad summer cold. Actually, I feel lucky--the whole Kathy business got pushed off to another day.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah. Well, all right. I'll see you in a week, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Sure. Have a good one, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. Please come in. How's life?"}, {"instruction": "It has its moments.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "One of Kathy's patrons died.", "input": "", "output": "Oh no. Is..."}, {"instruction": "It wasn't like it was Kathy's fault. Really.", "input": "", "output": "That's good.  What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently he committed suicide.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Kathy told me about this guy.  He was nineteen or something, very young.  She said that he was strange--he wanted to be punished.  He even gave Kathy a script over the phone that she had to follow when they did it.", "input": "", "output": "A script?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't see it. The first time...", "input": "", "output": "Kathy saw this guy more than once?"}, {"instruction": "She saw him a couple of times. He was one of her first customers, and he became a regular. Kathy told me that she thought he was very depressed.  She even refused to have a session with him two weeks ago because when she got there, he was too fucked up.", "input": "", "output": "Was he under influence?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy said she couldn't tell. But he was crying and raving about being the lowest person on Earth--not worthy of having a life.", "input": "", "output": "What did Kathy do?"}, {"instruction": "She actually called me from his kitchen.  She said the guy, Peter, was screaming like a lunatic. I asked if she was worried for her safety, but she said no. He was just too much for her.  I told her to get out of there, and she did. I don't understand why the police are so taken with Kathy now.", "input": "", "output": "Is Kathy under investigation?"}, {"instruction": "Not really.  The guy jumped out of a fifth story window at four o'clock in the morning.  Kathy was home, and I can testify to that.  He also left a note for his parents.  I don't know what it said.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  How do the police know about Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "She's not hiding what she's doing.  She is not working as a prostitute; she's just beating guys for money.  That's not particularly illegal.  She said that they found her number in his stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Did the police ask you questions?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Two detectives came to the house.  I told them what I knew, which wasn't much.  But I said that Kathy has been staying with me for the past couple of months.  I told them the business she was in.  I didn't hide anything.  And I said that I knew she was at home the night it happened.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "And they seemed to be satisfied with that.", "input": "", "output": "When did all of this happen?"}, {"instruction": "I think he jumped on Friday night...no, I guess that would be Saturday morning.", "input": "", "output": "When was the last time Kathy saw him?"}, {"instruction": "The previous Monday. That was their date night.", "input": "", "output": "I thought you said that Kathy refused to service him?"}, {"instruction": "That was two...three weeks ago.  Last week, he was all right.  He called and left this long begging message telling us what a good boy he was going to be from now on.", "input": "", "output": "Us?  Have you ever talked with him?"}, {"instruction": "Two weeks ago, when Kathy refused to be with him, he called the house about ten times.", "input": "", "output": "I thought you changed your number."}, {"instruction": "No, I got a new number installed, and Kathy arranged to have my old number.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So you talked with him?"}, {"instruction": "I just got tired of the constant ringing and pleading.  I told him that he has to work it out with Kathy.  He begged for my help, and...and nothing.  I didn't do anything.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Did Kathy think he might have been suicidal at the time?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Why would she?", "input": "", "output": "You said she thought he was depressed?"}, {"instruction": "I'm depressed sometimes, too.  But it doesn't mean I'm going to jump.  She's not a psychiatrist, and we told the detectives that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So you don't think there was any relationship between Kathy's dominatrix services and Peter's suicide?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Not directly. The guy wanted to be punished and reassured that he was the lowest of the low.  A lot of guys want that from Kathy--most of them don't jump afterwards.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy is offering services that work on multiple levels."}, {"instruction": "I'd say.", "input": "", "output": "Wait, Anna. What I'm trying to say is that the raw emotions released while someone is experiencing bottom space, as you call it, can sometimes be more than the individual is ready to handle.  If Peter was depressed, he might have used Kathy to help him reaffirm his decision to end his life."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "How does Kathy feel about this?"}, {"instruction": "She's freaked.  But she doesn't think it was her fault.  She just did as she was asked.  It was completely consensual.", "input": "", "output": "Does she still have the script?"}, {"instruction": "No.  She brought it over to his place the first time she met him.  I would gather the police have it, if he hasn't destroyed it, of course.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Is Kathy going to continue with her practice after this?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I think she is really good at what she does, Doctor.  And I think she probably offers a much needed service--there are a lot of guys who want to be in that bottom space and there aren't a lot of women who can put them there.  The few women who like to top tend to be in relationships and don't play around with too many outsiders.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "If it's not Kathy, it would be someone else, perhaps less qualified.  At least Kathy knows how to do it right.  And she also plays the other way, which gives her a certain degree of empathy, I think.", "input": "", "output": "And how do you feel about this?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I've never been so close to someone who actually took his own life. It's unsettling.  And I don't like talking to the police.  I don't want to be involved.", "input": "", "output": "Are you pushing Kathy to move out of your home?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  We talked about her getting an apartment soon.", "input": "", "output": "How soon?"}, {"instruction": "She says she almost has the money for all the fees that she would need to pay.  I feel it's getting close, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Please don't let up on her.  Make sure she knows just how much you want her out of there."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I think she knows.  We've been fighting quite a lot lately, and this Peter thing didn't help.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Did anything else happen last week that you'd like to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "I went to one of Kathy's appointments again.  Don't worry--I didn't masturbate in public again.  I was there as a videographer.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "This couple wanted to videotape the session so they could watch it again and again.  Kathy asked me to do it.  And that's all.", "input": "", "output": "Did you like it?"}, {"instruction": "There's definitely a thrill in watching others have sex in front of you.", "input": "", "output": "But Kathy doesn't..."}, {"instruction": "Kathy didn't.  The couple did everything.  They had sex together, Kathy was there to tell them what to do--she was the ring master, as the guy put it.  And she had a whip to prove it, too.", "input": "", "output": "Does watching fulfills all your S&M fantasies?"}, {"instruction": "It's not a fantasy per se.  It's more like another approach to having sex.  And, yes, observing Kathy's customers in action pretty much does it for me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you still want to be topped?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But I'm willing to wait for just the right guy.  And I'm not sure I would want to do it the way that couple did it.  I don't want to have someone else there.  I want the man I'm with to...I want to feel the power.  There is a reason why men are always depicted with giant muscles and powerful chests and women are shown draping their bodies all over them and wearing nothing but ripped transparent shirts.", "input": "", "output": "What are we talking about?"}, {"instruction": "The covers of stupid romance novels.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't really read that stuff.  Don't worry, Doctor, I still have my IQ intact.  But there is a reason why so many women like reading these stories.  I think they like to imagine how it would feel to have this raw power over them...they want to be topped.  I like being pinned by a man so I can't move my arms and legs.  I like feeling the power.  S&M is more than that, I know.  But that's exciting.  I like the feeling of losing control during sex.  I think lots of women do.  But look, we're out of time.  I'll see you next week, Doctor.  And don't worry, Kathy will move out eventually.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  Take care, Anna.  I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. I'm glad you were able to make it today."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, life's been...but I have all the time...", "input": "", "output": "I'm not following you, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Sorry.", "input": "", "output": "How's Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know exactly.", "input": "", "output": "Is she still in the hospital?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but I heard she'll be released by next week.", "input": "", "output": "You heard?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not really allowed to visit her now.", "input": "", "output": "What? Why not?"}, {"instruction": "They told me that if I knew Kathy's relatives, I should try to contact them and tell them what happened to her.", "input": "", "output": "I agree. You had to tell Kathy's Aunt Helen what happened."}, {"instruction": "Yes, well...", "input": "", "output": "Are you having problems with Helen?"}, {"instruction": "No, no. Helen is being as nice as she could be.  She knows the whole story and is sort of on my side.  She's very grateful to me for taking Kathy in and supporting her and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "So what's the problem?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Kathy sort of has this grandmother, remember?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. She's the woman that Kathy lived with before moving in with you and Martin, right?"}, {"instruction": "She hates my guts.  She blames me for what happened to her precious dear Kathy!  She went off on me in the hospital.  It was horrible.  Helen tried to come to my rescue, but...all the nurses and doctors now think that I'm Kathy's pimp or something.  She made it sound like I pushed Kathy into doing S&M for money just to pay me back her debt.  I kept her from living in the streets, and now I'm responsible not only for her choice of profession but for...just for this whole mess.  They all think I'm some sort of a monster.  I hope I never see any of these people ever again!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Anna."}, {"instruction": "And now the police are questioning me again: \"Did I get a percentage from Kathy's business?\"  I thought I did a good deed; just think what could have happened to her if she was just out there by herself.  I know for a fact that she wouldn't have gone back to Helen or that psychotic grandmother of hers.", "input": "", "output": "Do the police think..."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what they think.  I had to go back there several times.  I tell them the same story over and over again.  What do they want from me?  And I don't know how they found out that I went with Kathy to her appointments a few times.", "input": "", "output": "They asked you about that?"}, {"instruction": "I said that it was just two times really: it was the couple thing and the all women session.  And I didn't participate at all.  I just watched and was sort of there for Kathy's safety.  But they kept asking me if I was into it, if I got off on watching Kathy work.", "input": "", "output": "Here are the tissues."}, {"instruction": "First, I told them no. I didn't think they had any way of finding out.  But they kept pressing and pressing. They told me they knew about everything so I might as well just tell the truth.  But so what?  Even if I did get off on watching, does that mean I did something wrong?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you did anything wrong, Anna.  I have a feeling the police were just trying to pressure you into saying..."}, {"instruction": "It's all that grandmother's fault.  She just came and told them horrible things about me. And who are they going to believe, me or that little gray-haired old woman?", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "I met her once, maybe twice.  I thought she was a nice old lady who didn't believe in doing maintenance on her house and that's all.  What did I know?  I didn't even know that Kathy was related to her in any way.  Kathy lied about everything.  I didn't know!", "input": "", "output": "Calm down, Anna.  The police aren't accusing you of anything, are they?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Did Helen talk with the police?"}, {"instruction": "She must have; they talked with everybody.  They've even subpoenaed SII's phone logs.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever call Kathy at her S&M sessions from work?"}, {"instruction": "No, I never needed to until this last time.  I told them that, but they wanted to see the records anyway.  I had to explain the whole thing to Julian.  He's livid--he doesn't want SII to be involved in any scandal.  I thought they were really nice at first.  They made me believe that they really cared and wanted to find this guy.  But now I feel like I'm in some sort of a witch hunt, and I didn't do anything.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "And Julian told me to take a few days off so I can get a chance to get myself together.  But I think he just wants me to stay away because he's worried about the publicity.  They haven't even said anything about this in the newspapers or on TV.  He's blowing this whole thing out of proportion.  And I hate staying home and worrying and thinking...I haven't been able to sleep.  I have these horrible nightmares...", "input": "", "output": "You sound very tired and stressed."}, {"instruction": "That's what Julian said.", "input": "", "output": "I think he's right.  You've known him for a long time, would he try to..."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Would you please sit down?"}, {"instruction": "I feel so jumpy.  Helen came over to the house and got all of Kathy's things out.  I don't know why that freaked me out so.  It's like everything is out of control.  And the police want me to go to this leather parade or something.  Or is it a festival?", "input": "", "output": "What are you talking about?"}, {"instruction": "They want me to go with one of their undercover officers and try to spy or something.", "input": "", "output": "The police want you to attend some S&M event to see if you can find some information about Kathy's attacker?"}, {"instruction": "So I have to go.  And I don't want to.  I don't think I ever will want to again.  But they think that I'll have a better chance of learning something because everyone knows that Kathy and I were together. And the S&M community is not on particularly friendly terms with the police.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I keep picturing Kathy in that hotel room, and Helen wants me to help them, too.  But they are all so...they just want to get me involved somehow.  And I don't want to, Doctor Balis.  I've had enough.  I just want them to all leave me alone.  And Kathy wrote that...", "input": "", "output": "Here's a tissue box.  What did Kathy do?"}, {"instruction": "When I was at the hospital with her last week, she wrote me...she still can't really talk.  It's so horrible.", "input": "", "output": "What did Kathy..."}, {"instruction": "She wrote that I should be happy--I'm finally getting rid of her and could have my mother over for dinner without worrying.  It's just too much.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell your parents what happened?"}, {"instruction": "No.  They don't even know that Kathy was living with me.  Can you just imagine...oh, god!", "input": "", "output": "Anna, please try..."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, I'll try to sit down.  I didn't notice that I was pacing again.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay.  Have you tried taking melatonin to help you sleep?"}, {"instruction": "No, I forgot.  I'll try it tonight.  I don't remember if it worked last time.", "input": "", "output": "Just try it again.  Call me if it doesn't work."}, {"instruction": "I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Where is this S&M event?"}, {"instruction": "It's in some alley in the city.  It's supposed to be really hardcore. I probably won't even know anyone there.  It's all so pointless.", "input": "", "output": "When is it happening?"}, {"instruction": "It's on the twenty-sixth.", "input": "", "output": "Of this month?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Do they think it's at all dangerous for you to go?"}, {"instruction": "I think it is. I don't want that guy to find me. I...", "input": "", "output": "It's all right. If you really don't think you can do this, just say no.  They can't force you."}, {"instruction": "I know. But Helen...", "input": "", "output": "She'll understand. And I'm sure there are a few policemen who are members of the community anyway, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe.", "input": "", "output": "I think you are very tired and emotionally worn out, Anna. It's probably not a good idea for you to go. I can call the police for you, if you like."}, {"instruction": "I guess. Maybe. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Look.  You don't have to make a decision now; we can talk about this at our next session. You need to get some rest. Go home. Drink some warm milk..."}, {"instruction": "Warm milk?", "input": "", "output": "Warm milk is great.  It's got serotonin in it and it will make you sleepy."}, {"instruction": "But I hate milk.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Skip the warm milk. Don't drink anything caffeinated and take the melatonin. If you're unable to sleep tonight, call me. All right?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Now, are you going to be okay going home?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. Sure. It's not a problem.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Are the police watching your house?"}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "Never mind. Just go home. Call me tomorrow."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...", "input": "", "output": "You need to get some sleep. When was the last time you ate?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.", "input": "", "output": "Was it today?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm...", "input": "", "output": "It's very important to eat and drink."}, {"instruction": "I know, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I know you know. You have very dark circles under your eyes and you look a bit dehydrated..."}, {"instruction": "I'm going.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Please take care of yourself, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. Come in. Sit down."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'm back at work.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Did you talk to Julian about that or was it his idea?"}, {"instruction": "I went to the office after our last session and had a long conversation with him.  I told him everything that happened and how upset and out of control I feel right now.  And I told him that I want to be back at work--it's the only way I can get my sanity back, with your help of course.", "input": "", "output": "So Julian was understanding?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he had no idea about what happened to Kathy. He asked if he should be worried about me.  I told him I was through with all that and just want to get back to living a normal life like everyone else in the office.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He laughed.  He said that he hadn't seen normalcy even in passing in our department.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He told me to report to work the next day.  I've been working all last weekend and late into the night every day after that.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Are you eating?  Are you getting enough sleep?"}, {"instruction": "It's better.  Since I've been working, I'm getting tired and it's much easier to fall asleep.  I don't dream anymore, but that's fine.", "input": "", "output": "Are you eating?"}, {"instruction": "More or less.", "input": "", "output": "I suspect less.  You look like you've lost weight."}, {"instruction": "I guess that's true.  But I try, so don't press me on that, okay?", "input": "", "output": "All right. But if you lose more..."}, {"instruction": "Drop it, Doctor. I'll eat.", "input": "", "output": "I'm surprised that Julian didn't know about Kathy. Didn't they ask for telephone records and..."}, {"instruction": "Yes, but I guess they didn't get into all the details.  I was surprised, too.  I was certain that it was part of the reason Julian asked me to stay home--he didn't want SII to get involved in the S&M scandal. But he's being very supportive now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I probably violated all sorts of laws telling him about Kathy, though. I'm probably violating it now with you.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "The police told me that there's a gag order and no one who's not directly involved in the investigation must know what's going on. That's why there's been nothing in the media about it.  Even the hospital staff is not allowed to discuss the case.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Although the only thing those doctors and nurses know is what Kathy's grandma told them. The police never bothered to set the record straight.  So I hope I never need to be hospitalized there for any reason.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And Kathy...I don't know what's up with her.", "input": "", "output": "She was released from the hospital, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  She went home with Helen on Saturday.  But she gave a statement to the police before that. And I don't know what she told them, but...I can't wait for this whole thing to be over.", "input": "", "output": "What did Kathy tell the police?"}, {"instruction": "I don't really know. It's not like they gave me a transcript of her statement.  But they made me take Tuesday morning off so I could down there and be interrogated by them for the hundredth time.  It was awful, Doctor. They made me come in at eight-thirty in the morning, and they kept me there until three in the afternoon without even a coffee break. I had a horrible headache and by the end, I couldn't even spell my name right.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "They told me that they just wanted to verify a few details from Kathy's statement, but they went on and on.  And they keep pressing me into going to that stupid S&M thing in Dore Alley.", "input": "", "output": "Did you refuse to go?"}, {"instruction": "I told them that I would rather not. I really don't think I would be of any use to them, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "And are you going?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. They are picking me up Sunday morning. I even have to dress up. I don't really own anything appropriate, but they told me that they'll bring me something to wear. God, I can only imagine.", "input": "", "output": "You really don't have to do this, you know."}, {"instruction": "I know. I'm a fool for even thinking about it. I think Kathy said some outrageous things about me in her testimony. And I still feel like I owe it to her to go. Can you believe it?", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel guilty over what happened to her?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think it was my fault, and I don't think I could have done anything to prevent it from happening.", "input": "", "output": "But do you feel guilty?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, sort of. Maybe if I go to this thing, I would be free and would feel no further obligation to help her.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that's true?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I also hate that there's this guy that does this to women, and he's free to do it again. It's sort of my duty to help, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "I believe you also have a duty to yourself, Anna. You've been through a lot and I think..."}, {"instruction": "I'm not good at thinking like that, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I know."}, {"instruction": "Maybe I can just go for a little while.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What do you think Kathy told the police about you?"}, {"instruction": "They kept pressing me on just how involved I was in her business. They said that they found it hard to understand how I would take Kathy in after what she'd done to my relationship with Martin.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "They asked why Kathy used my telephone number to conduct her business. I told them that she used it in secret and I had no knowledge of it for a long time. They already have copies of all my telephone bills and SII telephone logs from my office phone. Oh, and they searched the house again. They took my shoes away as evidence. Do you remember that pair that Martin gave me? I couldn't even walk when he made me wear them.", "input": "", "output": "Why did they take them?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I told them they were mine and that Martin gave them to me. The whole thing...it was like they were playing the good cop/bad cop game with me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "First, they made me believe that Kathy told them I was her business associate. And when I told them it wasn't true, they pretended not to believe me. Then this detective talked with me as if I was part of his team. He made me feel like it was my duty and responsibility to help them get this guy. He made me feel like I was one of them. It was all very strange.", "input": "", "output": "Have you considered consulting with a lawyer?"}, {"instruction": "Why would I do that? I didn't do anything.", "input": "", "output": "I know. But just in case, I think it might be a good idea."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, Doctor. With all their manipulative games, the police haven't actually accused me of anything. And I don't believe that anyone would take Kathy's grandmother's ravings seriously. I don't even think that Kathy herself is a very credible person really.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps. I just don't want you to unwittingly get yourself into a sticky situation, Anna."}, {"instruction": "It's too late for that, isn't it, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. You sound much more focused today."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I don't know whether it's because I'm just too tired or if I'm getting some emotional separation from the events involving Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But it's true, I feel more together. I think work really helped, too.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps."}, {"instruction": "I think things will be getting better for me soon. I'll go to this thing on Sunday and that's it. There's nothing more they can ask of me.", "input": "", "output": "If you change your mind about Sunday, give me a call and I'll talk to the detectives myself. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "All right. But I'm not sure they know about you, Doctor Balis. And I told them that I wouldn't talk about the case with anyone, even my parents. So...", "input": "", "output": "I think it will be okay. And I'm sure they know about me."}, {"instruction": "Why? Do you think they have my personnel records? Oh god! Of course they do. That's why they were asking me about the people in my department.", "input": "", "output": "What did they ask?"}, {"instruction": "They asked tons of questions, like who I dated, and did Kathy know and service people from SII, and did I know of any bizarre sexual preferences of people in my office.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I don't think I told them much, but who knows? I was really losing it at the end. I did tell them about the porno movies I think. Or did they ask me?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "God, I hope...I can just see them putting together the porno and pizza nights, and the fucking on the couches, and Martin and his foot fetish, and the S&M outing I sponsored for the guys in my department...", "input": "", "output": "Maybe you should talk to a lawyer, Anna. It couldn't hurt."}, {"instruction": "But it would be like admitting that I've done something wrong.", "input": "", "output": "No, I don't think..."}, {"instruction": "Sure it is. Isn't that why people go to criminal attorneys? They've committed a crime, but I didn't. Think of how the police will react when I tell them I want an attorney.  I don't need an attorney. And I'm not charged with anything either. I think it's a bad idea, Doctor. I really do.", "input": "", "output": "Think about it..."}, {"instruction": "And I think they did ask me if I consulted with an attorney.", "input": "", "output": "When did they ask you that?"}, {"instruction": "The first time they interviewed me, I think. Maybe the second.", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "Now I'm very upset, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't mean to make you upset. I just want to make sure..."}, {"instruction": "I know, I'm sorry. You're the only person truly on my side, Doctor.  What would I do without you?", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "Please don't throw me out just yet.", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "I know it's late. Why don't you ask me how my work is?", "input": "", "output": "How is your work, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I was going to go to New York in a few weeks for an on-site inspection of a big SIIMole installation, but...do you think they'll let me go?", "input": "", "output": "The police?"}, {"instruction": "Do I have to remain in the state or something?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know..."}, {"instruction": "So that was a bad question.", "input": "", "output": "How are your parents?"}, {"instruction": "They are well. I'm going to visit them next weekend...the weekend after the S&M thing. But I don't want to tell them anything, Doctor. Really, you can't make me.", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't..."}, {"instruction": "Everything we talk about comes back to...I think I should go now, Doctor. Okay?", "input": "", "output": "All right.  Call me, if you need me. And I'd be happy to talk to the detectives on your behalf if you feel like you don't want to go to..."}, {"instruction": "It's all right. I'll be a good girl and do as they tell me, and maybe they'll leave me alone. Have a good week, Doctor. And thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna.  Good luck on Sunday."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. What happened to you last time?"}, {"instruction": "Didn't I tell you I was going to be in New York?", "input": "", "output": "No.  You mentioned there was a possibility of a business trip to New York in a couple of weeks, but..."}, {"instruction": "Oh God, I'm so sorry, Doctor.  I didn't even think...I'm really sorry.", "input": "", "output": "Apology accepted. Please sit down, Anna.  How are you feeling these days?  Did you go to the Dore Alley event?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I went.  We got there first thing in the morning, about eleven, I think.  Two detectives I've never met before showed up at my door even before I had a chance to shower. They sat in my kitchen in these outrageous open-butt leather pants while I was getting ready.  I swear my neighbors must think all kinds of wild things go on in this house.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Did they bring you something to wear as well?"}, {"instruction": "They got me these very short leather shorts and a bra.  I refused the bra, but wore the shorts.  I put on a black T-shirt instead, and they seemed to be happy.  They had this collar they were going to put on me, but I refused it, too.  I let them put the leather cuffs on, though.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  You really didn't have to do any of this, right?"}, {"instruction": "I guess technically it was a favor, but that's not how they made me feel.", "input": "", "output": "How did you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I felt compelled. There was no way for me to get out of going.  They are so good at manipulation.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I felt it was my price for going to New York.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?  You were free to go, Anna.  You're not under investigation any more, are you?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Did you think more about seeing a lawyer?"}, {"instruction": "I had a long conversation with my dad last week.  I told him everything that happened...well, not everything.  But I told him about Kathy, and what happened to her, and how I'm involved.", "input": "", "output": "That's very good.  How did he react?"}, {"instruction": "He was appropriately freaked.  He was going to talk with the detectives, but I discouraged him--I told him it would get me into more trouble.  But he doesn't know about the S&M thing, though.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I did a lot of heavy editing.  I didn't tell him about Martin and Kathy and me, for example.  I never told him that I was into it.  I just said that I felt compelled as a human being to help Kathy when she showed up at my door.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So your dad doesn't really know what went on?"}, {"instruction": "He knows enough, Doctor.  It was a shock as it was; I didn't want him to have a heart attack or something.  We agreed that the whole thing will stay just between me and him.  We are not going to tell mother about any of it. She would really freak out.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So what exactly did you tell your dad?"}, {"instruction": "I told him how Kathy came to me without any place to stay, all alone, in need of help.  I told him a little about Kathy's past, and how her parents died when she was very young, and what a horrible childhood she had. My dad was sympathetic. He told me, if it was him, he probably wouldn't have been able to turn Kathy away either.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "He was angry at me for not coming to him sooner. But I told him that everything just went out of my control and things fell apart. I guess I should have told him something earlier. I told him that it was stupid of me not to tell, and he understood.", "input": "", "output": "So your dad is going to cover for you with your mom now?"}, {"instruction": "He's good at that.  We did it before when I totaled my first car--one of the reasons I don't really have a car now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Is your dad going to help you?"}, {"instruction": "He drove up to San Francisco, and we met with his friend.  His friend is a lawyer. But since he's a friend of the family, I don't really feel like it was a true consultation.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't feel like I would have to disclose our conversation to the police, for example.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, are the police asking if you are talking to a lawyer? Moreover, your conversation is protected by attorney-client privilege.  But that's only if this person is acting as your attorney when you talked to him. Did this lawyer tell you something different?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't feel like it was a true consultation.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Because there was never any exchange of cash for services...", "input": "", "output": "That doesn't matter."}, {"instruction": "And I didn't tell him everything.  He knows far less than the police does, even less than my dad.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "My dad was there--I wasn't going to volunteer information to this guy about my sexual preferences in front of my dad.", "input": "", "output": "Did this man give you any advice?"}, {"instruction": "He pretty much recommended what you did.", "input": "", "output": "And what is that?"}, {"instruction": "He told me not to let them pressure me into anything.  And that if at any point I start to feel like there's something wrong, I should immediately tell them to stop and tell them that I need to consult with my attorney.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Does your dad know about the Dore Alley event?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I told him that the police wanted my help in their investigation and that they asked me to go undercover to an S&M event. I guess \"undercover\" is the wrong term, huh?", "input": "", "output": "How did your dad feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "At first, he was freaked.  But then he was proud of me for doing something so courageous.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "I told him how strongly I felt about the need to catch Kathy's assailant. What she did might have been wrong, but he still had no right to do what he did to her.", "input": "", "output": "And your dad was supportive of your efforts to help the police in their investigation?"}, {"instruction": "As I said, I didn't really tell him everything.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How are you going to keep your dad from talking with the police?"}, {"instruction": "I told him that I was under a gag order and that I violated it to talk to him. I said that I would be in trouble if he interfered. Don't look at me like that, Doctor.  What I told him was true--I promised not to talk about Kathy's investigation with anyone, and that included him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was sort of funny.", "input": "", "output": "What was?"}, {"instruction": "My dad.  It's like he's a character from a made-for-TV movie or something.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "He's very much into this secrecy and getting the bad guy stuff. And he's proud of me.", "input": "", "output": "Proud of you?"}, {"instruction": "He's very proud of me for taking risks and helping the police get the bad guy.  Oh, I know that he's very worried about me.  He now calls me several times a day, every day.  But it's nice.  I miss my parents.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad your dad can give you some emotional support."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And he also promised to tell his professor friend--whose house I'm living in--about this whole mess.", "input": "", "output": "That's nice of him. Does he know about the dungeon and his friend's affinity for S&M?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "I have a feeling you didn't really tell your dad much, did you?"}, {"instruction": "How could I?  He's my dad.", "input": "", "output": "Won't he find out eventually?"}, {"instruction": "His friends are not going to tell him, I'm not going to tell him, the police are not going to tell him...", "input": "", "output": "It would be better if he learns the truth from you, Anna."}, {"instruction": "He knows enough. And I now feel like I have someone to talk to...", "input": "", "output": "You don't really."}, {"instruction": "It's like I'm my dad's hero now.  It's very sweet. I like it very much, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "All right. We'll come back to your parents later. How did it go at the Dore Alley event?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we got there early. There weren't a lot of people yet.  There was this giant set of speakers at the entrance, playing some horrible music very loudly.  I couldn't even hear myself think. That whole block was pretty much clear of people because of that stupid noise. So we went to the actual Dore Alley.  It's a very little street--one block long. And there, they were playing nice jazz, and there were little booths set up to sell S&M paraphernalia.", "input": "", "output": "Did you see anyone you knew?"}, {"instruction": "I saw Grey.", "input": "", "output": "Really?  How did that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "It was unpleasant, mostly.  He was with two people he was leading on a leash. It was sort of gross. But he looked good.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Did he notice you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. But I walked past him without even saying hello.  My two tagalongs were pissed at me for not really making an effort to start up conversations.  But as far as I was concerned, my job was to just have them be seen with me.  And that's all.", "input": "", "output": "They were pretending to be your masters?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. They even dragged me to a booth with all these paddles and whips and stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And they made me put out my arms so they could hit me with this stuff a few times. That was unpleasant.  They were just trying to do what everyone else there was doing. But I thought they went too far.", "input": "", "output": "Did you stop them?"}, {"instruction": "I gave it right back to them.  It was sort of fun to spank the bare ass of a detective.  And they couldn't really do much about it.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "But it was generally very pleasant.  I saw a lot of people I knew there.  Everyone was nice.  They said hello to each other and gave each other little cheek-kisses.  It was very civilized.  If not for the naked asses, exposed dicks, and bare breasts--and if not for the most outlandish outfits and conversations--it would have been as fun as a knitting convention.", "input": "", "output": "I doubt that."}, {"instruction": "No really, people were very nice to each other.  Very nice. It was a bit surreal, even. There was this guy dressed only in ropes with his hands tied behind his back. He would come along and say something like, \"Darling! It's so nice to see you, dear.\" Frankly, I expected far worse.", "input": "", "output": "How long did you stay?"}, {"instruction": "I left after an hour.  The guys stayed.  I don't really know what happened as the afternoon progressed.  I was out of there. And then I was in New York.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Well, we're out of time. Please let me know next time you need to miss a session."}, {"instruction": "I'm very sorry about that, Doctor. I've been having problems dealing with reality lately.  I missed a bunch of appointments last week.  I keep forgetting somehow.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  We should talk about that next time."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  Have a good evening, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You too, Anna.  Take care of yourself."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. Please come in. Hmm."}, {"instruction": "What is it?", "input": "", "output": "You don't look well. Are you ill?"}, {"instruction": "No. But I always tend to look worse just before my period.", "input": "", "output": "I haven't particularly noticed that. You've been..."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  God, everyone is asking me whether I'm eating and sleeping well. I'm fine. I'm just tired. And unfortunately, I'm more tired emotionally than physically.", "input": "", "output": "So you're not sleeping well."}, {"instruction": "Not exactly.  I'm having problems falling asleep. But once I finally do, I get a few good hours.  I've even been late for work a few times this week--I just couldn't get up in the morning.", "input": "", "output": "When do you actually go to bed?"}, {"instruction": "Not very late.  I tend to be in bed by eleven-thirty or so.", "input": "", "output": "When do you fall asleep?"}, {"instruction": "Around four.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been taking Melatonin?"}, {"instruction": "It doesn't seem to help much anymore.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Do you get anxious as you try to fall asleep?"}, {"instruction": "I used to, but not any more.  I just think, and think, and think.", "input": "", "output": "What are you thinking about?"}, {"instruction": "About my life, mostly.  Things have really gotten out of my control, haven't they?", "input": "", "output": "You do have a few problems."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. But it won't be that much longer.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I think they got the guy.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy's attacker?"}, {"instruction": "I was asked to do a line-up...", "input": "", "output": "But you never saw the guy, right?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I thought I saw two of the guys from the line-up before at one of the parties.", "input": "", "output": "S&M parties?"}, {"instruction": "I was sure about one, and I'm pretty sure about the other.  But it's hard--I saw them under very different circumstances.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I guess the police didn't really have enough open-butt pants to dress the entire line-up of suspects.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ask?"}, {"instruction": "I told them that I thought I remembered one of the guys might have had a spider tattoo on his butt.", "input": "", "output": "Did they check?"}, {"instruction": "They thanked me for the information, but they are very closed-mouthed about everything.", "input": "", "output": "I'm surprised you were able to recognize two guys from the line-up."}, {"instruction": "Me too. I thought that they usually have only one real suspect and the rest are just undercover police officers.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Perhaps you saw the officers at the party."}, {"instruction": "That's what I told my dad.  He agreed that it was strange.  But they might have been spying on this S&M group for quite some time.  Who knows? My dad is very resourceful, though.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "He's been pulling strings all over the place.  I didn't even know he had such an impressive list of connections.", "input": "", "output": "What was he able to find out?"}, {"instruction": "He said that they believe the person who attacked Kathy was the father of the boy who committed suicide.  Remember him?", "input": "", "output": "The guy who was very depressed..."}, {"instruction": "Obviously he was depressed--he committed suicide, for god's sake.  I think that's qualifies him as depressed.", "input": "", "output": "I meant..."}, {"instruction": "I know.  It's just sad.  This guy loses his son and tries to go after the boy's dominatrix.  Maybe if he paid more attention to his son in the first place, he would still be around today.  But instead, he was looking for revenge after the fact.  The poor mother will lose both her son and her husband.  Why didn't he think of that?  How is she supposed to deal with such loss?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Has Kathy identified this man?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't seen Kathy in forever.  How should I know?  My dad said that they found his fingerprints in my house.  That's real creepy.", "input": "", "output": "But you never saw him?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.  I only saw a few of Kathy's customers.  We had a rule that she couldn't practice her business at the house.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure that rule meant much to Kathy."}, {"instruction": "Well, there's not much I can do about any of it now, is there? God, the professor has some homecoming in front of him.  Did I tell you that they have confiscated--excuse me, \"taken as evidence\"--thousands of dollars worth of his S&M equipment?", "input": "", "output": "I didn't realize they took that much."}, {"instruction": "The dungeon is basically stripped, and their large collection of floggers from around the world is gone.  They used to travel and pick up cultural items they found attractive to add to their collection.  They had space-age stuff--floggers made out of the latest technology alloys and plastics--and ritualistic whips and canes carved out of exotic woods and adorned with brass and silver ornaments.  They were very pretty.  There are still a few pieces left on the living room walls.  The police didn't think they were used--they were covered with dust and cobwebs.  But I'll bet the professor tested every single one of his precious artifacts.", "input": "", "output": "When are they coming back?"}, {"instruction": "When my dad contacted them and told them about the investigation, they decided to prolong their trip for a few months.  They don't want to come back and have to deal with the police, and the investigation, and the trial, and whatever.  They'd just rather wait it out.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I guess that's a reasonable strategy under the circumstances."}, {"instruction": "I can't imagine them actively pursuing their claims for the S&M accouterments.  They are too much in the closet for that.  It makes my dad happy.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "When he learned how much all of that stuff was worth--just one flogger can set a user back several hundred dollars--he thought it was an appropriate punishment for getting his daughter into so much trouble.", "input": "", "output": "Your dad is blaming his friends for your current situation?"}, {"instruction": "I know it's unreasonable, but it's sweet.  I like it.  I like being close to my dad again.", "input": "", "output": "I think you're doing too much lying to consider..."}, {"instruction": "I don't care.  I get enough shit all around, I want my dad to think that I'm a good and noble person.", "input": "", "output": "Nothing that happened to you makes you into a bad person, Anna.  You don't think of yourself as bad, do you?"}, {"instruction": "There are moments.  All my friends are married or are in steady relationships.  They are happy to share their lives with someone special.  They feel special.  But when I feel special, it's because I'm a freak.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think of yourself as a freak?"}, {"instruction": "The last year and a half doesn't particularly put me into a mainstream category, unless you consider the lunatics from Jerry Springer's show normal.", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "I want what my friends have--I want a normal, stable relationship based on love and not on some abnormal perversion.  I want to be close to someone.  There's so much going on in my life right now, and I can't share any of it.  I talk to you about some things.  I talk to my dad about others.  I tell fairy tales to my office mates.  But I'm not intimate enough with anyone to tell all the things I feel.", "input": "", "output": "We can talk about your feelings here..."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But it's not the same as talking to someone in my bed at night.  You refuse to hold me tight and make everything better.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But do you know how long it's been since someone made love to me?  It's been almost seven months now, Doctor.  Am I really so unpleasant?  Am I really such an undeserving person?", "input": "", "output": "Anna, you..."}, {"instruction": "I know you accept me for what I am...well, as much as you really know me.", "input": "", "output": "I think I know you pretty well..."}, {"instruction": "Not in the way I want you to, Doctor.  But skip it--I know when I'm being rejected, you don't have to do it over and over again.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not rejecting you, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I want someone to make love to me, Doctor.  And I want to love, to make love, to...", "input": "", "output": "Here are some tissues."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. God, I guess I'm really more tired than I thought.  I'm sorry, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "It's all right, Anna.  You've been having a very rough time lately."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And you definitely need to get some rest.  Do you want me to prescribe some sleeping aids for you?"}, {"instruction": "No. Those things scare me.  I think I'll just go to the movies or something.  Do you know anything good playing?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure."}, {"instruction": "We can check it out together?", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "Have a nice weekend, Charles.  I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna. Take care."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "How are you doing, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "A bit better physically.", "input": "", "output": "That's good.  Are you getting enough sleep?"}, {"instruction": "More or less. I guess it's better. Don't I look better?", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Don't take offense, Anna. I'm concerned about you."}, {"instruction": "I know, thanks.", "input": "", "output": "How are you doing otherwise?"}, {"instruction": "Emotionally?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. How are you feeling?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Martin came by to see me.", "input": "", "output": "Really? What did he want?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he apparently broke up with his girlfriend.", "input": "", "output": "And he thought he should tell you about it?"}, {"instruction": "You don't like him, do you, Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "It's not..."}, {"instruction": "That's all right, you don't have to like him.", "input": "", "output": "What did he want of you?"}, {"instruction": "He never actually came out and said it, but it sounded like he really missed me.", "input": "", "output": "I bet."}, {"instruction": "It was flattering, actually. He came by my office and invited me for a cup of coffee. I said okay--there didn't seem to be a need to treat him with hostility. And frankly, I thought he was going to talk about Kathy. I haven't heard anything more about the investigation than what I told you last week, and I thought it would be fun to compare notes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So we went across the street to Starbucks. He said that he didn't have any information about the case.  He thought that what my dad found out was interesting, but that's not why he wanted to see and speak with me.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he was very sorry for what happened between us.  He said that it's not what he had hoped for.  He said that I was right about Kathy and he should have listened to me.", "input": "", "output": "That's all well and good, but it's a bit too late, isn't it?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but it was good to hear.  He felt like he had really blown it.  He said that I was the best thing that had happened to him and he had just botch the whole thing up.", "input": "", "output": "Why was he telling you all this?"}, {"instruction": "I asked that, too. He said that he thought I should know how he really feels. He told me that he loved me.", "input": "", "output": "Now or then?"}, {"instruction": "I don't really know.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He wasn't trying to push himself back on me. It wasn't about that. It all felt more like an apology. And I told him that, in retrospect, I did a lot of thing that were harmful to our relationship, too. I should have been more assertive about my needs.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, and?"}, {"instruction": "He asked if we could be friends.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you can be?"}, {"instruction": "I told him that I didn't know if we could be friends. I think I basically forgave him--it was mostly Kathy's involvement and manipulation that put an end to our relationship. But I now know that it wouldn't have worked out in the long run anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And did you tell him that?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't a good time. Plus, while I might have sort of forgiven him, I haven't forgotten all the pain that I had to go through...that I'm still feeling sometimes. Anyway...", "input": "", "output": "How did you feel after talking with Martin?"}, {"instruction": "It was good. It put a few things into perspective. It made me see that I wasn't the only one hurting--he suffered, too. And that was good to know. I felt like he put high value on the time we had together. Bill never did that--he never came to me after we broke up and tried to...well, he never tried to make me feel better about the time we spent together.", "input": "", "output": "So did you make any plans to get together with Martin in the near future?"}, {"instruction": "No. But he has been coming to my office every day for the last few days.", "input": "", "output": "And what does he want?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing, really. He told me what they are working on up there in the Future Technologies department.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Apparently, SII is developing these chips that can be implanted into a human body, and that can improve some of the interface issues between computers and their human masters.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I can tell that you're really interested in this topic, so I'm going to tell you all about it. They've done this experiment where they took one of the people from the department and implanted this small chip into his upper arm. Since the whole SII building is wired, the guy was able to open doors, and start up his computer, load his favorite applications, and control the lights in the building, all without having to manipulate anything manually. It was like, \"Hello, Dave. How are you today, Dave? You've got e-mail, Dave.\"", "input": "", "output": "Sounds very interesting."}, {"instruction": "It's great. They only did this for ten days, because after that, the implant becomes accepted by the body and it becomes much harder to take it out. Since that was only a prototype, they didn't want to experiment any further. But in a few months, they'll have a brand new model, and they'll implant that one for a whole year. Martin said that they think they might have a product ready for market by the year 2000. That would be really cool, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps. But I think it's just as easy to open doors using door handles..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, you have to think much bigger than that, Doctor. Martin said that they have a slew of applications on their drawing boards. And I could become part of their development team if I want.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I told you that once the product is developed, I feel like the best part of the job is over. All I do now is take care of customization of SIIMole for a bunch of boring insurance companies and banks. I like being in the development phase. I function better. I'm happier. And I think I can contribute more.", "input": "", "output": "So you're really interested in this job?"}, {"instruction": "I think so.", "input": "", "output": "And Martin would help you get it?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he would be happy to.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And you would have to be working closely with him, right?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not necessarily. They are gearing up for a large group of developers. I would be part of a team of something like thirty programmers. Martin and I would certainly see each other more, but...", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like Martin might be manipulating you into getting back together with him?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so. I think he knows that ultimately we were not a good match. We had fun, but it wouldn't have gone anywhere even if Kathy was not part of the equation.", "input": "", "output": "I think you should be very clear on this point with Martin. If you plan on working closely together, you'll need to carefully explain your feelings and make sure that Martin harbors no hopes of rekindling a romantic relationship with you."}, {"instruction": "I can do that, I guess. But I don't think there's much need. I think I was clear about that already.", "input": "", "output": "But Martin will be doing you a favor by helping you transfer into his department, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I don't think...I guess I can talk with him again.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "So overall, this week has been better than the one before.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel that way because of your conversations with Martin?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe, but I'm not sure I want to give him that much credit. I think it has more to do with being left alone and not having the police torment me day after day. Also, I like the idea of not having to move soon. I just want some time to myself now, and the professor and his wife will probably give me all the space I need in the foreseeable future.  How long do you think this investigation and then the trial will go on?", "input": "", "output": "I have no idea."}, {"instruction": "I figure I'm safe until next Summer or so. So I can relax. I'm planning on going on vacation with my parents. That should be very nice.", "input": "", "output": "When are you planning on going?"}, {"instruction": "Well, probably not until January--my dad teaches a class this semester. But I'm still looking forward to that. And I'm really excited about this new job prospect. It's everything I want, and I'll be still working for the same company. I might even get a raise, too, if this happens. So life is getting better, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad. All right, Anna, our time is up. I'll see you in a week."}, {"instruction": "All right. Oh, I'll be gone the week after next--the Seybold conference is in town and I'm going to that.", "input": "", "output": "That's not a problem. When is it?"}, {"instruction": "The part I'm going to is the first week of September.", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Where have you been?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. Please come in."}, {"instruction": "Where have you been, Doctor? I've been trying to reach you, and they just pushed me off onto another therapist. Are you trying to get rid of me specifically or am I getting the general brush-off treatment? How could you have left me like that?", "input": "", "output": "Anna, please sit down. I was away on a family emergency..."}, {"instruction": "For two weeks?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, for two weeks."}, {"instruction": "What happened?", "input": "", "output": "My dad had another stroke..."}, {"instruction": "He had one about a year ago, right?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "I remember. Is he all right?", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to yell at you, Charles. Is there something I can do?", "input": "", "output": "No, it's..."}, {"instruction": "Is he...is he...", "input": "", "output": "No, he is not dead. But it was a very bad stroke, and I came out to New York to be with him. Now, what happened to you? Why are you so agitated?"}, {"instruction": "I'm so sorry. I hope he...you father will be okay. I feel so bad. I...", "input": "", "output": "Anna, please sit down. I'm grateful for your concern, but I would like to start our session. What happened? What got you so upset?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy's gone. No one knows where she is. She's just gone. One morning she was there, and then she was gone.", "input": "", "output": "How did you find out?"}, {"instruction": "Her Aunt Helen called that afternoon. She was hoping that Kathy would be with me. But I've had no contact with Kathy for over a month now. I didn't even want to talk to her.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't want to talk to Helen?"}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't mind talking with Helen. She didn't drag me through the dirt like everyone else did. I actually feel for her. And she was so freaked. She really loves Kathy, I guess. Or maybe she just feels responsible for her. Or guilty...I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Please sit down. What did Helen tell you about Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy had been staying with Helen.  When she went to Kathy's room around lunch time, she found the room empty. She was there in the morning; it was all normal in the morning. But later, she was gone. All the clothes were gone, too, and her toothbrush was missing.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like Kathy left on her own."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, except that the window to her room was broken into from the outside.", "input": "", "output": "That's weird."}, {"instruction": "So I told Helen that I had no idea where Kathy was. And then the police started calling me.", "input": "", "output": "The police?"}, {"instruction": "They said that they thought it was a case of abduction, and they wanted to go through all my telephone logs and messages again.", "input": "", "output": "But you haven't heard from Kathy, right?"}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Was Kathy's room in disarray when Helen got there?"}, {"instruction": "No, it was immaculate.  But Kathy was a neat freak. But that's not inconsistent with her running away, is it?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So are you involved in this investigation now?"}, {"instruction": "And Martin, too. They think it must be someone we all know.", "input": "", "output": "Do they have Kathy's assailant in custody?"}, {"instruction": "You mean the father of that suicide victim?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what happen to that. My dad told me about him, he could have been wrong. I haven't heard any more on that than what I've told you already.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Do the police think that the kidnapper and the assailant is the same person?"}, {"instruction": "Oh...", "input": "", "output": "Anna, please sit down. You're making me dizzy."}, {"instruction": "Sorry.", "input": "", "output": "Are you in any danger?"}, {"instruction": "Martin is staying with me just in case.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He was worried, too, and he thought it would be best if I wasn't alone in the house at night. Kathy never gave me back the keys.", "input": "", "output": "Change the locks."}, {"instruction": "I did last Friday. But we made a spare garage door clicker for her.", "input": "", "output": "They can be reprogrammed, too."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll do that.", "input": "", "output": "Do your parents know Martin is staying with you?"}, {"instruction": "When I explained the situation--that it might be someone Martin and I know--my dad thought it was probably safer with Martin around. But he wanted the police to watch the house.", "input": "", "output": "Are they doing that?"}, {"instruction": "They flat out refused, those bastards. They never got the guy, and now they don't even care if I'm next.", "input": "", "output": "Well, don't jump to conclusions, Anna. They might know something you don't."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "How about staying with your parents and telecommuting to work? Is that a possibility?"}, {"instruction": "Well, first of all, I don't want my parents to be involved. I don't want to worry about them, too. And second, I've changed my job; now I'm part of the Futurists' department. I don't want to be away just when I need to learn so many things. I'm playing catch up right now. I can't telecommute.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "By the way, I'm very happy about my new job, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I can see that."}, {"instruction": "How?", "input": "", "output": "It's the first time you stopped twitching since you got here."}, {"instruction": "Twitching? I guess. I just can't stay still. If I don't have something I can focus all my attention onto, I just drift into hysteria.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Martin tried to give me some pot to calm my nerves, and that totally freaked me out. I got completely paranoid and jumped at every crack and squeak. He said that he almost considered taking me to the hospital when I stared to rip at my fingers. See?", "input": "", "output": "That's really bad."}, {"instruction": "It's much better now. I was wearing sixteen band aids at one point.", "input": "", "output": "Sixteen?"}, {"instruction": "I ripped at my toes, too. It was ugly. I'm staying away from pot for the time being.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been smoking regularly?"}, {"instruction": "Well, remember how I had problems sleeping?", "input": "", "output": "You were using marijuana as a sleeping aid?"}, {"instruction": "It works: I go out like a light. Of course, I need five cups of coffee to get going the next morning, but I was getting desperate.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Why didn't you tell me?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I did tell you that I couldn't sleep. And pot does wonders for the appetite, too.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's not like it's the first time, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "How are you sleeping now?"}, {"instruction": "It's bad. I know that I'm having some very serious nightmares, but I don't remember a thing when I come to. It's very weird, I usually remember my dreams. I make a special effort.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And how about Melatonin?"}, {"instruction": "How about it? It doesn't work at all.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you drink coffee at night?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, but I have to in order to make it through the day. I have to keep up my attention level, there's so much to learn.", "input": "", "output": "How many cups a day do you think you drink?"}, {"instruction": "I average about six.", "input": "", "output": "Do you drink Coke?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. We have a free supply of Cokes in our department.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And tea?"}, {"instruction": "At tea time only. It's one of the traditions in my department--we do tea at four in the afternoon with pastries and lots of Devonshire cream.", "input": "", "output": "You have to cut down on your caffeine intake, Anna. That might be part of your sleeping disorder problem. Get them to get you a caffeine free soda and tea, and then you can still feel part of the team without the negative side effects."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I'm serious. You have to get your life in order. Sleep deprivation is dangerous. It affects your judgment as well as your mood and your ability to cope. And you definitely need your wits about you. I don't know if you're really in danger, but taking precautions until they find Kathy and figure out the rest of it is critical. And I'm pretty sure that having Martin living with you is not a good idea. Can't you stay with a girlfriend?"}, {"instruction": "I...", "input": "", "output": "Are you sleeping with him?"}, {"instruction": "No!", "input": "", "output": "Anna, you are worrying me."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Please sit down. And stop picking at your hands."}, {"instruction": "I've got to go. You're too negative, and you are freaking me out.", "input": "", "output": "I don't mean to freak you out, Anna. I just want to get a handle on your life."}, {"instruction": "I've got to go. Martin will be freaked if I'm even five minutes late. He's really worried about me, too.", "input": "", "output": "All right. But I need you to call me if you start to feel things spiraling out of control..."}, {"instruction": "I've tried to call you but...I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about your dad. I hope he'll be okay. I'm sorry. I'll see you next week. And I'll be good, I promise.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. So you've been sick again?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I seem not to have any resistance at all. A person just has to sneeze in my general direction for me to come down with a 103 fever.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How much weight have you lost this summer?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not really sure. Maybe twenty pounds?  I went down about two dress sizes, see?", "input": "", "output": "Keep your pants on, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I wasn't going to take them off completely, Doctor. Relax. But see?  I've lost almost four inches off my waist.", "input": "", "output": "Have you talked to a doctor about it?"}, {"instruction": "I'm talking to you.", "input": "", "output": "I don't like that you've been getting sick so much, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Neither do I, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You've got to start taking better care of yourself."}, {"instruction": "I'm trying. And my new department is very good about that, too.  They make sure that we eat well, and when we stay late, they provide cars to take us home.  This is a much better deal than being a programmer, I tell you.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you like your new job."}, {"instruction": "It's great. I can't tell you what I'm working on, but it's way cool. And I like the people in my department. Do you know that the average IQ in our section of the building is about 150?", "input": "", "output": "That's very impressive."}, {"instruction": "And everyone is nice, too. Oh, we've been doing this little side project. You might like it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we have this theory about Clinton.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you really want to talk about today?"}, {"instruction": "Bear with me. We have this theory that Clinton's current difficulties have really been carefully orchestrated by none other than his lovely wife, Hillary. Let me explain.", "input": "", "output": "Briefly."}, {"instruction": "Briefly, if you insist. Given all that we now know, we believe that Clinton had several extramarital affairs prior to becoming president, and that Hillary knew all about them. But she was very ambitious and was willing to forgive her husband's indiscretions as long as she was able to get into the White House. But the idiot wouldn't stop fooling around--real stupid.", "input": "", "output": "I agree."}, {"instruction": "Well, good old Hillary didn't like that, but she wanted to insure staying in the White House for two terms.", "input": "", "output": "So that's your theory?"}, {"instruction": "We think...", "input": "", "output": "We?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, our department. We think that Hillary knew about Bill and Monica. But yelling and screaming at her husband wouldn't have really yielded anything for her.  And she can't get divorced.  So, like any woman in her position, she wanted revenge. But a subtle and kind of ingenius revenge--she's really smart, remember.  So Hillary went out and campaigned for Bill. She went on the TV shows and said that this was a right wing republican conspiracy to malign her good husband.  She told everyone how she believed her husband was wrongfully accused. She said that Bill just wants to help people because of his innate good nature and deeply held religious convictions. That was why he was helping Monica get a job and why he was being nice to her in general.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "If you don't believe me, read Starr's report. The staff members of the White House testified that Hillary kept insisting those were Bill's only motivations for seeing Monica.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I bet when Bill came to Hillary to talk about the Paula Jones lawsuit, he lied and told Hillary he had never taken his pants off or asked her for a blow job--he said that it was all politically motivated.  Hillary told him that she believed him completely--and what's more, she kept pushing him deeper into the shit by insisting that he repeat his lie to everyone.  \"I believe you, honey.  And I want everyone else to believe you as well.  I know that you'd never lie to me.\"  Hillary's running his legal strategy, so she probably insisted that he not settle the Jones lawsuit--not at any price. Just think about it. If Clinton settled with Paula, this whole thing wouldn't be an issue right now--no lawsuit, no perjury charges, no possibility of impeachment. But Hillary wouldn't let him settle. She let Bill dig his own hole deeper and deeper.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And last January, when Monica announced that she would testify to having an affair with the president, Hillary asked Bill whether it was true.  Bill said, \"Of course not, honey.\"  Hillary then insisted that Bill tell that to the nation--\"I believe in you, dear!\"  Bill give a very angry and negative speech: \"Listen to me.  I never had a sexual relationship with that woman.\" And after his grand jury testimony, when he finally had to cop to getting sucked off by Monica, we know that he wanted to give a very apologetic and weepy speech, but Hillary strongly advised against it.  She told him to attack Starr and the $40 million.  She set herself up to be the marter--the poor, loving, gullible wife protecting her husband.", "input": "", "output": "Are you..."}, {"instruction": "Just one more minute. Basically, Hillary set Bill up. If anything goes down now, she will be remembered as the innocent one and Bill will be the lying sex monster who couldn't keep it in his pants. I've heard that she's receiving bigger offers for her book than either Bill or Monica is.", "input": "", "output": "I see your point..."}, {"instruction": "She's young, and she has places to go. Bill...well, we'll see how history will make him out to be, but their fates are no longer closely intertwined. After he's out of office, she'll probably quietly divorce him.  Oh, and remember that story the White House tried to float through Dick Morris about Hillary being a lesbian? I bet she didn't like that at all.", "input": "", "output": "Let's get back to our session, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Oh, and we are seeding this story out through the Internet.  We're interested to see if our Hillary conspiracy theory--which we admit is speculative fiction--gets adopted and becomes popular.", "input": "", "output": "You're spreading your story via the Internet?"}, {"instruction": "We have our ways, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "That's a bit frightening."}, {"instruction": "You don't know the half of it, Doctor. And Lloyd is totally into this, too.", "input": "", "output": "Lloyd Major, the CEO?"}, {"instruction": "He's been hanging around with us for our HC Meetings--Hillary Conspiracy.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you're doing such important work in your new department."}, {"instruction": "We work very hard, Doctor, but we play, too.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So how has it been working out with Martin? You work together, and is he still staying in your house?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's been okay to work together. And it's been nice to have someone taking care of me while I was sick. He was very good about that. It's strange.", "input": "", "output": "What is?"}, {"instruction": "It's so easy to fall into old patterns of behavior.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I keep catching myself acting like I used to act when we were together. We're not having sex or anything, don't worry, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "That's good."}, {"instruction": "But I find myself snuggling close to him while we watch the television. I fell asleep on his lap a few times. And when I woke up, there were a few moments when I forgot that we were not together like that anymore, and I...well, you get the idea.", "input": "", "output": "I do. And how does Martin feel about living with you?"}, {"instruction": "He feels very strongly that he is responsible for everything that happened.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And he said that he will stay and protect me as long as necessary.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And how is the investigation going? Did they find Kathy yet?"}, {"instruction": "No. There is no trace of her. Martin has been going to our S&M club events regularly, and no one has heard anything about Kathy there either.", "input": "", "output": "So Martin still..."}, {"instruction": "Sure, he never gave it up. I encourage him to pursue his sexuality. He is not hurting anyone, literally. And I would rather not live with a sexually frustrated foot fetisher, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah..."}, {"instruction": "At least one of us is getting it on regular basis. It's been a very long time since I've seen any action.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Caren and Greg...remember them?", "input": "", "output": "I do."}, {"instruction": "They're having a baby. She's not really showing yet, but she's been puking her guts out every day at the office, so I hear.", "input": "", "output": "Do you talk to them much?"}, {"instruction": "I guess we've really drifted apart in the last year. They have each other, and now, they have the baby. And they don't really understand me anymore.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I like the people in my department. They are a lot less judgmental. They've sort of adopted this hedonistic philosophy--anything goes as long as it brings pleasure and doesn't hurt anyone.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's much better that way. The people from my old programming department were so repressed by comparison. All those porno flicks that we used to watch...it was all because they really didn't have any sex in their real lives. People who actually get to do it and to experiment, they don't need as much of that kind of stimulation.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And what do you mean by doing it and experimentation?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's...it covers a lot of ground, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Can you give me a for instance?"}, {"instruction": "Well, they told me about Sylvia Bows. She was an SII executive who got the company's medical records and did it with all the men that had good genetics and that were HIV negative. She did it with a few people from my department as well. She had sex to get pregnant and to get back at her husband for having a secret vasectomy. I think that was cool. And no one really got hurt. I was told she was very good in bed, too.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So you approve?"}, {"instruction": "I do. And everyone is cool about my experimentations with S&M. They don't think I'm somehow perverted because I enjoy it. That's very refreshing. I can talk to these people about how it feels like and what I like, and they act interested and supportive--not at all like the guys from programming.", "input": "", "output": "How was that?"}, {"instruction": "They thought I was a freak.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So you talk about sex with your current office mates?"}, {"instruction": "Sex is very important. And there's nothing wrong with it. We all think it's healthy to talk about sex, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "I believe sex is a good topic of conversation, but perhaps not at work. That can set up some very uncomfortable situations. Don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "It can. It sure did in the programming department. But not with these people.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "They're different. Maybe it's because they're smarter then most.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Well, we're out of time for today, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I see that. I should be getting back to work anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Work?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we have a little field trip planned for this evening.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure you'd understand.", "input": "", "output": "Try me."}, {"instruction": "Well, there's this place in Oakland--the Edgewater Motel.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not going to like this."}, {"instruction": "It's sort of a voyeur place--people keep their window shades up.  You do it, they watch; they do it, you watch.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Don't growl, Doctor. I'm not going alone. And I don't really want to do anything...well, not the first time, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Anna, you always manage to come up..."}, {"instruction": "Don't freak out, it's cool. I'm a big girl, Doctor.  And I like to watch.  See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Aren't you going to wish me a good time?", "input": "", "output": "Don't get hurt."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. Please, sit down."}, {"instruction": "I'd be happy to, Doctor. I've been feeling like shit again.", "input": "", "output": "Sick?"}, {"instruction": "I somehow managed to get a sinus infection. I've been on antibiotics for four days now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Anna.  You do seem to get sick an awful lot."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well...", "input": "", "output": "Are you sleeping any better?"}, {"instruction": "I still have problems breathing when I'm horizontal, so...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I've never met anyone more understanding about a sinus infection than Lloyd, the CEO.  The man is an angel--he sent me home and told me that a sinus infection guarantees paid sick leave around SII.  Can you believe that?", "input": "", "output": "Well, actually..."}, {"instruction": "So I was home Monday and Tuesday.  That was nice. I've been working a lot lately and I haven't had much opportunity to wallow in bed.  So I got to watch tons of bad afternoon TV.  But it did get boring, so I'm back at work.", "input": "", "output": "I see. How did your little company field trip go last week?"}, {"instruction": "Do you mean the Edgewater Adult Resort?", "input": "", "output": "How was it?"}, {"instruction": "It had its moments.", "input": "", "output": "Can you be a bit more specific?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it was a bit different than what we had imagined.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "It was more oriented towards couples than  I thought it would be.  There were some striptease shows downstairs. There was a full bar. And the show girls interacted with the audience between their performances.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "I guess that's all very typical.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "The weird part was going around the hotel in a group, watching couples doing it. I'm sure some of it was staged.  But there were regular people who just got off on being watched.", "input": "", "output": "How were you able to see..."}, {"instruction": "Some places, there were one way mirrors.  The people on the other side knew they were being seen but they didn't know by whom and when.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, we could just look through an open door.  That was a bit uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "There was a mob of us just outside the door.  And we were pushing and looking over each other's shoulders.  It was very strange.  It wasn't very erotic for me.  It didn't feel like we were looking in, it was more...I don't know.  It wasn't like real voyeurism.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Then there was the garden area.  There was a pool and a hot spa.  Some people were having sex by the pool.  And there were some pretty naked girls wondering about--they were part of the staff.  There was a lesbian show by the pool, too. It was also staged. Well, I'm pretty sure it was staged.", "input": "", "output": "Did this make you feel uncomfortable?"}, {"instruction": "No, it was fine.  It was much better then the open door deal.  Oh, and all the curtains were up on the windows.  We could look into the rooms and see what people were doing there.  That felt more like real voyeurism to me.  There were guests who kept their windows open, and there were performers who did a strip act in front of open windows.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "We were all consenting adults, Doctor.  It never felt wrong.  There were things that felt awkward, but not wrong.", "input": "", "output": "So overall..."}, {"instruction": "I'm glad that place exists.  It clearly serves its purpose, just like S&M clubs serve theirs.", "input": "", "output": "I agree."}, {"instruction": "But it wasn't right the way we went.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "It was specifically geared for couples.  A large group like ours was welcome, but the place wasn't set up to accommodate us.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "The place was all about participation.  And, as a group, we couldn't do that.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "We watched, but we didn't do much more than that. If I ever go back there again, it would be with a lover.", "input": "", "output": "So you found it erotic?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. We all did.  Martin kept talking about the place all the way home.  He thinks there's a lot of money in setting up a place like that but with an S&M touch.  I think he might be right.  A lot more people are into watching than doing.", "input": "", "output": "A voyeuristic S&M resort?"}, {"instruction": "Don't you think it would be good?", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps."}, {"instruction": "And with this sinus infection, it's been really difficult. I'm not good at taking antibiotics.  I get a yeast infection right away.", "input": "", "output": "That's very common.  The antibiotic kills the good bacteria along with the bad.  Eat some yogurt."}, {"instruction": "I've heard that works, but I prefer to take this little magic pill that wipes out the yeast infection in a few days.", "input": "", "output": "Whatever works for you, Anna."}, {"instruction": "But it does take a few days.  Well, so much for sex.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Well, intercourse is painful, and oral sex and sinus infections don't go well together--breathing problems, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Who are you having sex with, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "It's Martin, isn't it?"}, {"instruction": "We did it just to take the edge off.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "Don't be angry with me, Doctor Bails.  Really, we are not back together again.  We are just having sex.  It's not a bad idea.  Just listen for a second...", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "I know he's safe--I'm not risking my life to have sex with him.  He knows we are not going to get back together over this.  And this way, I'm not motivated by my body's need to have sex.  I'm free to look around until I find someone I really like, and not someone who just turns me on because I haven't had sex for over six months.  It's not a bad decision, Doctor.  Really.  Don't look at me like that.  Please?", "input": "", "output": "Anna, you know what I'm going to say.  It's a bad idea.  You're..."}, {"instruction": "We won't do it a lot.  I promise.  We'll just relieve the tension, and that's it.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you're hearing how all of this sounds."}, {"instruction": "I agree, it's not great.  But you understand, right?", "input": "", "output": "No, I think it's a very bad idea.  In fact, I think Martin shouldn't be staying with you.  Are you still worried about being attacked by Kathy's abductor?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Then there is no real reason for Martin to stay with you, is there?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know what's going on with Kathy's investigation.  But that doesn't mean that I'm out of danger.  My dad thinks I'm not.  He thinks the police should be watching my house and protecting me.  But they aren't.  So having Martin around does make me feel safer.", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "Maybe I should go.  We can talk about this next week, after you have a chance to think about it more.  You're just overreacting right now, Doctor.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not overreacting..."}, {"instruction": "See?  I'll see you next week.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Anna?  All right, I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. You look much better today."}, {"instruction": "The antibiotics seemed to have worked well.  I do feel a lot better.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Well, I would like to come back to our conversation..."}, {"instruction": "Do we really have to, Doctor? I've really have heard enough already.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, you really didn't give me a chance to fully express my..."}, {"instruction": "Actually, it's not really an issue any more.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean? Are you having sex with Martin or not?"}, {"instruction": "I was. But we got to do it for just a few days before...it's really an ugly story, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, I'm listening."}, {"instruction": "I thought you'd feel that way. Well, you'll be happy to know that Martin has moved out of my house.", "input": "", "output": "Really?  And why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently, my dad was so worried about me that he hired a detective to watch the house--\"Just in case,\" as he put it. Well, the guy didn't see anything more suspicious than Martin. But he did report him to my dad.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I thought your dad knew all about Martin living with you?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "You told me specifically that your dad thought having Martin around for protection was okay with him. Was it really? Did you ever tell your dad about Martin moving in with you?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it was my dad's idea that I shouldn't live alone.", "input": "", "output": "That's not the same as approving of Martin moving in with you."}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Anna."}, {"instruction": "See? This is your reaction. My dad's reaction would have been just awful. So why should I get into all the sordid details with him? As it is, he thinks it's all Martin's fault.  All of it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I know you agree with him. But it worked out pretty well.  I did feel safer with Martin around.  And nothing really happened.", "input": "", "output": "Martin just lived with you for a few weeks, and you had sex together."}, {"instruction": "And that's it. End of story.  We are not seeing each other again. I promise you, Doctor.  I don't even think Martin is right for me.", "input": "", "output": "So your dad didn't take the news well?"}, {"instruction": "No.  He surprised us.  He drove down to San Francisco last Friday night and caught us at home together.  No, we weren't having sex.  We were just watching TV and eating a late dinner.  But my dad...you'd think that eating and watching TV was a carnal sin.", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "Don't say it, Doctor.  I've heard it all.  The good news is that the detective guy didn't really see anything suspicious in all the time he had been watching the house.  So I feel a lot safer now, even without Martin.", "input": "", "output": "So Martin is no longer staying with you?"}, {"instruction": "He's back in his old apartment. My dad stayed with me the whole weekend just to be sure.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I've talked with Martin. We both know that ultimately it's for the best.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when we lived together, there really wasn't that much incentive to go and seek someone else.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Now, we can try. Maybe we'll find...I would like to have someone, Doctor. I'm tired.", "input": "", "output": "Tired?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I don't want to fight with my parents or my friends. I don't want to have you be disappointed with me...", "input": "", "output": "I'm..."}, {"instruction": "Sure you are. I counted. This is our ninety-fifth session together, not counting our telephone conversations. I know you pretty well by now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So I don't want to have you disapprove of me. And I don't want to keep catching myself from slipping into a real relationship with Martin. Oh, we'll still be friends, I think. I'm not threatened by him anymore...", "input": "", "output": "Were you ever?"}, {"instruction": "And I'm over the hurt. And I'm no longer embarrassed by all the things that happened between Martin and me.", "input": "", "output": "Were you embarrassed?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't handle that relationship very well.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So I think we can be friends. We have to be.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "We have to work together pretty closely.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't know that."}, {"instruction": "Well...so...", "input": "", "output": "I'm a little surprised by you today, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Really?", "input": "", "output": "This is not the reaction I would have predicted for you after your father found out about you and Martin living together in secret from him."}, {"instruction": "Good.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I mean it's good. I would hate to be your most predictable patient.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, I think I better go now.", "input": "", "output": "We still have a lot of time, Anna. And I think we might find something to talk about. For example, are you..."}, {"instruction": "No, really. I think I'm getting tired. Don't you want me to get some extra sleep?", "input": "", "output": "I do. But I'm getting a feeling that today's session was staged for my benefit."}, {"instruction": "Really?  And what makes you think that?", "input": "", "output": "Was it?"}, {"instruction": "No. I do admit to having thought about our session, but nothing more than that. Don't you think about our sessions sometimes? Don't you try to get ready for me?", "input": "", "output": "Were you trying to get ready for our session today?"}, {"instruction": "I told you what happened. It's the truth. My dad now knows everything...well, almost.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Martin is gone.  And I'm free to pursue other relationships.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So you're doing a very fine job with me, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And I'm tired, and I think if I take off a few minutes early today...well, what's the harm? Really, Doctor, I'll see you next week. We can talk about your fears then. Okay? Please?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "All right. We can end the session early today. But we will continue this conversation next time. I'm..."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. What happened to you last week?"}, {"instruction": "Work.  I'm sorry, I'll try to be better about our appointments.", "input": "", "output": "All right..."}, {"instruction": "And...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I kind of have plans for tonight.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the Exotic Neurotic...I mean the Exotic Erotic Ball is tonight.", "input": "", "output": "Halloween is not until next week..."}, {"instruction": "Yes, well, they have it early.", "input": "", "output": "And you're going?"}, {"instruction": "Yes?", "input": "", "output": "Why are you being so cagey about it?  Who else is going?"}, {"instruction": "It will just be Martin and I.  We'll go as spectators.  We won't do anything too outrageous.  In fact, we'll be the most boring...hmm, the most boring friends to go.", "input": "", "output": "Friends?"}, {"instruction": "We are not going as a couple.  We are just going together.  For safety.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So I need to live a few minutes early, so I have a chance to get ready.", "input": "", "output": "You're going in costume?"}, {"instruction": "It's just something simple that Martin pulled together for me.  I think it's mostly paper and his art work.  It's not at all revealing.  It's just fun.", "input": "", "output": "Have you seen it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not really.  But Martin has been making it for me for about a week, and he has described it in quite some detail.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It should be lovely.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds cold. Well, don't get sick again."}, {"instruction": "I won't.  I got these polar...polartex? Whatever. I got these new fabric tights and sweater.  They're black and they'll be perfect under a paper costume.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So how are your parents, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "Please, don't put me in a bad mood just before a party, Doctor.  I want to have fun. I really do.", "input": "", "output": "You're still angry with your dad for getting a detective to watch you?"}, {"instruction": "Even more so now. He went ahead and told my mom everything.  Everything! Can you believe that?", "input": "", "output": "Well, actually..."}, {"instruction": "He specifically promised me that he'd keep my mother out of this.  And now she knows.  She called me last weekend in tears.  My dad insists that she figured it all out herself and that she knew everything all along.  But my mother is just not such a good actress.  He must have spilled the beans.  I told him, from now on, I'm going to have problems trusting him--he just put a rift into our relationship.  And it's for no reason.  Martin and I are not living together anymore.  Kathy's gone.  The investigation...I don't even know what's going on there--no one has contacted me for over a month.  They're no longer interested in me.  I guess they finally figured that I'm of absolute no use to them.  So my life has been as normal as anyone's.  There was no reason to make my mom so freaked.", "input": "", "output": "Just calm down, Anna. That was a big secret to keep from your mother..."}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Well, it's rare that a couple keeps secrets from each other for long, especially about their children.  Don't be too hard on your dad.  He's just worried about you."}, {"instruction": "I know. But now I have to make a special trip up to Davis just to have this conversation with my mom. And I can tell you just how much I'm looking forward to that.", "input": "", "output": "I think I can imagine."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "So how does it feel to live by yourself again? Are you as worried about being alone in the house as you thought you would be?"}, {"instruction": "It's not as bad as I thought.  But I work a lot, so...it's a bit lonely.   There is a show on HBO, \"Sex and the City.\" It's about four women friends living in New York City, and how they cope with being single in their thirties.  It's sad and funny at the same time.  I see myself there.  I'll be thirty soon.  I'm fairly successful at what I do.  And my needs in a relationship have definitely changed.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "It was different when I was just twenty-two.  There were different expectations placed on me, and I had different needs then.  I want a lot more from my partner now.  I feel like I have to make a snap judgment on whether a man is a prospective husband or just a nighttime diversion.  There doesn't seem as much time to just be with someone now.  I feel the pressure.  If he's not a prospect, I have to move on, no matter how much fun we might be having.", "input": "", "output": "Where do you feel this pressure coming from?"}, {"instruction": "There was always some pressure from my parents.  But now that's more intense.  They're more worried that I will be left alone, or that I will settle for someone who's just not...well, who's not as good as I should have.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Is it just your parents..."}, {"instruction": "No.  It's everywhere.  There's pressure in the office, \"Are you seeing anyone? Is he the one?\"  There's this sense I no longer can afford to waste my time on men who are just...I feel like I can't have fun with a man anymore.  He's it, or he's out.  There's no middle ground when you're a woman approaching her thirties.  I think it's strange.  And it's not just my friends.  I find myself feeling that way, too.  I'll have a short meaningless conversation with a guy at Starbucks, and I'm already thinking: \"Is he someone I'd be interested in spending my life with?\"  If not, why waste the time and effort?  Crazy, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to be married?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I do.  I want to have a life partner with whom I can share my whole life.  It sounds so corny when I say it out loud, but I really want to have someone that close to me, someone I could love with complete abandon, someone I could talk to and share my dreams with. I do feel so lonely, Doctor. And I feel like if I continue to feel this way, I have no chance at finding someone right for me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "It's like the more desperate you feel, the less likely you'll find...it's like I'm jinxing it by wanting it too much.", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  It's fairly common actually..."}, {"instruction": "Sure it is.  I bet you feel it, although it's better for men.  Men tend to get better looking and more interesting with age.  Women just get older.", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "I found my first gray hair the other day...", "input": "", "output": "Is that what this is about?  One gray hair doesn't make you old, Anna.  And I personally think you're more interesting now then when I first saw you over two years ago.  You've matured.  And you've gained character..."}, {"instruction": "You're just trying to make me feel good.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but what I've just said is true. I've seen that HBO show, and I find those women more interesting than the twenty-somethings that I see around SII."}, {"instruction": "God, now I'm one of the old crowd at SII!  I used to be the hip twenty-something.", "input": "", "output": "You're still the hip twenty-something, Anna..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...", "input": "", "output": "Except you have more stock options, more responsibility, and more opportunities to work on better and more interesting projects.  Isn't that right?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I do love my job now.  And I do make enough money that I don't have to worry about paying my rent or buying stuff that I want, even if frivolous.  And I do have quite a sizable chunk of assets thanks to the \"SII Mole\" and the investment plan by Katherine Lippard.  I got a letter from her and it made my day.  You must have gotten a similar letter.  Did you?", "input": "", "output": "See?  Your life is better now than when you were fresh out of college.  And now that you're pulling yourself out of the..."}, {"instruction": "S&M thing?", "input": "", "output": "Are you sorry that you've closed that chapter in your life?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's not closed.  It's just put away for the time being.  If I find the man, I want him to...I want to play games that make me feel...I want that. I like to be...", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  But I think what you want is more in the domain of sex games and not the S&M lifestyle that you experienced before with Martin and Kathy. Right?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I want to go to the Halloween party at the S&M club. Do you think that's wrong?", "input": "", "output": "Why do you want to go?"}, {"instruction": "It turns me on.  And I think it will be more fun and games and less intense than usual.  I think there will be people there who are just doing it for fun.  And I feel like there'll be less pressure on me to perform.  So...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So I made plans to go with Martin.  And we have an understanding--his job is to make me feel secure, and my job is to secure some action for him.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "In fact, I think I'm late for the ball, Doctor.  I've got to go.  I haven't even had a fitting for my costume yet.  Martin must be mad at me by now.", "input": "", "output": "All right.  Take care of yourself. Don't get into any trouble."}, {"instruction": "I won't.  I love you, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Anna?"}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor. Are you better? You were sick, weren't you? You weren't just playing hooky because it was Halloween, right?", "input": "", "output": "I was sick, Anna. Now, how are you?"}, {"instruction": "You're always quick to change the subject, Doctor. Well, I had a very interesting couple of weeks in fact.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I think we might know where Kathy is.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "Remember I told you that Martin and I were going to go to this S&M party?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Did you see Kathy there?"}, {"instruction": "It's a bit more complicated than that.", "input": "", "output": "I'm listening."}, {"instruction": "Gray was at the party.", "input": "", "output": "You mean the same Gray--the whip master who took advantage of you when you were trying to find out what it felt like to be submissive?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, him.  I haven't seen him in a long time. I think he got into some real hardcore stuff and was too involved to go to any of the club socials.", "input": "", "output": "But you haven't been going either, right?"}, {"instruction": "That's true. But Martin has, and he hasn't seen him. In fact, since I feel fairly uncomfortable around Gray, I try to avoid him, and I usually leave if I see him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So when we saw him at the party, I wanted to leave right away, but I couldn't--Martin was in the middle of a session, and I had to wait for him. So I tried sitting in the far corner of the dungeon and pretending I didn't see him.", "input": "", "output": "Does Gray try to approach you when...?"}, {"instruction": "It's the way that man looks at me. I can feel his eyes on my body from across the room. I know I must be imagining it, but the times that I turned and looked, he was there, staring straight into my eyes. It was very unnerving. I felt uncomfortable. I got this urge to flee, but I felt frozen, like I...well, you get the picture.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't realize that Gray still has such power over you."}, {"instruction": "There's something about that man...well, to get back to the story, Gray arrived at the party with three people. Two were clearly women, and the other I couldn't really tell--they were all wearing leather face masks and some sort of corsets made out of metal, leather, and rope.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was an S&M Halloween party, so there was nothing usual or unexpected in their attire.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Gray himself wasn't wearing much. He had this device screwed to his cock, and his nipples were in clamps. But other than that, he was basically naked.", "input": "", "output": "I see. I thought nipple clamps and such things were just used by submissives."}, {"instruction": "Look, I don't know.  I'm just telling you how he was dressed.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, and how were you dressed?"}, {"instruction": "I was fairly conservative.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I was conservative for that crowd. I had a leather corset that Martin gave me as a present some time ago, and I was wearing some cuffs on my wrists and ankles. But the cuffs were mostly for decoration and so...", "input": "", "output": "Were you planning on participating in any of the activities?"}, {"instruction": "I was going to look around and see if I liked anything. And if something caught my eye...I wasn't planning on playing hard, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So I was sitting, trying to pretend like I didn't see him, but he knew I was there. He was planning a complicated set up with all of his entourage.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "Somehow, I felt like he was doing it to...I mean I think he was doing it for me.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "It was probably just my imagination. But it was the way he was going about tying up his victims. There was a big cross on one side of the room. Gray took two of his submissives and tied them back to back, spread eagle to the cross. Their eyes and mouths were covered by the masks, and he arranged to have their bodies touching each other whereever possible--whatever one felt, the other could pick up through the skin and body reaction of the first.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Then he took the girl. She was almost completely covered in either leather or ropes wrapped tightly around her body. I knew there was something familiar about her--the way her body moved, her mannerisms. But I couldn't put my finger on who she was. She was wearing a mask but, above that, she was completely bald--her head was shaved.  Actually, her genitals were exposed and they were completely bare too. Gray stood behind her and rubbed himself on her. He was so much taller that she was. His cock just about touched her neck. Gray has an enormous cock, and with all that stuff he had around it...it was frightening. I couldn't take my eyes off of them, and he knew it. I don't understand how that man can have so much power over people...over me.", "input": "", "output": "Your encounter with Gray left a very strong impression on you and influenced your sexuality. I'm not surprised that his presence still affects you so much, although I wish you mentioned this earlier--I think we need to work on that."}, {"instruction": "Hmm, sure. So I was watching Gray cock-whipping the shoulders and face of this little woman, when Martin came over. He was finally done with his playing and came to check on me. He was able to recognize Kathy right away.", "input": "", "output": "The little woman?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't know why I didn't see. It was her body, her movement, but somehow...maybe I just couldn't picture her with Gray. But it was her. Her long hair was gone, and she had put on some weight, but it was definitely her.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Kathy had become Gray's slave.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure? Maybe she was with him just for the party?"}, {"instruction": "No. We asked around. Gray had all but disappeared from the public S&M scene for almost six months. No one had heard from him, and he stopped answering his phone and e-mail. I don't know who the other two with him were, but Kathy's disappearance fits well with her being with him.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "I know she didn't want to live with her Aunt Helen. And she was scared to be by herself and didn't really have many resources to do so.", "input": "", "output": "Kathy had a lot of money saved from her dominatrix business..."}, {"instruction": "Not enough to disappear without a trace. And as far as I know, her bank account hasn't been touched--the cops were watching it. If anyone tried to claim the money from her bank, they would have been picked up by the police immediately.", "input": "", "output": "Is Kathy's case still being investigated?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think they would have just closed it without finding out what happened to her, right?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did you try to approach Kathy at the party?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't have the guts to, and Martin thought that would have been a bad idea.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "What if it was Gray?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "What if it was Gray who attacked her?", "input": "", "output": "He doesn't fit Kathy's description of her attacker."}, {"instruction": "Kathy's lied before.", "input": "", "output": "The hotel staff was also interviewed by the police, wasn't it?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, I thought it was a good idea to leave, too.", "input": "", "output": "I agree, if Gray was making you feel uncomfortable, or if you think he was Kathy's attacker, it's best to leave the investigating to the police. Did you contact the police and tell them that you saw Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "As soon as we got home and changed, we called the detective who used to work on Kathy's case. We told him what we saw.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He wanted to know if we had any evidence other than our perceptions that it was in fact Kathy. We didn't of course. He wanted to know if we knew how to find Gray. We didn't.", "input": "", "output": "Did the detective try going to the party that night and checking out if that woman was Kathy?"}, {"instruction": "They did. Martin and I are now in tons of trouble with our S&M club for telling the police where the party was.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "They didn't arrest anyone, they didn't even really break up the party, although I suspect that everyone left as soon as they could. But when the police got there, Gray and his slaves were gone.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I seems that it should be easy for the police to follow up now and question Gray."}, {"instruction": "The police called us. They wanted us to do some of the investigation for them.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I like that."}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure I like that either, but do we have a choice?", "input": "", "output": "You always have a choice..."}, {"instruction": "Gray knew that I saw him, and he probably knew that we recognized Kathy.", "input": "", "output": "So..."}, {"instruction": "The detectives argued that Gray was dangerous and that it was in our best interest to help them.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What did they ask you to do?"}, {"instruction": "They wanted us to go to all the S&M Halloween events that we knew of and some that they told us about.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but we didn't see Gray or Kathy again.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's not over yet.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, now the police have a clue, and they will try to follow it, I suppose. Hopefully, though, they won't ask any more of Martin and me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. If they do, let me know. I don't think it's in your best interest to come in contact with either Gray or Kathy. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. Well, my time is up.", "input": "", "output": "That's true. Okay, keep me informed and call if you need my help."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, you're foremost in my mind, Charles. Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Not so loud.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm? What's the..."}, {"instruction": "Quieter, please. Lower your voice.", "input": "", "output": "Are you all right?"}, {"instruction": "That's much better, thank you. I have a very bad headache.", "input": "", "output": "Did you take anything for it?"}, {"instruction": "Advil. I took three things of Advil about one hour ago--and at ten this morning and last night at...", "input": "", "output": "Anna, what's going on?"}, {"instruction": "I have a very bad headache.", "input": "", "output": "I got that. Why?"}, {"instruction": "I've been doing some moonlighting for the police, and it's been hard on my head. God, do you mind turning off the lights?", "input": "", "output": "Sure. Are you photophobic?"}, {"instruction": "I guess. The light just kills my eyes. I've been working in a closet all day with my screen brightness turned down to almost nothing.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Why didn't you just go home?"}, {"instruction": "I want at least some appearance of a normal life and some privacy.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And the analgesics are not helping?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.", "input": "", "output": "Are you up for having your session today?"}, {"instruction": "I'm hoping it will get better. And I don't really want to go home--I'm too tired.", "input": "", "output": "Most people prefer being at home when they are not feeling well..."}, {"instruction": "Most people don't have a young, go-getting, overly eager, leather sporting detective living with them.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And when did this happen?"}, {"instruction": "I guess it was Sunday.", "input": "", "output": "You guess?"}, {"instruction": "They weren't able to find Kathy on their own. And for some reason they think I'm just their guy to do it for them, with a little help of Mister Trevor the Terrible.", "input": "", "output": "Trevor being the detective living with you?"}, {"instruction": "They imported him from somewhere East.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And what is it that they want from you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm to play a girlfriend to this Leather Geek. You'd think that the man never touched leather before in his life. Hmm...", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to lie down?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so Trevor is a detective assigned to Kathy's case, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. We're supposed to go around to all these underground S&M clubs in the city--most I've never even heard of--and gather information on Greg and his minions.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So the police believe Kathy is with Greg?"}, {"instruction": "I know she's with him. What the police believe is a total mystery to me; they don't tell me nearly enough for me to do what I do for them.", "input": "", "output": "And what is that? What are they asking you to do?"}, {"instruction": "We are supposed to go around to underground S&M clubs.", "input": "", "output": "You said that."}, {"instruction": "Yes, well...", "input": "", "output": "Can you tell me in a little more detail what it is that the police is asking you to do?"}, {"instruction": "Last week, they contacted my boss to ask for me to get time off so that I could participate in an investigation.", "input": "", "output": "It was nice of them to ask."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. They managed to get Mr. Major involved. Can you believe the nerve? They went to the CEO of a large company to ask for an employee's leave of absences, and they did it without asking me first.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So now everyone knows that I'm doing something undercover for the SFPD.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure it wasn't their intention to spread rumors about..."}, {"instruction": "This is SII we're talking about. We live off rumors. Who has time to have a life outside of the company?", "input": "", "output": "Well, you do."}, {"instruction": "But to a very limited extent.", "input": "", "output": "I guess it's all about how you spend your limited free time..."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "So everyone in your department knows what?"}, {"instruction": "Not much, really. They know that I'll be working on a police investigation regarding the disappearance of my ex-roommate.", "input": "", "output": "They know that much?"}, {"instruction": "I had to tell them something.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And is Martin involved?"}, {"instruction": "He said they didn't ask him to do anything. They just want me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was kind of sweet--Lloyd came in to see me and asked me if I felt up to this or if I would prefer not to get involved.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He was very concerned for my safety. I told him that I wanted to help, and that if I could assist in getting this case closed or resolved, it would ultimately be in my best interest to do so. He was as nice as could be.  He said that I'm a hero for doing this and that he is proud of me.  He was so fatherly about the whole thing, but it was nice.  I felt like I belonged there and that people cared about me.  We ended up going to lunch together--just Lloyd and I. Cool, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Very cool."}, {"instruction": "I sort of ended up telling him the whole story over coffee and eclairs.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Lloyd was interested and very sympathetic. So now I can come and go as I please. I still get to work on our project, but my part is somewhat smaller for awhile, hopefully, not for too long.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So have you done anything yet?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. So far, Trevor and I went to three night clubs...strip clubs...well, they are like a mixture between a strip club and an S&M club.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, people who attend S&M parties are usually regulars. They already know that they are interested in doing this or at least in trying it. And the club events tend to be in people's basements and attics and stuff. The places we've been to are different.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "They are more commercial in nature.", "input": "", "output": "I've always assumed that there were club membership fees and party fees for the S&M clubs that you went to."}, {"instruction": "That's true, although some parties are free--when a couple of friends get together...", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "But these places we went to were set up more like regular strip clubs, and they catered to the curious crowd rather than the hardcore S&M group.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "There's very loud music playing all the time, and there're obnoxious DJs acting as hosts and masters of ceremonies.", "input": "", "output": "That's the origin on your headache?"}, {"instruction": "It's so loud. Thank god, it's illegal to smoke in those places now. I swear, if smoking was allowed, I wouldn't be doing it. That would be the last straw.", "input": "", "output": "So you don't like doing this?"}, {"instruction": "No. Not really. Mostly, I just want it to be over with. I don't even care that much what happens to Kathy anymore. If she wants to be Gray's slave, than leave her the fuck alone. It's her life. If she wants to throw it all away like that, then...I sound cruel, don't I?", "input": "", "output": "No. I think you've been through a lot yourself. I'll be very happy when all of this is behind you. I think you've assisted this investigation quite enough."}, {"instruction": "Me too.", "input": "", "output": "And I think all of this is having an effect on your health."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Do you want to know more about these clubs?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "They are dark with some colored and strobe lights wildly circling the room--another contribution to my splitting headache.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "There are usually two stages: one for the male submissives and female dominants, and one for the female submissives and male dominants. There are some same sex acts sprinkled in between, and there are group acts as well.", "input": "", "output": "Why is there a division?"}, {"instruction": "At a regular party, there are multiple scenes going on at once--there's enough material to satisfy the voyeuristic urges and to inspire creativity. But these places are set up differently. The patrons come mostly to watch the shows, although there are private rooms in the back where there is some customer participation activity going on, but on a limited scale.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "These places are more about making money then about like-minded individuals participating in a...it's not like a group of S&M devotees getting together.", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "The customers get to sit around the stage, drink, watch the show, and shovel over tips. If customers want some action themselves, they can request a submissive or a dominant that they like and go in the back for a very, very short time to do whatever.", "input": "", "output": "Were you asked to participate in that way by the police?"}, {"instruction": "No. My job is to pretend that Trevor is my new dominant partner. One time, I had to sit by his feet, through most of the show. That wasn't fun. But when he wants to talk to someone in the back, Trevor usually leaves me and goes alone. As his submissive, I'm not really required to participate that much.", "input": "", "output": "Have you seen people you know at these places?"}, {"instruction": "I saw three of Kathy's customers.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "This is just another outlet for these people, and it's cheaper than what Kathy was charging.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "There was this one guy in there. He was in a wheelchair, and he had one of those oxygen tank things. He was breathing though the mask, and he had a male nurse accompany him. He was there when we came in, and he was still there when we left two and a half hours later. He sat right by the stage, and the performers came right up to him and let him smell the burned flesh after the brandings...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He was clearly a regular, and it was very disturbing. It was very disturbing for me. I felt dizzy and started seeing spots in front of my eyes. Trevor literally had to carry me out of there. But no one cared. It was as if this was normal.", "input": "", "output": "When was this?"}, {"instruction": "Tuesday night. I've had a headache ever since.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And how many times a week do they expect you to do this?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. We did three this week. I'm getting really tired, is it that time yet?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it is. I'm sorry. Go home, Anna. Take care of yourself. And if this is too much for you, you know that you can always say no."}, {"instruction": "Right. I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Goodbye, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You look a bit flushed."}, {"instruction": "I ran. I thought I was late.", "input": "", "output": "No, right on time. So, tell me about your Thanksgiving."}, {"instruction": "It was very nice. I got there okay. My parents were happy to see me.", "input": "", "output": "How are they?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my mom knows everything.", "input": "", "output": "Everything?"}, {"instruction": "As much as my dad.  Trevor called my parents' house on Saturday morning. I was still there. He talked with my dad first, I had no idea it was him.", "input": "", "output": "He called your parents' house? Why?"}, {"instruction": "He wanted to apologize to me again. He got their number out of my SFPD file.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "He charmed my mom and dad.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "He called and asked my dad's permission to stop by and talk with them and me in person.", "input": "", "output": "He actually came to your parents' house?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he asked first.", "input": "", "output": "Still..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, if he had gotten me, I would have said no. But my dad was more than happy to talk with him and to meet him. My dad really gets off on having me be part of a police investigation.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So Trevor came. My mom made tea. My dad and I had to fill her in on as much as we could before he showed up, which was fifteen minutes after his call, by the way.", "input": "", "output": "So he was in the area?"}, {"instruction": "I guess.", "input": "", "output": "Did he just happen to be near by?"}, {"instruction": "I was afraid to ask.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I got the impression that it was his intention to see my parents and me and that he would have driven up from San Francisco just to do that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So, any way, we all had some tea and left-over desert, and we talked. And we talked, and we talked.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was the first time I saw him in a more or less normal situation. Before, it was always in some S&M club or somebody's dungeon. And even though we talked about the investigation, Trevor managed to keep it rather clean. He never gave out any sexually explicit details, he never said anything that would have shocked my mother.", "input": "", "output": "But the investigation is very..."}, {"instruction": "He talked about teenage runaways, and how they can get into trouble in a big city. He talked about bad people and sexual predators. But he never said what was actually happening to these kids. My mother knew, because we talked about it between ourselves just before he came. And my dad...well, you know how much he knew. So Trevor really put on a show for them. He made me out to be a hero--a private citizen doing her best to aid those poor, unfortunate, misguided, and abused children. Even I felt somehow in awe of myself.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I guess it was all a form of manipulation. But at the time, it was nice. My parents are very proud of me now. And that felt good. If I had told the story to my mother, I wouldn't have come off as well as I did. So now she knows. She's a bit scared, but Trevor assured her that he would lay down his life for me.", "input": "", "output": "That's nice."}, {"instruction": "It was. It felt good.", "input": "", "output": "So do you like Trevor more now?"}, {"instruction": "I guess.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you do. And are you willing to work with him again?"}, {"instruction": "We will do a few more outings together.", "input": "", "output": "I see. When?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe one this weekend. He said that he won't take advantage of my good nature to drag me into these scenes any more than is absolutely necessary.", "input": "", "output": "And what is that absolute minimum that he's talking about?"}, {"instruction": "Probably once or twice a week.", "input": "", "output": "That's a lot. Are you sure you want to do this, Anna?"}, {"instruction": "He said that they are very close now.", "input": "", "output": "Close to solving the case?"}, {"instruction": "Close to getting enough evidence to get Gray.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know what the charge against Gray will be?"}, {"instruction": "I think it will be something about having sex with a minor and exploiting underage kids in the S&M shows and demonstrations. I'm sure there is more to it than this, but I think that's what they basically want him for. They said that when Kathy first ran away from home, Gray was the one who got her into the whole S&M thing. They said that he finds kids living on the streets and gives them a home and...you know.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "They think he has a few runways living with him right now.", "input": "", "output": "Would you have to testify?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I don't really know anything. I didn't know Kathy when she was underage, and what she told me about her life as a teenager could be a complete fabrication. Plus, she never told me about Gray. When she first introduced me to him, I had no idea she had anything more than a casual connection to him.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's all history now. Let me tell you about my work, Doctor, it's a far better subject.", "input": "", "output": "All right. What's going on at work?"}, {"instruction": "I love working in my department. Did you know that Lloyd is going to the 1998 Nobel Prize awards ceremony in Sweden? He said that this year's Physics Prize winner is a buddy of his. Have you ever heard of Robert Laughlin?", "input": "", "output": "No, I've never heard of him."}, {"instruction": "Well, he is only getting a Nobel Prize in Physics, why would you?", "input": "", "output": "And Lloyd is a friend of his?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Very cool. This guy will visit with us in the next few months. He hypothesized that electrons in a powerful electric field condense into this liquid made up of quasi particles with fractional electron charge. Well, this can mean some interesting new technology--things will get a lot smaller soon. Cell phones, chips...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Don't worry, I don't get much of it myself yet, but I will. In our department, they encourage continuing education and specialization in a scientific field of choice. I chose physics. So I get to take graduate classes over at UCB, and I also get to go to any three scientific conferences a year, anywhere in the world. Cool?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "It's great! I'm very happy, Doctor. I really like my job. I like that they encourage me to think of the most incredible ideas and see if they could be brought to life. You should attend one of our weekly brainstorming-slash-presentation meetings--you'll either quit your job and join our team, or you'll dedicate half your time to group therapy sessions for SII's grandest band of lunatics.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you call yourselves?"}, {"instruction": "No. I was just joking with Trevor on the phone about what it is that we do in my department, and that's what he called us--that's why I was almost late to see you today.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you talk with Trevor a lot on the phone?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. Once a day maybe. He usually calls me once a day.", "input": "", "output": "Usually?"}, {"instruction": "Well, since the post Thanksgiving Saturday.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "He is a much nicer guy than he let on, Doctor. And he is interested in what I do--he is trying to be very careful that I don't miss any of the time I need at work. He's trying. I think he even got in trouble with his boss because of me.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't want to miss Lloyd's presentation on Monday, so Trevor let me skip one of those S&M Winter Wonderland Specials.", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "Some party, I don't really know. I told Trevor I couldn't...I didn't want to go, and he was fine with that. I heard later that he got into trouble over that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, our time is up. I'll see you next week, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, that's good. Anna?"}, {"instruction": "Yes?", "input": "", "output": "You seemed almost giddy today. Is there something you did tell me?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know what you're talking about, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Oh, by the way, I was looking back in my notes and I saw that it'll be our hundredth session next week."}, {"instruction": "Really? Well, we should do something to celebrate.", "input": "", "output": "We'll see. Have a nice week, Anna."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. Come in. What's all this?"}, {"instruction": "Let's see. This is a chocolate cake. These are balloons. And this is champagne. You do like champagne, don't you, Charles?", "input": "", "output": "I...why?"}, {"instruction": "I know you've been gone for quite some time, but you must have remembered that this is our hundredth session together?", "input": "", "output": "I was going to mention that..."}, {"instruction": "I want more than just a mention, I want to celebrate. Here, drink up. I don't really like champagne, but the store said that it was good. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "It's good, thank you, Anna. You seem..."}, {"instruction": "And here's a piece of cake...", "input": "", "output": "You brought plates?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't think you had any lying around this office.", "input": "", "output": "No, I don't..."}, {"instruction": "Good, isn't it? I do do cakes, and this is my favorite. They call it a \"Better Than Sex\" cake. What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm..."}, {"instruction": "Personally, I think the name is an exaggeration...", "input": "", "output": "Anna, you seem very frenetic. You're talking..."}, {"instruction": "One hundred sessions--don't you think it's a milestone in any relationship?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I see you're done with your cake, shall we start this momentous session?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, if you insist. So, how was your trip?", "input": "", "output": "It was fine, thank you."}, {"instruction": "How is your dad?", "input": "", "output": "He is fine...well..."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, Charles. Was it really bad?", "input": "", "output": "It's just that it was..."}, {"instruction": "Hard?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "There was a time when I thought that if anything ever happened with my dad, I would just...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Well, somehow, I didn't feel that way about my mom. And I've always felt guilty about that--my dad's death would devastate me, but my mom's...it's awful, isn't it, that I should feel different about my mom?", "input": "", "output": "You have a stronger bond with your dad. His death would have more of an effect on you..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Is that how you feel about your dad?", "input": "", "output": "I would rather talk about you, Anna."}, {"instruction": "I know. But I saw your face...", "input": "", "output": "I find it very hard to come to terms with what's happened to my father. But please, let's just..."}, {"instruction": "I think it would be harder to have my dad ill than to just have him die...well, maybe not. But I still remember when I first realized that my dad wasn't a powerful giant capable of moving the world for me anymore.", "input": "", "output": "How old were you?"}, {"instruction": "It must have been around the time I turned fifteen. I was always a very small kid. In Junior High School, I was even shorter than the boys in my class. All the other girls were so much taller...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "My dad made me feel safe, protected. He was always very smart. I could ask him any question, and he would always have an answer for me.", "input": "", "output": "What happened when you turned fifteen?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, nothing. I just went through a growth spurt, and suddenly, I was taller than him. It was strange...", "input": "", "output": "Did that bother you?"}, {"instruction": "One day I just sort of noticed being taller than him. And then I started reading the same books. And somehow, he just stopped being a giant.", "input": "", "output": "How did that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I felt like I lost something...something very important.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But my dad is still strong, smart, and very healthy.", "input": "", "output": "That's good."}, {"instruction": "I'm gradually watching my parents age, get weaker, get older. But it's very gradual. I have this feeling that my dad has always looked the way he does now. But when I look at the old photographs, I can see the aging. I don't like that.", "input": "", "output": "Everyone gets older..."}, {"instruction": "For me, this process is very gradual. But for you...", "input": "", "output": "Anna, I..."}, {"instruction": "I'm talking about me, Doctor. For me...if my dad had a stroke and lost his vitality in such a sudden manner and so completely...", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "I can see in your face just how hard that must be. Is it harder than just losing him all at once?", "input": "", "output": "Do you mean death?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Death just happens, and then it's done with. Then you don't have to watch your dad get...", "input": "", "output": "This is a very painful subject for me right now, Anna. I would prefer that we explore your feelings on this subject some other time. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...", "input": "", "output": "It's all right. Let's just move on. Tell me about your vacation. You told me that you were planning on going to Lake Tahoe with your friends. How was that?"}, {"instruction": "It was very nice. But I didn't go with my friends.", "input": "", "output": "You went alone?"}, {"instruction": "No. I went with a friend.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I went with Trevor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you want to tell me about that?"}, {"instruction": "I do.", "input": "", "output": "Did you go as friends or as lovers?"}, {"instruction": "As both--friends and lovers. I think I really like him, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "He's different somehow from the other men I've been with.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "He is very kind to me. We have a very good time together. We had a wonderful time in Lake Tahoe...well, for a part of it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I'm happy to hear you had a good time."}, {"instruction": "He listens to me. He tries to understand my needs even when I have a hard time understanding them myself.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And Trevor is very different from me. This is the first time I have a boyfriend that has a job so extremely different from mine.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "There's just one little problem.", "input": "", "output": "Yes? What is it?"}, {"instruction": "He's sort of married. Before you say anything, he is not in love with his wife, and they will be separated soon.", "input": "", "output": "Soon?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't know that he was married when we went to Lake Tahoe. I would have told you if I did.", "input": "", "output": "Trevor revealed his marital status only then?"}, {"instruction": "I've never even suspected he had a wife. We always went out together at such extreme times, and...", "input": "", "output": "As a police officer, Trevor always had a built-in excuse."}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "So Trevor is still living with his wife?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but not for long. He said that he never expected to fall in love with me. It just happened.", "input": "", "output": "Trevor told you that he was in love with you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. He said that it took him a long time to realize it. He told me that he tried very hard to remain professional.", "input": "", "output": "Professional?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I know it was a bit hard given what we were doing.", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "I feel if we just met in some other, normal way...", "input": "", "output": "Instead of hanging out in S&M clubs?"}, {"instruction": "God, I dread the day we will have to explain how we met to our children.", "input": "", "output": "Your children? Are you talking about marriage?"}, {"instruction": "I know it's a bit soon given that he still lives with his wife, but...", "input": "", "output": "Anna, we have got to talk about this relationship..."}, {"instruction": "Look, I can bring him in for your approval. Would you like that?", "input": "", "output": "We might consider a joint session some time in the future, but for now, I just want to spend the time figuring out your feelings and..."}, {"instruction": "I can't really tell you about my feelings.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "It's all so new, so confused.", "input": "", "output": "You went to Lake Tahoe in December."}, {"instruction": "But I was so mad at him then.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "That's when I found out that he was married.  I was so furious with him. I would never have gone if I knew.", "input": "", "output": "So what have made you change your mind about Trevor?"}, {"instruction": "It's not exactly like I have changed it. I believe him when he says that he's in love with me.", "input": "", "output": "Are you in love with him?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure. But I have very strong feelings for him.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Well, as I've said, we have a lot to talk about. But now it's late, we're out of time."}, {"instruction": "I know. You can keep the rest of the bottle--I don't really like it. And keep the cake--maybe you'll think of me...", "input": "", "output": "That won't be a problem. I'll see you next week, Anna. Please take care."}, {"instruction": "I will, thank you. I'll see you next week. And, Doctor, I'm very sorry about your dad.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. Please, come in. So, how are your hands?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, they are fine, you can hardly tell anymore...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. They look fine. Did you actually burn your hands or was it just an excuse..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "Well?"}, {"instruction": "I actually burned my hands. It was the worst burn I've ever had in my entire life, Doctor. Luckily, I'm a fast healer. But all that night, I had to sleep...well, just lie in bed, really, with an ice pack. It was very painful. I'm shocked, shocked, that you would even raise the possibility that I...", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Anna, but I thought it was wise to ask."}, {"instruction": "I forgive you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "But it's true that I would have called and canceled our session last week even if I didn't burn my hands.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I had something to do and...", "input": "", "output": "With Trevor?"}, {"instruction": "No, actually, I have to keep it a secret from him until the very last moment.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So what did you do?"}, {"instruction": "Well, remember all those drawings Martin did of me?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. I still have them in my files."}, {"instruction": "They were good, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "They had some artistic merit."}, {"instruction": "Well, I thought they were good. But, in any case, Martin had been making these really neat sketches for S&M fashion wear.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "He is very creative, and some of his ideas are really new and very cool looking. So he submitted his drawing to this S&M fashion show review board. And last week, he heard back from them--they really liked his stuff.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "The problem was that the show is in two weeks, and they require real samples of the outfits Martin conceived.", "input": "", "output": "That's not much time."}, {"instruction": "No. So I promised Martin that I would go with him to pick out the materials he needs to make all that stuff--he'll have three things in the show. And the only time I have to do this is in the evenings and on the weekends.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So that's why you had to skip our session last week?"}, {"instruction": "I told him no, but Martin begged and begged. He is so stressed over this. So we went to this leather shop and picked out some very cool scraps--Martin's designs don't require a lot of material.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Those guys do their own stuff right there on the premises, and they showed us what we would need to sew the scraps together--what kind of needles to use, what threads work best, and other very helpful hints. And then on Friday, we took off several hours for lunch and went to this giant hobby store on the Peninsula. I'm telling you, if you ever get the urge to do metal forging, or clay sculpting, or needlepoint, I can tell you just where to go now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Don't think I haven't noticed your \"hmms\" today--there are a lot more of them than normal.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "That's not much better. So, we went to this hobby place, and Martin loaded up on tons of stuff. We got a specialized sewing machine that can deal with leather and can even be used to make shoes and stuff. And we got this very cool punch-thing. You can insert spikes and snaps into it, and it punchs a hole through the material and permanently attaches all those things to it.", "input": "", "output": "I get the idea."}, {"instruction": "And then we got glue guns, and welders, and little metal thingies, and tons more leather scraps, and just a ton of very wonderful stuff. My only problem was that with the burns on my hands, I couldn't do as much touching and feeling as I would have liked to do.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry about your hands, Anna."}, {"instruction": "And then Saturday and Sunday, Martin and I spent putting together his designs for the show. I'll be his model.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "I thought that would be fun. I think I have the body to pull it off, don't you, Charles?", "input": "", "output": "I think you'll do fine. So how come you just didn't tell me all this on the phone last week? Why were you so vague?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, that. Well, I don't want Trevor to know about any of this, not just yet.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Trevor gets all weird when it comes to Martin.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I told him that it was stupid to be jealous of Martin, but...", "input": "", "output": "Why is it stupid for Trevor to be jealous of Martin? You were engaged once."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's all over between us. Now, we're just friends. I still think Martin is very smart, and we do have a lot in common.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But Trevor...he is not very reasonable when it comes to my socializing with Martin. I don't know why he gets all stupid about it, when I have to be very understanding when it comes to his wife.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I'm not even allowed to raise the subject of sex between him and his wife as an issue. But Martin and I go somewhere together, and Trevor just explodes with jealousy.", "input": "", "output": "And how do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I think it's stupid, because we don't do anything that Trevor should be jealous about.", "input": "", "output": "I see. But how do you feel about it?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, it makes me feel good that he cares so much.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, I feel like it's too much...way out of proportion.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "And sometimes, I feel like he deserves it.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Imagine just how bad I feel, laying in bed at night, knowing that he is with her. I have a very good imagination. I have these images...they drive me crazy sometimes. And I'm not even allowed to talk about it?", "input": "", "output": "Why does Trevor not want to talk about it?"}, {"instruction": "He said that it just makes it so much more painful for him.", "input": "", "output": "Does he consider how you feel about it?"}, {"instruction": "He said that it won't last much longer, I just have to be patient. It will just be a few more months...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Stop saying that!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, I didn't realize..."}, {"instruction": "You don't realize just how annoying that is sometimes? Well, it's very annoying, so just stop it.", "input": "", "output": "Why doesn't Trevor just leave his wife now? What is he waiting for?"}, {"instruction": "He said that there is a very good reason and that he will tell me when the time comes.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Does he have kids?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. He doesn't have any pictures in his wallet, and his clothes are free of kid-related stuff. Caren and Greg have a little girl, and they constantly pull out little wipes or toys or pacifiers out of their pockets. But Trevor is clean.", "input": "", "output": "Did you search his wallet and clothes?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. And you don't have to tell me it was wrong, I know.", "input": "", "output": "How long do you plan to wait..."}, {"instruction": "God, you're very annoying today. Look, our time is up. I've got to go now. I promised Martin I'd hurry over to his place for a fitting as soon as I'm done here. So I'm out of here. I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Anna. Have a good week."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. How are you today?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Anna. I'm fine, thank you. Please sit down. How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "Kathy called.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Sorry to be so to the point, but I thought you'd like to know about that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What did she say?"}, {"instruction": "I'm still sort of weirded out by it, so let me just tell you about it the long way.", "input": "", "output": "Sure. Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "Well, last week, I spent a lot of time over at Martin's place. He's getting ready for the fashion show, and I've been spending most of my spare time with him, helping out.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So the last few weeks, I've been getting a lot of hang-up calls. At first, it was just a few. I thought it was Trevor--he sometimes feels strange leaving a personal message on my machine.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "He says it's because of the investigation--since I'm no longer involved, he doesn't want there to be any confusion over that. But I believe it's because he doesn't want to leave any hard evidence of our relationship.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Do you think that's because of his wife?"}, {"instruction": "He's been very squirrelly about us lately. Maybe his wife suspects something, I don't really know. I just decided to cool things off a bit and let him feel how uncomfortable that feels.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Trevor hates the idea that I've been spending so much time with Martin. But I hate the idea that he spends so much time with his wife. So we're even.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Does Trevor know what you are doing with Martin?"}, {"instruction": "You mean the S&M fashion show?", "input": "", "output": "Last week, you said that you didn't want to tell Trevor about it."}, {"instruction": "Well, when he started shadowing me, I had to tell him--he was making me insane.", "input": "", "output": "Shadowing you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's the drawback of dating a detective--they have ways of finding out what you're up to. So I told him about the show. And I also told him that there's not much he can do about it. We had a bad fight, didn't talk for three days, and then he came crawling back asking forgiveness. Now I'm officially free to do the show with Martin. And I'm actually enjoying it. It's very creative and very different from what I do the rest of my time. And Martin is turning out to be a good friend. He's much better at that than being a boyfriend or a lover, for that matter.", "input": "", "output": "Is Trevor still jealous of Martin?"}, {"instruction": "He thinks that I should separate myself completely from that world. He believes that Martin is bad for me. But how much worse is my relationship with Martin than my involvement with Trevor--the married man? When I put it to him that way, Trevor just let it go. He tells me that I'm just not patient enough: \"What difference does his marriage really make to our relationship?\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I thought he was kidding when he said that...", "input": "", "output": "Does Trevor still talk of leaving his wife for you?"}, {"instruction": "That's the main idea. But he said that she's been sick. She conveniently ruptured an ovarian cyst or something and had to be rushed to the emergency room. She's okay now, I think, but Trevor says that she's in a lot of pain.", "input": "", "output": "When did that happen?"}, {"instruction": "Recently, I guess. I don't really know. Trevor doesn't want to breach the subject of separation while she's doing the hormone therapy.", "input": "", "output": "What hormone therapy?"}, {"instruction": "His wife is taking progesterone or some such thing. Trevor said that it's making her really mad, like insane.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Trevor described how she freaked out over a spot on his shirt after it came back from the laundry. Apparently, she's not in a good way. So I just have to wait.", "input": "", "output": "You say that with a lot of sarcasm."}, {"instruction": "There's always something, isn't it? And what would have happened if I ruptured a cyst? Would he drop his wife and come to me in a hurry? Somehow, I just don't see it happening that way.", "input": "", "output": "So why don't you break off your relationship with Trevor? At least until he has separated from his wife?"}, {"instruction": "Because when we are together, Doctor, it's very good. When we are together, he makes me feel like everything will work out--life will be beautiful if I just wait a bit. But it's very hard when he's not there...", "input": "", "output": "Anna..."}, {"instruction": "I was going to tell you about Kathy. Are you interested?", "input": "", "output": "Oh, sure. But I would like to come back to your relationship with Trevor..."}, {"instruction": "Well, I was getting all these hang-up calls. And last week, I got a few at work. Finally, Tuesday night, Martin had a meeting, and we decided to take the evening off. When I came home, I had six messages, all hang-ups...well, one was heavy breathing, and than it was a hang-up. It made me very angry, and I was just about to call Trevor and let him have it, when the phone rung. I picked it up and almost started yelling, but it was Kathy. I recognized her voice right away, and it sort of gave me a chill.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Why did she call you?"}, {"instruction": "She said that she's been trying to get in touch with me for months. She knew I was being made to help in her police investigation, and so she didn't think it was a good idea to talk to me right after her disappearance. But ever since the police left me alone, and Trevor removed the bugging device from my phone, she felt it was safe enough to try to call me.", "input": "", "output": "You had a bugging device on your phone?"}, {"instruction": "Just for a month or so. Trevor removed it when we started dating--he didn't think it was a good idea to have our conversations recorded.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How did Kathy know about the bug?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't ask.", "input": "", "output": "Go on, what did Kathy want from you?"}, {"instruction": "She said that she wanted to tell me how sorry she was for all the trouble she caused me. She said that she was very fucked up and needed help and didn't know it. She said that she thought I would understand after reading her letter.", "input": "", "output": "What letter?"}, {"instruction": "That's what I said: \"What letter?\" Apparently, she left a note with her aunt the night she ran away.", "input": "", "output": "So she wasn't abducted."}, {"instruction": "Kathy said that she left a very long letter for me and a note to her aunt with the instructions to give me the letter at the first opportunity.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. They never found the letter or the note..."}, {"instruction": "Kathy thinks--and I agree with her--that her aunt found the note and the letter and then destroyed them. If she'd given the note to the police, they wouldn't have bothered with the investigation, and no one would have been out there looking for Kathy. Kathy is an adult and is free to come and go as she pleases. But if the police thought she was kidnapped, they would mount an investigation.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Well, that would explain the lack of any signs of break-in..."}, {"instruction": "Precisely! Kathy's window was opened from the inside. You know, that whole family is very screwed up.", "input": "", "output": "So Kathy left voluntarily. Did she go to Gray?"}, {"instruction": "He helped her get out. She's living with him as a full-time slave right now. And that's also a problem--she is not really allowed to use the phone. She had to sneak out to a gas station down the street so that her calls wouldn't be reflected on Gray's phone bill.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And is this what Kathy wants?"}, {"instruction": "She said that there is a certain freedom to being a slave.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "She no longer has to worry about making decisions or about making a living. All her necessities of life are completely taken care of by Gray. She said that it feels like this great burden has lifted off her shoulders. She is free of worry, of responsibility. She told me that she knew it would sound just horrible to me, but to her it's real freedom, the kind of freedom she could never get any place else.", "input": "", "output": "But at what price?"}, {"instruction": "She said that she's not doing anything that she wouldn't do if she wasn't with Gray. He keeps her happy and satisfied. She doesn't even have to worry about how she looks any more--that's why when I saw her she was so fat. She eats and fucks as much as she wants. She said that she's completely unused to wearing clothes--she just goes naked all the time, even outside in the yard. When they go to an event, Gray just wraps a blanket around her.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about all of this?"}, {"instruction": "Shocked, sort of. It really freaks me out to think of her living like that. Kathy was a very bright woman. She could have done anything, but she chose not to. I have a very hard time understanding that.", "input": "", "output": "Are you angry with her?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I'm angry with the Kathy I used to know. This woman who called me...well, it's hard for me to think of her as the same person, really. She is so alien to me. I had a number of very bad dreams after I spoke to her. And I'm uncomfortable with having to keep this whole thing a secret from Gray...I mean Trevor...and Gray too, I guess. I don't feel like I'm in a very good situation, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you have to keep Kathy's phone call a secret from Trevor?"}, {"instruction": "I promised I would.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "God, it's late. I have to go, Doctor. Martin is waiting for me outside. I didn't tell him anything either. This is all too strange. I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Call me if you need to talk about this before our next session."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Anna."}]
