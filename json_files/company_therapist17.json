You wouldn't be Mr. Decker Jenkins?"}, {"instruction": "Oh please...please call me Decker. That whole concept of Mister scares the hell out of me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Decker it is then. Why does the concept of the title Mister scare you?"}, {"instruction": "It makes me feel like I should be a dad or something. I mean, not that it's bad to be a dad...I guess, but I guess it makes me feel older than I already am.", "input": "", "output": "You look like a very young man, Decker. How old are you?"}, {"instruction": "I just turned 26 on the 8th of this month. I know, I know...that's not old. You don't need to tell me that, Dr. Balis, I hear it all the time from Karen. It's just that I feel like my life has been happening forever. Karen tells me that time will never end, and that scares me. I mean, come on, everything has a starting point and an ending point. Doesn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Well I suppose that depends on who you talk to. May I ask who Karen is?"}, {"instruction": "Karen is my mother, but please don't let her know that I called her my mother. She gets very upset when I do that. I remember when I was five, I called her mommy. Holy Jesus she had a fit. I didn't understand why--I mean she was my mommy. I had to hide under my bed so she would stop whipping me with her belt. Let me tell you, Doc, I didn't make that mistake too often after that. I'm sorry; I'm getting pretty deep already. I hope you don't mind my calling you Doc. I mean it is a title and all.", "input": "", "output": "You call me whatever makes you comfortable. As far as me telling your mother..."}, {"instruction": "Please, Doctor, call her Karen. Hearing her referred to as \"Mother\" sends a few cold spikes through my back, if you know what I mean. You probably don't, but please--Karen.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Decker. I'll try to refer to her as Karen from here on out, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Thank you. You must think I am a lunatic. I almost didn't come today because I was afraid you would send me to some institution like that place in the movie starring Jack Nicholson...oh what the hell is the name of that movie!", "input": "", "output": "Relax, Decker, it's going to be all right. I won't be sending you to an institution, and the movie is called \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\""}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's it! I'm sorry, Doctor. I guess I have a bit of Karen's temper flowing through my veins. Yeah, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\" What a great movie, but very frightening. I mean, it would have to be terrible to be locked up in some hell-hole where everyone there thinks you are nuts, and you feel like you are perfectly normal. But you can't leave because they won't let you. It would be like a great big game. You playing crazy so that you fit in, but trying to act like you are getting better so they let you go. Because in those places if you act like a normal human being, they think you are even crazier. It doesn't make sense to me. Another thing, how the hell are you supposed to be, quote unquote, normal with all those drugs they pump through your body. Doc, please stop me. I'm doing it again.", "input": "", "output": "What are you doing again?"}, {"instruction": "I'm analyzing things way too much, more than I should, anyway. I've always done that. Looking at things in greater depth than other people. Maybe it goes back to all the times that I spent in my room with nothing to do but think. Karen wouldn't let me have any toys or anything. No television, no books, no radio, nothing but me and my brain to question everything. And it drives me crazy not being able to find the answer to things. I search and search my brain until the answer comes, but I only find myself reaching deeper and deeper, finding more and more things to question. I honestly think I am helping myself go insane.", "input": "", "output": "It's all right to question things. But sometimes you must realize that our minds can't comprehend everything that happens to us."}, {"instruction": "I don't always agree with that. Look at how much of our brain we don't use. There has to be more that we can do. I am obsessed with finding out how to use that part of my mind. I'm rambling, Doctor. I can sit here and discuss this with you, and a million other things, all day long but I'm sure you would get bored nor do you have the time.", "input": "", "output": "We can discuss anything you want, Decker. That's what you're here for. As far as my time goes, we don't have to discuss everything today. We can schedule other appointments."}, {"instruction": "Well, I want to try to stop analyzing everything for right now. I just get on these rampages.", "input": "", "output": "OK. So tell me a little about your father."}, {"instruction": "He doesn't exist. Karen has never mentioned him and I only asked about him once. I had to hide again. I have a picture in my mind of what kind of person he was, but I honestly don't know if I'm even close to being right. I see him as a liar and a cheat. A man that only wanted to get laid and found Karen to do it. He did her and she never saw him again. I was a result of their lust. And obviously not wanted by Karen. He is the only thing I try not to find an answer to.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Because it's easier not to know.", "input": "", "output": "Well, don't you think that you could apply that theory to everything else you question?"}, {"instruction": "That is very good, Doctor. I never really thought about that. I may have to try that when I go crazy with analyzing things. I guess Simian was right about coming to see you.", "input": "", "output": "Who is Simian?"}, {"instruction": "Did I mention him? Oh man...you are going to send me to an institution after this one.", "input": "", "output": "Come on now, Decker. I am not going to send you to an institution. Let's get that fear out of the way right now. I'm not here to judge you and anything you tell me here, except in the most extreme circumstances, will not leave the confines of this room. My job is to help you with your problems. But I can only do that if you trust that I'm not going to use what I learn through these sessions to injure you.  So do I have your trust, Decker? If you feel you can't trust me, I can refer you to another doctor that you may find more to your liking."}, {"instruction": "No, no, Doctor. I trust you. Simian specifically told me to meet with you. He said you would be the only one that may be able to help. So, if you'll have me, I'd like to keep meeting with you.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine, Decker. Now tell me about Simian."}, {"instruction": "Okay, but this may take a while.", "input": "", "output": "Well you go ahead and start, and if the session ends and you haven't finished, we'll pick it up the next time you come to see me. Sound all right?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, I met Simian when I was 12. Karen was gone that night. I didn't know where she was. It wasn't unusual for her to leave for a couple of days at a time. Not until I was old enough did I realize that she was on one of her screwfests with whoever had caught her eye at the time. Anyway, it was about 12:30 am and there was a knock at the door. I looked out the peephole and saw an old man. He looked to be, in my young estimation, about 100 years old. He was much shorter than I was then and he hunched over. He had only a couple of long hairs flowing out of his head and his face looked like an old catcher's mitt. But he had these mesmerizing green eyes that looked directly at me through the peephole. I instantly felt at peace with him and knew that the old man was too old to do me any physical harm, and I knew that he had no intention of harming me anyway. So I opened the door and he called me by name. He told me that Karen was fine and she would be home in a few hours, but he wanted to talk to me before she returned. I just nodded and he came in and sat--well actually fell--into a chair near a small lamp that cast a shadow over his face. I remember thinking that the shadow made him look much younger and more handsome. His eyes glowed as he told me to come sit down with him and have a chat.", "input": "", "output": "Did this man scare you?"}, {"instruction": "Not at all. As a matter of fact, it was the first time I was able to remember that I was not afraid of something. I had no questions, either. I somehow knew that he would have an answer for any question I asked him. I wasn't able to come up with one. Are you sure you want me to continue? This, I'm afraid, is going to get a little sketchy for you and Simian tells me that you will have many questions.", "input": "", "output": "Well we are beginning to run out of time so if you would like to stop here, we can continue during our next session."}, {"instruction": "That sounds good. There is just so much to tell.", "input": "", "output": "Well, we can get to that. What I want you to do until we meet again is to try and relax a little. I've noticed all this tension coursing through your body. When you begin to ponder, take a couple of deep breaths and try to tell yourself that it's all right not to be able to answer every question you wonder about. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "I'll do my best. It won't be easy.", "input": "", "output": "Just try. When can we meet again?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm a bartender so I have a pretty screwy schedule. It's not even set, so I will have to call and let you know.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine. Here is my card. You can call me for any reason. It's not only for making appointments."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Dr. Balis. Simian told me you would help.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see real soon, Decker. Thank you for coming. Goodbye, Decker, and try to remember to just relax."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Dr. Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Ah...Decker, It's nice to see you. I was wondering if I'd ever hear from you again."}, {"instruction": "Well...I hope it's all right that I came today. My schedule at work allowed me to come back today at 10:00am. I think I'll be able to make it next Thursday at ten and then on every Thursday thereafter...if that's all right?", "input": "", "output": "I think that'll work just fine. Please come in and get comfortable. How have you been this week?"}, {"instruction": "Not too bad, I guess, all things considered.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? Was there a problem?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I've been thinking all week about my mentioning Simian during our first session. I had no intention of ever mentioning his name. It's just I got all wrapped up in whatever delusion I created and...well you know.", "input": "", "output": "Wait. Start from the beginning, Decker. I'm a little lost."}, {"instruction": "I'm afraid if I tell you, you won't be able to trust me, that you'll tell me that you won't be able to help me any longer. You see, I don't talk much to people, at least not about important things. I talk to people at work, but half the time they're too inebriated to realize that they're slurring and slinging their spit all over my counter--the same counter that I just wiped up from the last drunk bastard who just staggered out of there. The point is, you're the only person that I've found in a long time that actually responds in an intelligent way to me. The problem is that when I find someone like you, I start off telling the truth, then I get into this elaborate story that ends up with me or Simian being some alien that's come to melt the brains of all humans. Sounds pretty stupid, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's not the word I would use. I'm still not sure what it is you are trying to tell me. Are you saying that Simian doesn't exist?"}, {"instruction": "No, not at all. He very much exists. It's just that I've never seen him. I just talk to him. That whole description about our first encounter is false. Completely fabricated. I'm sorry, Dr. Balis. It's just...it's just I don't know how to talk to people. I guess I've got to make my life seem more interesting to people than it actually is. I mean, come on! I go to work. I come home. I sit on my bed and wonder about the way the universe works or whatever happens to be on my mind. I may get an hour or two of sleep if I'm lucky, then I repeat it all over again the next day. I have no adventure--nothing to tell people about. I mean what am I supposed to say when someone asks how my weekend went? \"Oh well, I sat on my bed thinking about what would happen if World War Three started and I survived the war.\" People would think I was a total freak. But that might be the truth. So I make up stories to get their attention, then get so deep that I end up making them think I'm a freak anyway. Besides, people don't have anything interesting to say anyway, especially women. Little tramps with their tits staring me in the face, knowing that they would never let me see them...let alone feel them.", "input": "", "output": "Relax Decker...it's okay. We're getting a little ahead of ourselves here. We'll get to all of this later. I want to stay on Simian for awhile. Is that all right?"}, {"instruction": "You mean you're still going to keep me as a patient after lying to you?", "input": "", "output": "Decker, it really doesn't matter that you lied. We just need to figure out why you lied and a way to keep you from doing it again during our sessions.  I'd also like to try to help you communicate better with other people."}, {"instruction": "You truly are a generous man, Dr. Balis. Simian was right; I like you. That's a great compliment. I don't like too many people. Actually, I don't like anyone, now that I think about it. Simian is the only one, and he has been pinching that last nerve for quite some time now. Sometimes I wish he would just shut the fuck up. Oh my God!  I'm so sorry, Dr. Balis. I didn't mean to swear like that. It just comes out sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "That's quite all right, Decker. I even use those words myself every once in a while. Now you said you've never seen Simian? When does he talk to you?"}, {"instruction": "He is always talking to me. When I sit on the bed, he tells me what to think about. When I go to work, he tells me who to serve first and so on. He never shuts up. He even talks to me when I'm here. He tries to tell me what to say. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.", "input": "", "output": "I see. How long has he been with you?"}, {"instruction": "That's funny. Simian just told me you were going to ask that.", "input": "", "output": "What does he say to tell me?"}, {"instruction": "He says to tell you the truth; there can't be any harm in telling the truth at this point. He first talked to me...I would say I was about twelve or thirteen. It's funny, he doesn't talk nearly as much when I'm here. He only has a few comments here and there.", "input": "", "output": "Has he ever asked you to harm yourself or anyone else?"}, {"instruction": "He's telling me to lie. I don't really know how to answer that. I'm going to tell you the truth, Doctor, since I already paid for what happened. Yes he has.", "input": "", "output": "Can you tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when I was eighteen, I worked in a warehouse at a lumber company. I got home from work early because I had stepped on a nail that went entirely through my foot. I wasn't able to work for a week because of that one. Anyway, when I got home, Karen was on the couch with some other woman. They both were completely naked. Freaked my shit out! I was stunned. It also, incidentally, was the first time I had seen a naked women before. Of course I got an erection, which infuriated Karen. By the time I realized what was going on, the other woman was running out of the room and Karen was swinging the belt over her head. The belt wrapped around my head and the buckle caught me under the eye and ripped my face open. The fucking bitch. Oh God! I did it again.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right, Decker. Please continue."}, {"instruction": "Well anyway, I ran to my room and locked the door. As I was sitting there trying to stop the bleeding, Simian told me that I should hit her back. After a couple of hours contemplating that, I limped into the living room and just punched Karen on the chin.", "input": "", "output": "That's pretty drastic. Was she hurt?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah...I broke her jaw. Her mouth was wired shut for two months. I got to spend three months in county. The little whore pressed charges. I was in for assault.", "input": "", "output": "Is that the only time you've been physical with Karen?"}, {"instruction": "Well, with Simian always riding me about not putting up with her, and Karen always riding me about, well everything, it gets very difficult to hold in those hot flashes of anger and hatred. I've slapped her a few times, mostly though it has just been shoving. Nothing as serious as that first time. She still beats on me just as much.", "input": "", "output": "How often would you say you strike Karen?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe once or twice a month. Nothing too drastic.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Decker, it seems to me that if Simian is urging you to hurt Karen, there's a problem."}, {"instruction": "Jesus Christ, Doctor. You're making it sound like I'm a goddamn serial killer or something. I just hit the bitch in self-defense.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not calling you anything, Decker, and I'm not defending Karen. It sounds like she has treated you very badly."}, {"instruction": "That's quite a profound discovery, Dr. Balis. What gave you the impression that I grew up in a stable household in the first fucking place? I haven't told you anything about the shit I've been through. The bitch is lucky she isn't dead. Shit, I'm getting all worked up. I can hardly breathe. Damn. If I keep this shit up, you'll lock me up in some funny farm.", "input": "", "output": "Just try to relax, Decker. I wasn't condemning you, nor was I defending Karen. I'm just listening to you tell me your story. Maybe together we can develop some strategies to help you cope with the anger you feel suffering from Karen's abuse.  And I'd like you to consider trying some medications which I've found to be effective in situations similar to yours."}, {"instruction": "Can you do something to get Simian out of my mind? I mean I love the man dearly, but...damn, just shut up!  Please, for five minutes.  Let me think for a minute. No, I won't relax, old man. I told you that I will not get into that with the Doctor yet.  Because I don't think it's the right time...", "input": "", "output": "Decker, try and breathe in slowly..."}, {"instruction": "I've told you what I would do if you continue to bring up that ridiculous shit again. Don't threaten you? Who's eating my brain? It sure as hell isn't me. Now don't you threaten me, Simian. I can terminate you with just the twitch of a trigger finger. That always gets him to shut up.", "input": "", "output": "Decker? I want you to listen to me right now.  Please take a deep breath and settle down.  I need to be able to talk to you.  That's better.  I know that your life is a little strained right now, but you need to take a deep breath and try to relax. Good."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, Doctor. I have to do that every once in a while to get Simian off my back. He just won't shut up sometimes. I know you are going to throw me into some funny farm at some point. It's inevitable. I try and try to relax myself, but the pressure of Simian riding me--and Karen.... I sometimes want to just pull the trigger, you know, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Decker, I'm going to do my best to help you, but we're going to have to set some ground rules.  First, I can't help you if you are going to try to commit suicide.  I know that you're concerned that I am going to force you into a mental hospital.  I'll only do that without your consent if I think you are an imminent danger to yourself or to others.  So please don't threaten suicide.  Second,  you have a lot of anger towards Karen, mostly, and I want to work with you on ways to cope with that anger.  Third, I am very concerned that Simian is interfering with your ability to think for yourself.  The way to deal with Simian is through medication.  The medication can give you back some control."}, {"instruction": "Dr. Balis, please help me. I'm scared that I will hurt someone or myself.", "input": "", "output": "You've made it to the first step. You've realized that you need some sort of help and I'm willing to provide that. But I need you to help me as well. I need you to follow through with my recommendations. Can you do that for me?"}, {"instruction": "Can I take a few days to think about it? You know me, I've got to work it out in my mind first.", "input": "", "output": "Decker, I'm worried that with Simian interfering, you really won't have an opportunity to think it through for yourself.  You said that being here in this office reduces Simian's influence somewhat, but I've just seen you having to threaten suicide just to be able to think for a minute.  How about you sit here and think here for a bit, while I write you a prescription?"}, {"instruction": "I can't do that, Doctor.  Look, I promise I will think it through. And I will be here on Thursday at this time, next week.", "input": "", "output": "How about I give you a prescription right now.  If you can work it out in your mind before our next session, then get it filled and start taking it as soon as possible.  I'll give you this patient information pamphlet to help you, and the dosage instructions will be on the box, okay?  And remember, I'm available anytime.  If you need anything, you can call my answering service day or night and they'll get a hold of me."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Dr. Balis. I'll be in touch.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Decker, and please don't wait too long on the medication.  I think you'll be very pleased with the results.  I really think that you'll feel a lot better--like a weight has been lifted from your shoulders."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Dr. Balis. How are you doing today?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Decker. I'm not doing too bad. You look like you are in high spirits."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess I am. I feel pretty good today. I've been taking the medication and I don't know if it's doing any good, but maybe it is. I haven't been able to tell yet.", "input": "", "output": "Well Decker, as I told you before, it may take a little while for you to notice any changes. If it makes you feel better, I've noticed some changes in you."}, {"instruction": "You have. Like what?", "input": "", "output": "Well, first of all, I notice that you seem calm, a little...well to be frank, happy. You're looking directly at me, which you haven't done in the past, and you're smiling. I'm glad to see these signs.  It seems to be an improvement over our past sessions."}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I do feel a little...oh, what's the word I'm looking for...refreshed? Yeah, that's it: refreshed.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I feel more alive, I guess. However, I really don't think it's the medication.", "input": "", "output": "Why's that?"}, {"instruction": "Because this happens every once in a while. I feel pretty good about myself for a few days, then I go right back into the weird shit. Simian isn't around as much during the good days. He's still there--I can feel him--but he doesn't talk as much. The past few days, he has let me live my life my way. But I know what will happen when I fall again. Simian will tell me that I can't live with out his guidance, that I'm not capable of controlling my own life, and that I need him to make the right decisions for me.", "input": "", "output": "Does that include harming yourself at times?"}, {"instruction": "Well, not really. He's never told me to go and slit my wrists or anything, if that's what you mean. But he has commented that it wouldn't hurt anything if I no longer existed. He's right about that to a certain extent.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, no one would miss me if I did die. Karen would think it was a gift from God. Mr. Knopff would only have to find a replacement for me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think would happen to Simian?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure he'd find a way to follow me to whatever afterlife I would have and torment me there, too. Actually, that thought alone is probably what keeps me from taking my own life. I figure if he will be with me after I die, there is no use in killing myself. I might as well stay alive and try to figure a way to get rid of him and lead a normal life. It's a thought that scares me though.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Because, for as long as I can remember, Simian has been with me, sort of guiding me along. Telling who to talk to, who to stay away from, how to deal with my problems. Sometimes I feel that I treat him like the devil, but the truth is he's helped me. He's given me courage in situations where I would have been too afraid, like the job at The Pit. I would have never gone in there and asked for a job if it wasn't for Simian. The thing is though, I'm beginning to think he's doing more harm than good.", "input": "", "output": "Can you give me an example?"}, {"instruction": "Well, last week sometime, this girl walks into the bar with a couple of other women. There was nothing too special about the two women--they were just your basic women bitches--but the girl...I don't know, there was something about her. She was cute, but that wasn't it. Anyway, they all found a table and the cute one came up to the bar and ordered their first round of drinks. I don't remember what the other ladies wanted, but her request fascinated me: a double bock. I was surprised. Not too many people order that; we don't even carry it. She seemed a little disturbed by that and ordered a Killians, I think. Anyway, my point is that later she came back over and chatted with me for a little bit. She didn't seem sexually interested in me, which is a first as far as women talking to me at the bar, and she did all the talking. Simian told me to stay away from her, that she was bad news. Ninety-nine percent of the time Simian is right about women, but about this one, I think he's completely wrong. She was fascinating. I didn't think women could talk so well. She talked a lot about beer--she knows her beer--and also about her cat. I've never had an animal before and she made me want to go out and get a cat. She loves that thing. I'm sorry, Doctor, I'm rambling about a woman.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right, Decker. I get a sense from you that you don't like women."}, {"instruction": "Not usually. I've never had a positive experience with a woman before, at least not until Chris--she's the girl in the bar. I mean I never talk to them. They scare me.", "input": "", "output": "What scares you about them?"}, {"instruction": "Simian tells me these horror stories about women using men to get what they want. Like, a women using her tits and other parts to attract a man so she can take all of his money and leave him or kill him. I don't need added troubles in my life. The entire concept of sex confuses me. If you haven't guessed, I've never had sex before. The only naked body I've seen is Karen and that woman she was with. Don't get me wrong, I liked what I saw. I think that's what scared me the most. I got an erection. I watched the woman run out of the room and could only imagine feeling her tits in my hands. I've never felt that before. It scared me.", "input": "", "output": "Decker, most men are aroused by the sight of a naked woman.  Feeling aroused is not something that should frighten you."}, {"instruction": "Well, the only woman I've ever really known is Karen. All she does is bitch and moan about everything I do and don't do. I don't find her attractive at all. Which I know is good...if I did find her attractive, I'd have even bigger problems. But I think my reactions to her carry over to other women that I meet. I don't want to get involved because I only have Karen's reactions to the things that I do, and I'm afraid that all women react the same way. I know it's not true, but Simian continually tells me that it is. After hearing it from him so many times, I guess on some level I believe it.", "input": "", "output": "Do you believe it about Chris?"}, {"instruction": "Well no. She's different. She had interesting things to say. When I talked to her, I didn't think about her tits. I saw her eyes. They were beautiful, sort of a hazel-green color, and so full of truth. I guess I didn't see her as a woman, but rather as a person. I really don't want to talk about this anymore, because I'm already going to over-analyze my first encounter with Chris as it is.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, we can talk more about it some other time. I'd like to ask you some other questions, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever hurt yourself on purpose?"}, {"instruction": "Nope.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever thought about it?"}, {"instruction": "If you mean, have I ever thought about killing myself? Yes, of course. Hasn't everyone thought about pulling the trigger at one time or other? The difference is whether or not you're serious.", "input": "", "output": "Well, have you ever been serious about killing yourself?"}, {"instruction": "I've held a gun to my head while it was loaded, yes. But the thought of being followed by Simian stopped me.", "input": "", "output": "How long ago was this?"}, {"instruction": "A couple of years ago. And no, I haven't done it since.", "input": "", "output": "You've never actually tried to commit suicide?"}, {"instruction": "Nope.  I've sat on my bed for a few hours with a gun to my head contemplating it. But I've never gone through with it! I look at suicide as a last resort kind of thing.", "input": "", "output": "How do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, if I can't get rid of Simian, and he is destroying my life, and nothing I do calms him, then yes, I might do it. But right now, I feel I'm very far from that. Death scares me too much to do it today or tomorrow. There are many things I want to change in my life. Like I want to live on my own. Simian has kept me from doing that. He tells me I won't make it and I will have to beg Karen to let me back in. But I want to know what it's like to be free from her shit. I also want to have a friend--I mean a real friend, not like Simian. I consider you a friend, Doctor, but if I called you to go to a ball game or something, I highly doubt you'd go with me. Not because you wouldn't want to be seen with me or something, but because I'm a patient. And I respect that. But I want an honest friend. Maybe someone like Chris. Someone who won't think I'm nuts. I'm so excited about trying these things right now that suicide is a long, long way off. But then again, I'm also scared that trying these things will cause suicide to come closer. Do you follow me here, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I think I do, Decker. But we've got to keep suicide out of the question for you. Working together, with a lot of hard work and dedication, I think you can achieve those goals and dreams.  And I'm really going to help you, Decker.  But the medication is very important.  That's first and foremost. The other things we'll work through here. I have to tell you, Decker, that I'm very impressed by the strength of your desire to get the help you need.  You've shown a lot of courage and strength to come and seek my help, and I respect you for that.  There are a lot of people in your situation who just give up, and don't think about getting the help they need."}, {"instruction": "See?  I owe that to Simian.", "input": "", "output": "I have my own ideas about Simian that we will work through in future sessions. But right now, let's take it a day at a time, all right?"}, {"instruction": "That's how I've lived my life.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like you to try something that's been helpful with other patients if you find the time. I'd like you to keep a daily journal if you could. It's nothing formal, just write down your thoughts, what you did that day, that sort of thing. Do you think you could do that?"}, {"instruction": "I'll give it a try.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I think it will help you see our progress as we go forward, okay? Decker, this was a very good session. We're out of time, now, but I want to see you next week, okay?"}, {"instruction": "I'll be here.", "input": "", "output": "That's great.  And be sure that you keep taking the medication.  That's very important, okay?  And if there are any problems, just give me a call, day or night.  The service knows how to get ahold of me, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Thank You.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Decker."}, {"instruction": "Well thank you, Doctor. I feel pretty good. The best I think I have ever felt. Like I told you on the phone, I feel like I have more energy then I ever had.", "input": "", "output": "That's really good to hear, Decker. Wow, you look really different without hair."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess I do. I like it. It's a nice change.", "input": "", "output": "It does look good on you, Decker."}, {"instruction": "So how have you been, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I've been fine."}, {"instruction": "Why the little chuckle, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I don't want to sound goofy or anything and I don't want to offend you, Decker. It's just I've never had you ask me questions about me personally before. It's quite a change for you, Decker."}, {"instruction": "I think that may be because I feel like a new person. I actually feel alive and like there just may be a reason for me to be here on the earth. It's an earth that I once felt was a hell.", "input": "", "output": "Let's try not to forget that--that hell you speak of really isn't that far in the past."}, {"instruction": "Wow, Doctor. That seems a little pessimistic coming from you.", "input": "", "output": "Oh...don't get me wrong, Decker. I'm not trying to discourage you by any means. It's just I want you to realize that not every day will be as wonderful and clear as today might be. Do you understand the difference?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I think I do. I know that my life from here on out still won't be everything that I hope it will be. It's in my nature to jump way, way ahead of myself. So I know it won't all be peaches and cream. However, I don't have a doubt that those bad days won't be as bad as a good day was before.", "input": "", "output": "I want you to revel in the good days, but I don't want you to become discouraged during the bad ones."}, {"instruction": "Fair enough, Doctor. Let's move on. I think we've exhausted this conversation.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Decker. What would you like to discuss now?"}, {"instruction": "Oh come on, Doctor. I know what you want to talk about. You want to hear the adventures of my life for the past couple of weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested."}, {"instruction": "Since I figured that most of this session would be about that anyway, I guess I'll let you in on my little story. This is how it started. Karen came into my room with the medication that I got from you. She was pissed. She started screaming at me about drugs being in her house and how she was going to call the police and have them drag my junkie ass off to jail. She tore my room apart looking for more drugs. I tried to explain to her what they were, but she just wouldn't fucking listen. She never listened to me. The more I tried to explain, the angrier she got. She threw a bottle of pills at me and they hit the wall and flew everywhere. This made her more pissed and she jumped on top of me. She began to hit and kick me everywhere. She was pulling my hair out and when I tried to push her off she would bite me. I....", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like it was a pretty intense scene."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you could say that. It was pretty confusing for me. I had no idea why she was so made. Her speech was all in hysterics and sporadic. I could feel the anger in me getting stronger and stronger and I just had to get out of there before I did something to her...you know what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "What happened, Decker?"}, {"instruction": "She got me in the face--a couple of good ones--and it set me off. I jumped up in a rage. Everything just turned white. I screamed at her that she was never going to hit me again and I pulled back and made a fist...", "input": "", "output": "Did you hit her?"}, {"instruction": "Well, like I said, everything went white. I sort of blocked everything out. I don't really remember much after that. I remember running out of the house. I don't know to this day if I hit her. The next thing I remember that day was that I was sitting in an alley crying. Later, while I was in jail, I remembered that I went to the bar to talk to Mr. Knopff, but he wasn't there. I remember I had nowhere to go, so I walked back to the house. That's when I found Karen dead. I thought for sure that I had killed her. I called 911.", "input": "", "output": "You called 911?"}, {"instruction": "I couldn't just leave her there. So anyway, I called 911 and then took off. I hung out on the streets for the night and then in the morning, I went back to the bar. The police were there and wanted to ask me some questions. I thought that since they wanted to ask me some questions, they must have thought I did it. I didn't know if I did but if they wanted to talk to me, I must have.  So I confessed. They took me down to the station and put me in this room where they asked me question after question. Stuff like have I ever hit her before. At one point they even asked me if I had ever had sexual relations with her. I said no, of course, and couldn't understand why they would ask me such a question. Anyway, they put me in this little room by myself and treated me rather nice. It wasn't anything like I expected it to be. They brought me my medication at the exact times when I was supposed to take it. The food wasn't that great, but jail was sort of relaxing, actually. I had time to put my thoughts together. The longer I stayed, the more I began to realize that I would never kill anyone, especially Karen. Even though I didn't like the woman, she was still my mother.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sad she's gone?"}, {"instruction": "No, not at all. She was a bitch. I do feel sorry for the pain she must have gone through, but there is a part of me that still holds onto the theory that it couldn't have happened to a nicer person. I know that sounds sick, but fuck it, that's how I feel.", "input": "", "output": "Those are some pretty strong emotions."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, it's still how I feel. Maybe it will change some day, but right now....Well anyway. It was sometime after the second night, I think, that they came and told me exactly what had happened to Karen. She had been raped and then beaten with a blunt object. Her skull was crushed. They think that she may have suffered quite a bit. The last blow is what killed her. She was hit about five or six times in all. Anyway, they had a semen sample and it didn't match my DNA. Or something to that effect. I didn't understand all the biology mumbo jumbo they were feeding me. Since it didn't match, they released me and I spent a couple of weeks here and there. I got to think a lot and the fear went away, so I went back to the bar and talked to Mr. Knopff. He knew everything that had happened. It seems that he checked on me everyday and the police told him everything that was going on. He knew when I was released.", "input": "", "output": "Why didn't he gather you up and make sure you were all right?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Mr. Knopff never has really offered me help. He waits for me to come to him and ask for it. I guess it has to do with that idea of staying out of everyone's business and mind your own. He's just like that. But when you go to him for help, he is very giving. He truly is a wonderful man and a true friend. I respect that a lot because I never really thought I had friends, and I do.", "input": "", "output": "So is he going to take you to a ball game?"}, {"instruction": "Well we haven't really talked about that but I'm sure if I suggested it he might play along with the idea.", "input": "", "output": "That's good to hear."}, {"instruction": "It's good to feel, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure it is. So is that the story of your adventure?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, pretty much. Now I'm just back at the bar, working my old schedule. I still haven't been to Karen's house, but I am going to have to go there soon and look through some stuff. Mr. Knopff told me that he would help me sell the house so I got to clean it up. That's about it.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Decker, it sounds like you are doing pretty good. I'm very glad to hear you are not a murderer."}, {"instruction": "Well, it was a little sketchy there for awhile.", "input": "", "output": "Is there anything else you would like to discuss? We have a few more minutes."}, {"instruction": "I do want to apologize.", "input": "", "output": "Oh...what for?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't been keeping a journal. I never got around to getting a note book, and my thoughts were not with journal writing.", "input": "", "output": "I understand, Decker. However, I would still like you to give it a shot if you think about it."}, {"instruction": "Will do.", "input": "", "output": "How has Simian been treating you?"}, {"instruction": "I wish I could say that he is completely gone, but I still hear from him about once a day for a very brief moment. It's a little annoying but I can deal with it.", "input": "", "output": "It's good to know that you can deal with it. You may never be able to completely get rid of Simian. The medication may or may not wash him out, but it will muffle him. That's why it is imperative that you keep taking your medication."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, try to have a little faith in me. I just went through two weeks of hell and I managed to take the right dose at the right time even through all of that.", "input": "", "output": "You're right, Decker. Forgive me."}, {"instruction": "Forgiven.", "input": "", "output": "We are about out of time, so until next week?"}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Decker."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Well hello there, Decker. How are you feeling today?"}, {"instruction": "About one hundred and ten percent better. Thanks for asking. But I had a couple of rough nights.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I had a terrible cold. My sinuses were completely clogged, and my head felt like it weighed about two tons. I had a horrible time sleeping.", "input": "", "output": "But have you been sleeping well otherwise?  I mean when you're not sick."}, {"instruction": "Like a baby, Doctor. Where does that phrase come from anyway? The only babies I have ever seen have been screaming and crying like mad. They sure weren't sleeping too well.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure where that saying came either.  It's always struck me as a particularly inapposite expression, too. But I'm glad that you've been sleeping well. How is the medication working?"}, {"instruction": "Pretty good, I guess. I mean I'm still taking it. I've sort of resigned to the fact that I'll be taking it for the rest of my life.", "input": "", "output": "You're probably right about that. Does that idea scare you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, sort of. I mean I would like to be able to go one day without taking the medication to, you know, have a clear mind for an entire day. But I know that the way my mind is set up, clear is not a word that it knows. What I mean is that even without the medication, my mind wouldn't be clear. So I might as well keep taking it and keep myself sane, rather than stop and go insane.", "input": "", "output": "I think it's a good idea for you to keep taking the medication, although if you feel this one has side effects, we can look at other therapies."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, I guess I know that it's a good idea.", "input": "", "output": "Have you made it over to Karen's house yet?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Mr. Knopff and I went over there Monday morning. We really didn't do too much, but Mr. Knopff found some papers that he thought should be looked at by a lawyer. I don't know why, but he gave them to his lawyer none the less.", "input": "", "output": "Well, what did the lawyer have to say?"}, {"instruction": "Not much. I got a phone call from him this morning and he wants to see me tomorrow, if at all possible. He didn't tell me what it was about. I have an appointment with him at 11:30, so I guess I'll find out then.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I hope it's good news. How is work?"}, {"instruction": "Same old, same old.", "input": "", "output": "Can you elaborate?"}, {"instruction": "What's there to elaborate on? Someone orders a drink. I make the drink. They drink the drink. They order another. I make another. They drink another. Same old, same old.", "input": "", "output": "You don't seem very interested in being here today, Decker. Is there a problem?"}, {"instruction": "No, not at all. I still have some ill feelings left over from the summer cold. Summer colds....man, do they suck. I'll have a runny nose all summer now because of this damn thing. Then I'll have to kick it in the middle of winter, so that it doesn't reoccur next summer. Pain in my ass.", "input": "", "output": "You seem a little grumpy today."}, {"instruction": "Just tired. If it's all the same to you, Doctor, I'd just rather call it a session.  Okay? Let me get out of here.", "input": "", "output": "Well actually, Decker, I'd like to ask you some more questions. Is that all right?"}, {"instruction": "Jesus H. Christ, Doctor! Would you get the fuck off my back? I said I'd rather not fucking talk.", "input": "", "output": "All right, all right. Calm down, Decker..."}, {"instruction": "Fuck you! What are you afraid of?  That if I'll over-react to something, I might lose my mind and bash your head in, too? Is that what you really think of me, Doc? Well, fuck you! I don't need this shit...", "input": "", "output": "Decker? Wait! Where are you going? Decker, come back!"}, {"instruction": "Don't sound so--what's the word I'm looking for?--sure. What did you expect, to see me all dirty or something?", "input": "", "output": "Well, I must admit that I didn't expect to see you in such high spirits. I mean it, you really look good."}, {"instruction": "Well thank you, Doctor. I've gone through some changes since I saw you last. But before we get into all that, I've got something I would like to say to you.", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead, Decker. I'm listening."}, {"instruction": "Well, I want to thank you, Doctor Balis. You've been very important to me in the short time that I've known you. You see, when I first walked through your door, I thought my life was over. I didn't have anyone to turn to. Mr. Knopff was a nice enough man, but he really didn't want to hear about my problems. I guess if he had to listen to my problems, it'd have made his life more miserable than it already was. Mr. Knopff recently lost his wife and his only son in a car accident, and he was on the verge of losing his mind, too. So talking to him just wasn't the answer. He knew it, and so did I. I was a lost soul, and you helped me find it. I know that this is your job and all and you get paid very well to perform that job, but I just wanted to tell you that I consider you a friend. Whether you consider me a friend doesn't really concern me. I feel comfortable enough with the fact that I finally have a friend that I can confide in and trust--even if it is a one-sided friendship. So I guess all I'm saying is thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Well, you're welcome. And I do care about you, Decker, and I want to help you succeed and live a happy life."}, {"instruction": "I appreciate it.", "input": "", "output": "Good. So how are you doing these days?"}, {"instruction": "I'm all right, Doctor. It's great to be back here. I really missed this little office and the comfy chairs.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's true, I did miss this place. It seems like it's the only place I was able to be myself. The entire time I was in Chicago, Simian kept telling me that I needed to get back here and talk to you.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You don't seem surprised that I mentioned Simian?", "input": "", "output": "To be quite frank, I'm not. I assume you stopped taking your medication--if not when you stormed out of here, then when your prescription ran out. I'm sure that after you stopped taking it, Simian returned."}, {"instruction": "Well, you're right. But he's not the same person he was before. I thought he'd be extremely angry with me for trying to rub him out, but he wasn't. I feel bad; I really hurt the old fellow. I hurt his feelings. But when he came back, he told me that the last thing he wanted was to drive me into an insane asylum.", "input": "", "output": "So he hasn't been harassing you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he has his moments of annoyance just like any other person, but he doesn't force me into making irrational decisions anymore. He lets me think my decisions through without interjecting. Of course, when I make a decision that he doesn't agree with, he tells me what he would do and he might put me down for not listening, but he's fair. I'd consider him a friend, except I know that he's just me. Sometimes I have a difficult time remembering that he's not a real person but rather a figment of my own imagination. I guess he's really my imaginary friend--sounds kind of funny, doesn't it, Doctor? I mean a twenty-six year old man playing with his imaginary friend? It's kind of like that movie with Phoebe Cates where she has an imaginary friend named Fred. I can never remember the names of movies. Anyway, I told my father about you and Simian, and he said that you would probably think I was a schizo. Do you think I'm schizo, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I believe you're suffering from schizophrenia. Do you think you are?"}, {"instruction": "I don't really know. I do know that it's a little strange that I talk to Simian like I talk to you--out loud, I mean. But maybe that's just the way I deal with things. I never had any friends growing up--Karen wouldn't allow it. So I had to do something to gain companionship. Boy, that bitch really fucked me up, didn't she, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "A mother always has a strong effect on her children. When she is abusive, like Karen was, then that effect can be strongly negative."}, {"instruction": "That would be an understatement. Simian has asked me if I'm sorry that she is gone. That's a very tough question to answer. I'm sorry that she felt so much pain. But, on the other hand, I'm not sorry that she's no longer around. Is that bad?", "input": "", "output": "I think that it's not unusual for an abused person to feel the way you do. Karen was a troubled woman. I'm not trying to justify what she did to you, but she had some major problems, too."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I understand that after talking to my father.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you tell me more about your father?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure if I have time to tell the whole story...", "input": "", "output": "Well, you can start. And if we run out of time, you can finish next week."}, {"instruction": "Okay, that sounds fair. Well, I guess I'll start a few days after I ran out of our last session. I went back to Karen's house. I was going through some things and found a bank statement in a desk in her room. As you can imagine, I had a hard time going through that desk, because I was never even allowed in her room, let alone the desk. Anyway, the statement was addressed to me. I was shocked--I never got mail. The statement was postmarked on April 8, 1992--my twenty-first birthday. I wanted to find out more, so I called the number on the bank statement. They told me that they had some kind of savings bond in my name that was worth over $250,000 and I could claim it with identification. So I went to Chicago--a huge step for a guy that rarely left his own room.", "input": "", "output": "That was a pretty big step."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, I got to Chicago, found the bank, showed them my ID, and walked out with a cashiers check for $253,987.46. It was as easy as that. I thought that they'd make me strip down or something. I didn't know what to expect, you know? Then I took a cab back to O'Hare and started to wonder for the first time where this money came from. I'm sure Karen didn't give it to me. So I went back to the bank to see if I could find out who had started the bond for me. They told me that a man by the name of Anthony Parish started the bond in June of 1971 for his son--me. The only address they gave me was Karen's--right here in San Francisco. I almost passed out. Karen always told me that my father didn't exist. I assumed that he was one of Karen's one-nighters. Karen never spoke of him, and whenever I asked I was hit. I guess I just assumed he was a loser or something. So I decided to stay in Chicago and see if I could find him.", "input": "", "output": "This is really a fascinating story, Decker."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and there's a lot more.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't we stop here and continue next week?"}, {"instruction": "That's fine with me.", "input": "", "output": "Decker, before you go, I want to know how you feel about going back on your medication?"}, {"instruction": "I really don't think that's necessary, Doctor. I feel much better, and Simian is not bothering me at all.", "input": "", "output": "I agree that you seem to be very good. But as a precautionary measure..."}, {"instruction": "I really don't want to take it, Doctor. It don't feel clear-headed when I'm on that stuff. How about we make a pact? If you feel that Simian is interfering with my rational thinking and if I feel that he's bothering me, then I'll start taking it again. But right now, I want to see what will happen if I don't take it. While I was in Chicago, I survived fine without it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Okay. I won't force you to take medication. But if I see any signs of negative behavior from you or from Simian, then you have to take it. Deal?"}, {"instruction": "Fair enough. Deal.", "input": "", "output": "It was good seeing you, Decker. Same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "That's fine. Oh, one more thing. I've been writing a little--just some poems, I guess you'd call them that. Would you like to see them? They might give you some insight to my being.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, that would be good."}, {"instruction": "Okay, here they are.", "input": "", "output": "I'll read them this week."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you next week then. Goodbye, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Decker."}, {"instruction": "It's 11:20, Doctor.  Twenty minutes late! Just because I'm a schizophrenic, you can just shit all over me?", "input": "", "output": "Decker, I assure you that I had no intention of causing any disrespect towards you. And I apologize if this has caused you to miss any other appointments..."}, {"instruction": "It's just time, Doctor. It's just time.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Decker, I don't understand."}, {"instruction": "Oh forget it, Doctor. No matter how I'll try to explain it to you, even you wouldn't be able to follow. Let's just get on with the rest of my story.", "input": "", "output": "Decker, just relax for a moment. Catch your breath. Slow down a bit. Okay, good. Now, what's bothering you today?"}, {"instruction": "What's bothering me?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. What's bothering you? I realize that starting a session late could cause some frustration, but it shouldn't cause rage. Therefore, I believe that there is something else that is contributing to the rage I just witnessed. What is it?"}, {"instruction": "You are pretty good at this therapist thing, Doctor. Although I don't think I would have called it rage.", "input": "", "output": "Well, what would you call it, Decker?"}, {"instruction": "Fury, maybe. But rage? That's so...it's an evil word.", "input": "", "output": "What is the difference between the words?"}, {"instruction": "Rage gives the impression of a mad man. I just equate rage with death, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "And with what do you equate fury?"}, {"instruction": "Pure anger! Doctor, I have to tell you something, and I don't want you to think that I'm being disrespectful of you or your profession. This is honestly the first time that I've ever seen you act like a doctor. I see you psychoanalyzing my brain as we speak, and I answer your questions, and it's not becoming of you.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. That's interesting. I would, however, like to hear the answer to my initial question. What's bothering you, Decker?"}, {"instruction": "Fair enough. I guess I'm just nervous. I have an appointment with someone later this afternoon about an apartment. I'm worried that the guy will think I'm just a little left of center and not lease the place to me.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I think landlords are usually more interested in your financial situation. The guy might not even notice what color hair you have."}, {"instruction": "I don't have any hair.", "input": "", "output": "See? And besides, you can make a very good first impression if you try.  I know you can. So is there anything else?  Is there something else bothering you?"}, {"instruction": "I sure hope you're right. And yes, there is another thing that has been occupying my mind--my dad's coming tonight. He's staying at some fancy place downtown; I'm meeting him in the restaurant for dinner at eight. He's a nice man and all, but it's just that I don't know him and he wants to be my father. I haven't figured it out yet.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it may take some time getting used to having a father. Why don't you tell me how you found him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, after I found out his name, I began to think that I almost never was Decker Jenkins--I could have been Decker Parish or something else Parish, you know? And that felt very strange, almost like I didn't know myself. It turned the desire to find him and find out about that other part of myself--a self I didn't know--into a need to know more. But the more I thought about it, the more nervous I got. I even started losing my breath. It became very hard to focus on anything, and breathing was so hard. I thought I was going to die. Next thing I remember, I was sitting up against a tall building with all these people staring at me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "This lady with long red, almost orange, hair and bright red lipstick told me to breathe deep. She said I was hyperventilating. Anyway, that woman is another story that I'll save for later, but she got me to calm down. Her name was Pam, and I stayed with her while I was in Chicago. But like I said, that's another story. Anyway, she helped me track down dad. We found out that he lived in the Hancock Building on the 44th floor. We didn't have a phone number, so we just decided that I would go and knock on his door. I tried that. It wasn't that easy. First, they wouldn't let me into the elevator that went up to the apartments in the building. I couldn't convince the security guard guy who I was. He just kept telling me that he knew Mr. Parish didn't have a son or any visitors, for that matter. So that was problem number one.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I would like to get back to the hyperventilating after you've finished your story."}, {"instruction": "Problem number two--he wasn't home. I finally convinced the security guard to call my dad, but he wasn't home. So I thought I'd wait. Well, the first fifteen minutes I waited, about a hundred people got on that elevator. Eighty percent of them were men--but none of them appeared to be my dad. I did this for about a week and decided that he was either out of town or the doormen had told him about me and now he was avoiding me. So I gave the doorman the number to Pam's apartment and asked him to give it to Mr. Parish the next time he saw him. It took about a month. I was ready to give up and come back here when a man called. He had a very deep voice and sounded rather important. He asked for me, and I told him that he had me. He then said he was my father. We met for dinner at some fancy restaurant. Pam helped me shop for the clothes that I needed for the place--shirt, tie, and those sort of things. I went to the restaurant and asked for Mr. Parish. The guy in the tux took me to a table where I was sitting--Mr. Parish was me! The guy looked just like me. I knew instantly he was my dad. And he acted like my father. It was very strange and very uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I spent about a week with him and learned some things about my life before I remember--all stuff that I'm sure will come out later. But enough about this, I don't really want to get too deep today. Next week, I'll tell you about Pam. That will really shock you, Doc. What did you think of my writing?", "input": "", "output": "Your poetry? I thought it was very dark."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it is that.", "input": "", "output": "I think writing is a good way for you to express some of your feelings and emotions. I would like you to keep writing if you could."}, {"instruction": "Sure. Here is another one I wrote.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. Before we quit for today, I want to give a prescription for your medication."}, {"instruction": "Come on, Doc. I didn't even mention Simian today. He hasn't bothered me for a long time, not since Pam anyway.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. But I still think it would be best if you returned to taking this medication on regular basis.  Your outburst today is a clear example of that, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "I feel fine, Doctor Balis. I...", "input": "", "output": "We had a deal."}, {"instruction": "All right. However, I don't need them. But if you think I need them...", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Decker. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Sorry about last week. I didn't really want to cancel, but dad wanted to take me all over Northern California that day. He convinced me that one missed session wasn't going to send me on a killing spree.", "input": "", "output": "That's all right, Decker. I'm glad you called and let me know instead of just not showing up."}, {"instruction": "Well, I think I've done that enough to you in the past.", "input": "", "output": "So, how is your relationship going with your father?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's going okay, I guess. It's just that...I don't know...I have no idea what to talk to him about. He's a very successful man with lots of money that he's been throwing at me the entire time he was here. But money just isn't what I want from him. Don't get me wrong, Doc, it sure is helping quite a bit at the moment, but I think that's how he's trying to show me his love, and it's just not working.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk to him about that?"}, {"instruction": "No, I hardly had time to talk. He did all the talking.", "input": "", "output": "What did he talk about?"}, {"instruction": "Basically, he talked about his life with Karen. They met in the summer of '68--you know, the summer of love? Anyway, Karen was a hippie, he said. From the time he met her, she was heavy into drugs like marijuana, LSD, and that sort of thing. He was going to school in California, and they just kind of hooked up. He said he was able to curb Karen's drug habits, however she just wouldn't give up marijuana. They ended up getting married in early August of 1970, because they found out Karen was pregnant with little old me. He said Karen smoked dope the entire pregnancy, and then I was born in April of '71. I guess that's when most of their problems started. He said Karen paid no attention to me--she acted like I never existed. He was the one that woke up in the middle of the night and fed me and changed my diapers. Anyway, to make a long story short, she wouldn't quit the drugs, so he left. When he tried to take me, she threatened to kill me and him. So he just left. He said he was afraid of her.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How does that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't really know the man and never have. Life with Karen is all I ever knew. I can't really say how I feel. Sure, I'm a little angry with him for not fighting for me. But I don't really know if I would have had a better life with him. I get the impression that he works all the time, so he probably wouldn't have been there for me either. Maybe I just would've experienced less abuse with him.  But I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "There's more than just physical abuse, Decker."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess you're right. Anyway, let's move on. I'm tired of talking about that. Plus, I have a couple of other things that I'd like to discuss with you before my session ends.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Decker. What's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "First off, I said I would tell you about Pam. Hold onto your seat, Doctor, this is going to blow you away.", "input": "", "output": "Shoot."}, {"instruction": "Well, like I said before, I stayed with Pam while I was in Chicago. First, she was a lot of fun. She took me to a lot of great places. We had fun. Then, she started to get a little frisky with me--holding my hand, giving me little pecks on the cheek, that sort of thing. Then one night, I was sleeping on the couch, and she came in and started playing with me. I didn't know what to do, so I acted like I was still asleep. One thing lead to another, and next thing I knew I was inside her. Very freaky, Doctor. I continued to act like I was asleep, which was very difficult. I just didn't know what to do. Anyway, she finished or I did--I don't really know who was first. Are you following me, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I think I know what you mean."}, {"instruction": "Well, the next morning, she asked me if I thought she was pretty. I told her that she was very pretty. She then took off her robe--she was completely naked. I instantly became aroused, and she noticed and took advantage of the fact. Doc, she did things to me that morning that I never thought of. It was very enjoyable.", "input": "", "output": "Did you use protection, Decker?"}, {"instruction": "No, why?", "input": "", "output": "Well, there are a lot of diseases out there that can cause serious health problems like AIDS.  These are transmitted..."}, {"instruction": "She promised me that she got checked every six months and that she was clean. She knew I was a virgin, so she wasn't concerned. And it just happened--I had no control over the situation.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I could get tested, if you like. Anyway, this continued for the rest of the time that I was in Chicago. It was a fuck-fest, Doc. So when it came time to leave and come back here, Pam freaked out. She screamed and yelled about how I just used her for a little puss and then I was going to leave her. She went so far as to say I raped her. That's when I called you and said that I thought I might be in some trouble. I left that day and haven't heard from her since. For all I know, there's a warrant for my arrest in Chicago.", "input": "", "output": "Did you rape her, Decker?"}, {"instruction": "No! Not at all. If anything, she raped me.", "input": "", "output": "I believe you. But this can be very serious, Decker."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm not about to call her and ask if she went to the police with her story. I haven't heard anything, and dad said he hasn't heard anything. So I think I'm okay. None the less, I'm no longer a virgin, Doctor. Isn't that great?", "input": "", "output": "I'm very happy for you. But I'm also concerned. I would like for you to get checked out--get tested for AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. While I believe your story, Pam seems to be a very unstable individual.  You might in fact be in trouble with Chicago's Police Department."}, {"instruction": "But I told you, no crime was committed. I didn't do anything!", "input": "", "output": "And I believe that. Let's just wait and see what, if anything, develops.  We'll deal with more when there's a need to deal with it. So let's move on for now. Is there something else you specifically wanted to discuss with me?"}, {"instruction": "Well, this is the exciting stuff. I met another woman. She's great and very beautiful. I met her at the bar. I went in to talk to Mr. Knopff, and she just approached me. She talked a lot. She likes baseball. She mentioned that there was some exhibit somewhere in town that had baseball stuff, and I agreed to meet her there. But there's a problem.", "input": "", "output": "What is it?"}, {"instruction": "I'm a little nervous. I really like this girl--she's not like others. But I'm not sure if I'm going to go.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Just because I don't know what her intentions are. Besides, she probably won't even show up.", "input": "", "output": "You don't know that. I think you should go. If she's not there, fine.  But if she does show up, you would have made another friend. It would be good if you had a friend to talk to. What's her name?"}, {"instruction": "That's the funny part--I met her before in the bar. Her name is Christina. Do you remember I was telling you about the girl that came in and ordered a Double Bock some time ago? Well, it was her. She looks slightly different, but as soon as I saw her, I knew it was her. I acted like I didn't remember her. I still don't know why I did that. I guess I was nervous. I think this can go somewhere, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "That's very interesting. But I think you shouldn't develop very high expectations from this relationship. Just a moment ago, you were telling me that you didn't even want to go to a date that you've already set up with this woman.  And now, you're talking about a possible serious relationship. Take it easy. This is just a social encounter, nothing more.  Go the baseball show and see what happens. Don't put any pressure on yourself or this woman, okay? Well, Decker, we're almost out of time. How is the medication coming?"}, {"instruction": "I'm taking it, if that's what you're asking.", "input": "", "output": "And Simian?"}, {"instruction": "Gone. I haven't heard from him for a few days.", "input": "", "output": "And how's your mood been lately? Any bad feelings?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. Just a couple of downs, but nothing terrible.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. Keep up with the medication, okay?"}, {"instruction": "I will. I promised you, and I keep my promises.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Do you have any more writings for me?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Just one, though. Here it is.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. So do you want to make this time our regular time?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I would, if you don't mind.", "input": "", "output": "Then I'll see you here next Thursday at 10 am."}, {"instruction": "I'll be here. Goodbye, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Decker."}, {"instruction": "I'm feeling okay, just a little tired. I think I may be coming down with a cold. I'm not sure yet, though.", "input": "", "output": "Did anything exciting happen this past week?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. It was a fairly uneventful week. This may be a boring session for you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I haven't had any flashbacks with Simian, or any rage outbursts, so I don't have anything that you can question. Actually, I felt like a normal human being this week. Kind of scary, huh?", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you had a good week. How have you been sleeping lately?"}, {"instruction": "I get about five to six hours a night. That's an eternity compared to what I used to get. Plus, the new place I got is really quiet.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I've been meaning to ask you. You had an appointment to see an apartment. I guess it went well?"}, {"instruction": "It went really well. The man that showed me the place was very nice. He seemed to like me, and I definitely liked him. The place was a little run down, but I liked it. It's just a little loft with a nice view, and the other tenants in the building are mostly students. I've actually had a visitor since I've moved in.", "input": "", "output": "Already?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. He had a weird name. Telso, I think--he was kind of hard to understand. He had a Spanish accent. I mean a deep Spanish accent. He was nice, though. He just came up to welcome me. I thought that was very nice. I was watching a football game at the time, and he joined me. We had a couple of beers--which he brought--and had a good time. It was nice. I felt normal.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "I think I'm adjusting well. I feel more comfortable with people. I still don't talk as much as I would like to. But hey, I'm not complaining. I tried something new, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "And what would that be?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I wondered if I should tell you. I don't think you are going to like it too much, but what the hell. Promise me you won't bite my head off for this one. I just tried it. It's something I've always wanted to try.", "input": "", "output": "What is it, Decker?"}, {"instruction": "Telso and I smoked a joint.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. And what did you think?"}, {"instruction": "A lot. I'm surprised, Doctor. I thought you would flip over this one.", "input": "", "output": "I'm unhappy about it, Decker.  But there's not much I can do about it in retrospect.  I don't approve of recreational drug use.  And especially in your situation, Decker, when you're taking risperidone, it can be very dangerous.  I hope this will never happen again."}, {"instruction": "Drugs, Doctor? Let me tell you, the joint I smoked made me feel a hell of a lot better then the drugs you gave me. Doctor, let's not get angry here. I see it in your face. I'm just messing with you. I smoked the joint because I wanted to know what the big deal was. I found out. So now you shouldn't worry about me becoming a heroin addict or something--it's over and done with. Sometimes, I get the impression that you think I'm only a kid. I'm almost twenty-seven. Let me try these things, Doctor. I don't need to have you tell me the dangers. I already know what they are. I never had a chance to experiment with anything--sex, drugs, even rock and roll. Karen never let me even have a radio, let alone compact discs. I'm beginning to like my life.", "input": "", "output": "I understand your desire to experiment with new things, Decker.  But please keep in mind that you have a problem.  What might be okay for some to try once, may have disastrous effects on you.  You have to be a lot more careful than most.  This doesn't mean that you shouldn't play the music you like, or have sex, or enjoy other types of entertainment.  But you have to stay away from drugs and alcohol, too. Understand?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Thanks, Doc. Do you think we can cut this short? I really don't have anything that I need to discuss--I had a boring week.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think it's a good idea, Decker. We only see each other once a week, that's not a lot of time."}, {"instruction": "But...", "input": "", "output": "I know that therapy feels like hard work sometimes. But it is work and..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I just don't want to. Okay? Nothing happened to me this last week...", "input": "", "output": "And what about your experiments with pot?"}, {"instruction": "God, it was nothing. I wish I didn't bother mentioning it to you. I've got to go now.", "input": "", "output": "And what about your date with Chris?"}, {"instruction": "See you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Decker? Decker!"}, {"instruction": "I'm doing okay. Actually, I don't feel too good. I have a bit of a headache, and my stomach is a little upset.", "input": "", "output": "I see...how late did you stay out last night, Decker?"}, {"instruction": "What are you talking about? I didn't go out at all.", "input": "", "output": "Okay...how much did you drink then?"}, {"instruction": "You're pretty good, Doctor. How did you know that I went out and drank?", "input": "", "output": "You smell like a brewery. Decker, didn't anything I said to you last week sink in? Drinking combined with your medication may have serious adverse consequences."}, {"instruction": "That's why I didn't take the medication yesterday.", "input": "", "output": "It doesn't work that way, Decker. You still have the medication in your system for some time after taking it. And stopping your medication, for any reason, is a bad idea in the first place. Even without the medication, drinking for you is not a good idea. You simply should not drink."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, I am a grown man. I think I should be able to make that decision on my own. You said yourself that I should try and get myself in the main stream, be a normal person. Normal people have a few drinks and take it a little too far sometimes. I can't promise you that I...Doctor can I have a glass of water, I'm a little dehydrated. I'll be right back...I think I'm going to be sick. Sorry about that; I can't seem to get the tequila taste out of my mouth. That's some nasty stuff.", "input": "", "output": "I don't find this at all amusing. It is not safe. If you are getting sick from the amount of drinking you did last night, I don't think you took it a little too far--you took it way too far."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doctor, I get your point. It was a one time event all right?", "input": "", "output": "All right, Decker. I'll have to take your word for it. So did you at least have a good time?"}, {"instruction": "As a matter of fact, I did. Telso and I had a great time.", "input": "", "output": "You went out with Telso?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. And no, I didn't smoke any pot with him, if that's your next question. We just had some beers and a few shots. Telso really knows how to have a good time. It was fun. I feel relaxed with him.", "input": "", "output": "Although I don't particularly agree with your actions, I'm glad that you are beginning to interact socially. You just need to be careful. Let's move on. How did your date with Chris go last week?"}, {"instruction": "It was fantastic. She truly is a interesting person, and, wow, what a body!", "input": "", "output": "You and Chris didn't...."}, {"instruction": "I wish, but no, we didn't. We just went to the exhibit. I felt extremely comfortable there. I guess it's just because I had a lot to talk about. I think that is the most I have ever talked to anyone--except you, of course. She seemed extremely interested in what I had to say, too.", "input": "", "output": "What did you talk about?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I did a lot of quoting statistics. She asked a lot of questions about teams and players and stuff like that. She sure doesn't know too much about baseball. She didn't realize that the Bay Area had two teams. Can you imagine that, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Does it?  Just kidding--the A's and the Giants, right?  I'll bet there are a lot of women and a lot of men too, who wouldn't know that."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Well, I gave her a run down of all the teams and what league and division they are in. Of course, some of them are going to change next year but I didn't mention that. She seemed a little confused about the divisions anyway and I didn't want to confuse her any more. I really like her, Doctor, and I think she may have the same feelings.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? What makes you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, after a while of walking around, I decided to make a move. I grabbed her hand and held it as we walked. She didn't let go so there must be something in that. Plus after a while, she put her arm in mine. It was very exciting, however I was too nervous to try and kiss her at the end of the date. May I be excused again, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "If you must. I don't want your tequila all over my floor."}, {"instruction": "Again I'm sorry. I'm beginning to think that last night really wasn't such a good idea after all.", "input": "", "output": "So you and Chris hit it off pretty good?"}, {"instruction": "I like to think so. After the exhibit, we went to a restaurant and had a couple of drinks.", "input": "", "output": "Decker, I thought you said last night was a one time event?"}, {"instruction": "I did. It was a one time event of drinking too much. We only had a few, Doctor. I didn't even get a buzz.", "input": "", "output": "It is still dangerous."}, {"instruction": "Fine...no more drinking.", "input": "", "output": "So are you and Chris going to see each other again?"}, {"instruction": "I certainly hope so. Doctor, I really don't feel so good.", "input": "", "output": "All right, Decker. We'll end for today, but these short session have to stop. I schedule the sessions for an hour for a reason, Decker, and these short ones accomplish too little."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I thought that next week we'd start talking a little bit more about your childhood with Karen.  You might want to think about that a little this week."}, {"instruction": "My childhood.  Fine. See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Decker. And no more drinking and take your medication. Decker, did you hear me?"}, {"instruction": "Sorry about that. But I'm glad you're here, Doc...just glad you're here.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? And why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, you're going to think I'm an idiot after telling you this, but I forgot last Thursday was Thanksgiving.", "input": "", "output": "Don't tell me you showed up for your session last week?"}, {"instruction": "As a matter of fact...", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Decker. I should have called you and..."}, {"instruction": "Well, I would have known it was canceled, if I'd used my brain. But I was just going through the motions of a Thursday morning, and it never even crossed my mind until I went to pull open the front door and it was locked. At first, I was a little confused, but then I realized everything else was closed too. Let me tell you, I felt like a dope.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you can laugh about it."}, {"instruction": "Well, it is kind of funny. The people walking by probably thought I was a lunatic--I kept trying to pull the door open wondering why the damn thing was locked. Then when it hit me, I turned around and there was some guy walking by, and I just said, \"Oh shit, it's Thanksgiving.\" He looked at me kind of strange and kept walking. Then I burst into laughter.", "input": "", "output": "So what did you do for Thanksgiving?"}, {"instruction": "Not a damn thing. Just sat in my apartment and watched football. I had a ham sandwich with potato chips for lunch and then channel surfed all day and night. It was rather relaxing--not a worry in my mind that day.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. Did you feel lonely?"}, {"instruction": "After the childhood I've had, a quiet holiday was very refreshing. Not a soul bothered me. And I didn't have to be on my best behavior, worrying if I would say or do something that would result in me getting smacked on the side of the head with a spoon or fist or whatever was handy. It was an enjoyable day.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  I wanted to ask you why you canceled our last session?"}, {"instruction": "I had to bail Telso out of jail. He got arrested on some drug charges. They found a bunch of cocaine on him the night before during a routine traffic stop. I guess this is like the third or fourth time he's been arrested for it, so he's pretty afraid of getting some jail time this time.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Whatever, it's really not my concern.", "input": "", "output": "Do I hear some animosity there?"}, {"instruction": "You could say that. It cost me a fortune to get him out of jail, and he promised to pay me back that day after he did a few things. I haven't seen him since. I don't know where he is. I don't really care either, although I would like the money back. If he jumps bail, it's my ass.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Decker. I hope you get your money back. Anyway, I was hoping to talk a bit about your childhood. Do you think you're up for it?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, what's the hell. There really isn't much to tell. I got hit a lot, and I never got anything. Karen always did what she wanted to do. She never even thought about me, unless she thought I did something that deserved a nice beating. Sometimes, I got one just because she felt like hitting something. I guess I was softer then the wall.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have any fond memories of Karen?"}, {"instruction": "Other than seeing her get beat up herself? Not really.", "input": "", "output": "Was Karen abused as well?"}, {"instruction": "Karen didn't bring home the local preacher from down the street, you know. The guys she brought home for dinner liked to eat, fuck, and then beat.Well, most of them, anyway. Some of them would hit me, too. A lot of the time, it was Karen who was the one that asked them to do it. She would tell them that she could not control me and that I needed a good beating by a man. They were more than happy to do it, if they knew there was a good blow job in it for them. Karen never hid her sexual relations from me. She would do it anywhere. A lot of the time, I would get hit by the men because I would walk out and see them making it on the kitchen table or something. Guys don't like other guys watching them fuck a woman, even if the woman is a trashy whore.", "input": "", "output": "Did you like any of the men that Karen brought home?"}, {"instruction": "Not too many of them ever came back for seconds. I doubt if Karen even knew most of their names, and I'm sure they didn't care to know hers. Occasionally, she'd have a man that stayed around for awhile. They were few and far between. But there was this one guy, Ralph was his name if I remember correctly. He stayed for about a week and a half. He lived with us during that time. I guess you can call this a fond memory of Karen. During that time, she was nice to me. She made dinner every night, and we all sat at the table and ate. It was very strange to do that, though. I remember thinking that Karen was trying to make this guy think that we were one big happy family, and that she was trying to find someone who would love her and her wonderful son. It was all an act of course, but it was a great week. The three of us would actually go to the movies and do family stuff like that. I knew it wouldn't last long, because Karen would fuck it up somehow.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Ralph and I were at home one night watching TV or something, and I remember Ralph was pretty pissed. Karen was supposed to be home from work, but she wasn't. Ralph threw me in the car and told me to take him to where she worked. So I did. He went in, and about five minutes later, we were driving to some guy's house. Ralph told me to wait in the car, and he got something out of the trunk. Then he went into the house. I heard this gunshot a few minutes later. I jumped out of the car because I was very scared. Ralph came out alone, jumped in the car, and sped off. I hid in the bushes for what seemed like forever, then I decided to go inside. I saw Karen sitting on the bed naked. She was covered--and I mean totally covered--in blood. There was another naked body laying on the floor. The only difference was that his head was missing. Now that I think back, his head was splattered all over Karen.", "input": "", "output": "How old were you then?"}, {"instruction": "About eleven or twelve.", "input": "", "output": "Had Simian made his appearance yet?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, I don't remember. No, I don't think so. But if he wasn't there then, it was very soon after.", "input": "", "output": "So what happened to Ralph?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Karen never spoke of him again, and I never saw him again. Karen was messed up for a long time after that. She would go into hysterics in the middle of the night. She started drinking more and doing drugs. That's when the beatings really started, and I started to stay in my room all the time.", "input": "", "output": "Did Karen hit you before this time at all?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but not nearly as much or as bad.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I survived, though...not without having my own problems.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's why you come to see me, so we can work through these problems.  We don't have much time left, so let's change the subject for now. Have you talked to Chris?"}, {"instruction": "No, with the holidays and all, I think she has been busy with the family and that sort of thing. I may call her this week. It would be nice to see a pretty face. Not that you're not a handsome man, Doctor, but I kind of like her figure better.", "input": "", "output": "You have quite the sense of humor, Decker."}, {"instruction": "I try.", "input": "", "output": "Well, we're about out of time. Is there anything else you'd like to quickly discuss?"}, {"instruction": "Not that I can think of.", "input": "", "output": "All right then, I'll see you next week."}]
