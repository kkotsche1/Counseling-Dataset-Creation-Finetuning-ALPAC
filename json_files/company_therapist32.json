[{"instruction": "Mr...uh, Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. You must be Mr. Kurtz."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Thanks for seeing me. Is there...hmm. Is there a particular seat?", "input": "", "output": "Please sit anywhere you like."}, {"instruction": "You must do group therapy--all these chairs. Anyway, as I said on the phone, I'm looking for something fairly specific out of all this. I'm not looking for a long-term commitment.", "input": "", "output": "I see that makes you smile."}, {"instruction": "What? Oh. Well, commitment is why I'm here. I'm curious about why my relationships don't last for more than a few months. I've discussed it with friends, but they don't seem to have these issues. So I figured I can let SII pay to bounce things off you for a few weeks.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean \"these issues?\""}, {"instruction": "Dating. Or not dating, as the case may be. Most of my friends are in long-term relationships. I'm more of the three-months-and-out type.", "input": "", "output": "So you are with someone for three months and then?"}, {"instruction": "Out. They usually start getting a little weird, I say something to try and cool things down, and the next thing I know, my calls aren't getting returned.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, you say something to cool things down?"}, {"instruction": "This therapy thing is a little like talking to an echo, isn't it? Aren't you supposed to ask me about what I do and stuff?", "input": "", "output": "We're here to talk about whatever you want to talk about. But knowing what you do is good, too. You told me on the phone that you work for SII."}, {"instruction": "I'm an engineer. I've been with SII since graduation, and I interned here for the last two summers before that. I'm doing my MBA--SII's good about paying for grad school, if you want to do something they think will benefit the company. A lot of people are hanging in there until they get the degree. Then they go.", "input": "", "output": "Will you leave SII when you have your MBA?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? Wait. What we say here...this is a doctor-patient privilege thing, right?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Anything you say to me is covered by doctor-patient privilege, unless I thought you were either an imminent danger to yourself or to others."}, {"instruction": "Leaving SII would be about as far from harm as it gets. Yeah, when I have the degree I'm gone. That's fine; they get their pound of flesh while I'm on staff. I put in plenty of time!", "input": "", "output": "I would guess that being an engineer at a company like SII is quite a job."}, {"instruction": "They're all nuts. I do usability engineering--how to make our products easier for Joe Enduser to navigate. Talk about a no-win situation!", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "It's my job to make this stuff idiot-proof. But you have no idea of the caliber of idiots out there! If people would just apply two seconds' thought to some of these things. They don't read, they don't look at graphics, and they don't know how to use their computers. People are incredibly stupid, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "People often have difficulty understanding new concepts."}, {"instruction": "They aren't trying! This stuff isn't brain surgery. No wonder I'm not in a relationship. Most people just aren't able to keep up.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Now that's what I call therapy--one session and we're to the root of the problem. People are idiots.", "input": "", "output": "Mr. Kurtz, I think we may need to explore that idea a bit further. It's an interesting conclusion, but I'm not sure it's going to help matters."}, {"instruction": "I know. Typical. Logical statements make no headway in this world.", "input": "", "output": "Are the things you say to \"cool things down\" fairly logical?"}, {"instruction": "Of course they are.", "input": "", "output": "Can you tell me more?"}, {"instruction": "Well...there's really not much to them. I say...for instance, this last time, I told my girlfriend that she needed to get her act together. She'd been whining about switching jobs and getting a new apartment for two months. She hadn't done a thing to make that happen! I told her that I didn't want to hear any more whining. She got really upset and...boom. I get really sick of having to take care of people like that, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Boom?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she jumps out of bed and starts wailing. And we were in the middle of...uh, never mind. So I've got another ex to deal with.", "input": "", "output": "How do you mean, to deal with?"}, {"instruction": "I work on keeping in touch with my ex-girlfriends. I've got loans out to three of them, and I told one of them she could move into my spare room if she was tired of her current boyfriend.", "input": "", "output": "Has she moved in?"}, {"instruction": "No. But I offered! My ex--my current ex--got really pissed about that. But even my other ex, she just wants to whine about this guy she's with. Hey, I offered! But people are idiots. Situation reduces to the previous problem.", "input": "", "output": "You made the offer before your latest break-up?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. It's my house! And I make plenty of money. I'm doing better than everyone I know. That's why I'm doing this therapy. All my friends are flakes. They're in the arts and completely broke; I'm always paying for them. I can afford to get these things cleared up by a professional. I could afford this even if SII wasn't paying.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I figure I'm okay--I'm just fine. I'm basically looking for a way of dealing with these people. I get tired of investing time in these things and hearing the same garbage after three months.", "input": "", "output": "Mr. Kurtz, I can help you to discover patterns that may be occurring in these relationships. And I believe I can help you to break the patterns you choose to break."}, {"instruction": "I don't need fixing, Doctor. I need to figure out how to deal with these people. I'm obviously missing something important--some kind of cue that would let me know right off the bat who's insane. Because I clearly have some kind of maniac magnet.", "input": "", "output": "Maniac magnet?"}, {"instruction": "I attract these maniacs--these women who just can't cope.", "input": "", "output": "Let's work to get a handle on what the patterns may be. From there, you'll choose how to proceed. I'm not here to fix anyone; I help you to do the work on your own."}, {"instruction": "Fair enough. Let's see. We covered the situation at hand and you have the basics on my job. Anything else you need from me today?", "input": "", "output": "We can discuss anything you like."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Tell you what. We have a few minutes left, but I don't have anything on deck for you. Why don't I take off a bit early, and when we meet again I'll come in with a list of topics? That seems more efficient. At one hour once a week, I hate to waste your time or mine.", "input": "", "output": "If you'd like to come in next time with topics to discuss, that's fine. But I suggest you come in with just one as a starting point. Allowing discussion to unfold from there is usually more productive than trying to stick to an agenda. Tight scheduling tends to leave loose ends."}, {"instruction": "I hate loose ends. We definitely speak the same language here, Doctor. But we need to schedule our meetings, right?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Let's choose a weekly appointment time."}, {"instruction": "Do you know that SII has no female therapists on their list of recommended practitioners? Weird. You'd think that in this part of the world...", "input": "", "output": "If you're uncomfortable talking to me, I can write you a referral to another doctor."}, {"instruction": "No. No, this is fine. Let's see how this goes for now. Anyway, how does your schedule look? I prefer afternoons if that's convenient.", "input": "", "output": "This time is open next week.  Would you like to meet next Friday at three?"}, {"instruction": "Let me check. Sorry, I really live through this organizer. It'll just take a minute to boot up. Fridays are a good bet though. Yes, that works. See you next week, then?", "input": "", "output": "Next week it is."}, {"instruction": "I'm extremely busy today, Doctor Balis. I may need to leave early.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Mr. Kurtz. I understand that scheduling problems arise, but we cut our previous session a bit short. I think you'll find our time more productive if you can keep your schedule clear for our hour."}, {"instruction": "That's fine, but I'm in the middle of a damn firefight at work. I can't exactly drop everything for a meeting with you. Anyway, I'm here. Let's get to it.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, let's get started. I understand that a company like SII can impose some tight deadlines on projects."}, {"instruction": "This isn't a project deadline. This is politics. Somebody in the department is screwing with me, and I need to do some damage control.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "SII has just instituted this high-level management retreat. They select someone from each department and send them to the Bahamas for a fast-tracker event with Lloyd and some of the other heads of the company. It's a good opportunity to get yourself out there in front.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So apparently George--this is the usability unit's liaison--was supposed to be on top of this for our people. I heard about this on Monday morning.", "input": "", "output": "About the program?"}, {"instruction": "No, about my not being selected from the usability group. Apparently there was a big presentation on Friday, and the person from my group--for God's sake! George apparently just nominated the guy who's been in the department the longest. I'm screwed.", "input": "", "output": "So the person who is going on the retreat is someone who's been in the department longer than you have."}, {"instruction": "Exactly. Richard is an idiot--no concept of how to run the tests we do. Statistically unusable stuff. His reports are all anecdote and no facts. But he's been there for six years, so there you go.", "input": "", "output": "So you believe that the award was given strictly on the basis of seniority."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, that or he's Lloyd's new buddy. Maybe George figures if someone in the department is screwing the big guy--well, so much for me in that case.", "input": "", "output": "So you're currently regarding this as a fire that you have to fight?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, you've clearly never worked in an office before in your life. There's no way George can back out of this without losing face, but I'm going to damn well be on that trip next year. I think I've made that clear. And there may be an angle that will get me on the trip from another department. I'm doing some checking. But this isn't going to happen again. I'm looking into the nomination process and I'm drafting a memo on how George can improve it next year.", "input": "", "output": "Those are two ways of handling the situation. Have you talked with George? What did he say?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't talked to him. I want this all on paper.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Except the other-department angle. My assistant is looking into that.", "input": "", "output": "Your assistant is helping on this project?"}, {"instruction": "She's technically the group assistant, but no one else knows how to manage staff around there. Fairly common amongst engineers--no one wants to be the manager. Even George. Otherwise this wouldn't have happened.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So I was making some notes on the way over. I wanted to run some things by you that I've noticed over the past few relationships. Ideally we can narrow down this business and get to some strategies for weeding out the losers.", "input": "", "output": "Ah yes--the maniac magnet."}, {"instruction": "Good memory. Or are you keeping notes?", "input": "", "output": "I do keep confidential notes of all our sessions in your patient file. It helps me to see our progress and, as you put it, to work out strategies for making our time productive."}, {"instruction": "Patient? That's a funny word, Doctor. I'm not here to be treated for something. I explained to you why I'm here. I'm seeking your professional opinion on a situation.", "input": "", "output": "And I'm here to help you clarify that situation. The file helps me keep track of where we are in the process."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I may want to see these files one day. Anyway, the maniac magnet. Yes.", "input": "", "output": "I'd be interested in hearing your notes thus far, Mr. Kurtz. If you like I can even keep a copy on file. It may help us document the situation and your thoughts."}, {"instruction": "The notes are in my organizer. But I could print them out at some point.", "input": "", "output": "That would be good. Anyway, I am interested."}, {"instruction": "The first thing I noticed is that all the women in question have a problem with accepting advice. They're generally intelligent, but they don't go beyond a certain point.", "input": "", "output": "This is advice you're giving them that they aren't accepting?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. They don't have any problems telling me all about what's wrong. I'm a very good listener. Hell, I end up listening to them after they get new boyfriends. But they don't hear a thing I say. Doesn't matter what--career stuff, friends, money, whatever. They vent and then they do what they damn well please.", "input": "", "output": "And they're seeking advice in these conversations?"}, {"instruction": "I see things more clearly than they do. I'm only telling them how things are and what they can do to make things better. Anyway, that's item one. Item two--something about these women makes them afraid, or something, to better themselves. Or it may be that they just don't know what they want. Even the most career-driven ones get sidetracked, and even the ones who say they want what I want...", "input": "", "output": "And what do you want?"}, {"instruction": "Family, house, money--the usual. But none of them do the things you have to do to get those things.", "input": "", "output": "What do you have to do to get those things?"}, {"instruction": "Get your act together! Grow up! Get a real job! Get a real place to live! I've already ruled out seeing anyone with roommates, by the way. I'm not dating anyone who still lives like they're back in the dorms. I'm not going back to anyone's place and finding their roommate's dirty laundry all over the bathroom. What is it about women living together that makes them so messy?", "input": "", "output": "Mr. Kurtz, may I ask something about the women you date? Is there an age range, generally speaking?"}, {"instruction": "I usually date women my age or younger. I see where you're going, Doctor. It's not like they're just starting out. And it doesn't take that much initiative to afford a decent apartment.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's funny about the messiness. Most of them do just fine when they're in my apartment. I've had girlfriends that cleaned my apartment and still went back home to complete disasters. I think that most of them just appreciated being in a nice place. But they could try harder to pull themselves together, wouldn't you think?", "input": "", "output": "People often have different priorities for different parts of their lives."}, {"instruction": "That's part of the problem, isn't it? Set a priority and act accordingly. How hard can that be?", "input": "", "output": "Are there any more observations on your list?"}, {"instruction": "Not yet. Like I said, I've had other things to think about. But this seems like a start. Preliminary thoughts, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I think it's good for you to continue your list. I'd like to suggest, though, that you add a second set of observations. As you pick out these patterns, I'd like you to note your own reactions to each situation, as it happened."}, {"instruction": "Why?", "input": "", "output": "If you're seeking patterns, it's good to have the context for each event."}, {"instruction": "That's what I'm saying. That's why I'm here. My responses have been very logical in every case.", "input": "", "output": "But every case will be different, since every person is different. And your reactions may differ subtly--after all, you'd be responding to different words, from different people, and in different circumstances. The fuller the picture we have of each occurrence, the better we'll be able to tease out a pattern. And as patterns develop, it will be easier to work backward and find what these incidents have in common."}, {"instruction": "Oh. Well, that makes sense.", "input": "", "output": "I believe in this case you're seeking anecdotal evidence."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well, thank you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome. Speaking of data-gathering, how long have you been dating?"}, {"instruction": "Since college. On and off since then. After I moved to San Francisco in 1993, I was tightly focused on work for the first year or so, and there wasn't time to meet people. SII was in a mess; they needed me to get them up to speed.", "input": "", "output": "So you're not from the area?"}, {"instruction": "I am. I grew up in Marin County and I did my undergrad at Berkeley. I was talking to Bill and Larry after that, but SII was hot for me after seeing my internships and made the move worthwhile. There just aren't many people who can do what I do.", "input": "", "output": "Bill and Larry?"}, {"instruction": "Gates. Ellison. Microsoft and Oracle. They were offering a bundle, too--great stock options. But my visibility would have been nothing. At a place like SII, I can move fairly fast, and then go into a senior position with all the perks after I have the MBA.", "input": "", "output": "Is your family still in the area?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I see them a few times a year. There's not much up there that's interesting to me, but they're always glad to have me home. I was on the phone with my father quite a bit a few months ago getting him set up on e-mail. I told him that that was the best way to reach me, generally speaking, so they trotted out and bought a computer.", "input": "", "output": "So you were talking him through the process of using his e-mail, I take it?"}, {"instruction": "Hand-holding. Same as work. I finally called my sister and told her to get up there and put it together. Told her she could earn her keep. I send her an allowance each month at school; I figure this is fair payback.", "input": "", "output": "I take it your sister's in school in the area."}, {"instruction": "No, she's at Reed, up in Portland. But she has her car and she had two weeks between the end of school and her job up there.", "input": "", "output": "Quite a drive."}, {"instruction": "Well, I took her out to dinner when she got into the city. We needed to discuss her major. Reed is a liberal-arts college, as you probably know.", "input": "", "output": "Yes. An excellent one as I understand it."}, {"instruction": "She'll be the best-educated burger-flipper at McDonald's. What do you do with a degree in philosophy?", "input": "", "output": "What was your degree in?"}, {"instruction": "Computer science. One trip to the career center and it's not too hard to figure out the major to have in this economy.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, we're sidetracked. And I need to go back to the office.", "input": "", "output": "We have a few minutes left, Mr. Kurtz. I'd like to give you another item to consider during the week, as you develop the list and your observations."}, {"instruction": "It's a very busy time right now, Doctor, as I said. I really should be out of here.", "input": "", "output": "We're almost done. As you work out your list, it will be helpful to have collateral notes on where you met your girlfriends and how the relationships began. Sometimes the seeds of trouble are sown early."}, {"instruction": "All right. And now I'm leaving. Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Same time next week, Mr. Kurtz?"}, {"instruction": "Assuming nothing is happening at work.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Mr. Kurtz. See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, I presume.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Mr. Kurtz. It's good to see you this week. But I would have appreciated some notice last week."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I'm sorry about that. I actually meant to come in. Quite a bit has happened since I've talked to you, though--lots of good changes.", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be in an excellent mood today."}, {"instruction": "Yes. They've just promoted my assistant. It's going to be inconvenient for me, but having one of my own move up in the department...well, it's good in the long run.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like good news for her."}, {"instruction": "Certainly. She'll be a junior researcher now. As a matter of fact, it's not much of a stretch at all; I've been having her do a lot of my legwork for several months. The title only makes it official. It will actually cut down on her workload--once she's trained her successor, she can focus on the research portion of what she's already doing.", "input": "", "output": "This is the woman who has been the group's assistant?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes. She interned with us for two summers and has been working here for about a year since graduation. It's very much like my career path, as far as that goes. I'm not thrilled at the idea of dealing with a new assistant, but as long as the training is included in Susan's new responsibilities, I suppose I'll manage. Maybe I can even task her with some of the things that Susan wasn't handling. I should confirm with George that I'm available to interview the candidates when they start coming in.", "input": "", "output": "Last week you mentioned that your assistant was helping you to research a department award. Is this the same person?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, that's her. That's an excellent point. I need to make sure she wraps that up before she gets started on her new responsibilities. Funny you mention that. I noticed earlier in the week that she was spending a lot of time in George's office with the doors closed. I'd explained to her that our little project wasn't for George's ears, so I admit I was a little concerned to see her spending so much time in there. This explains it all.", "input": "", "output": "Susan will still be working in the section that George supervises. Is George the supervisor for the entire Usability lab?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. As the group's assistant, she has always technically reported to George, but now it's more direct. I don't have direct responsibility for her now.", "input": "", "output": "So Susan is moving from being your assistant to being your colleague."}, {"instruction": "I wouldn't go that far. She's still a junior member of the team. And since she was my assistant, I expect a bit of a boost out of it myself. All boats rise with the tide, as they say. I'm taking her to dinner tonight to celebrate.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like a friendly thing to do."}, {"instruction": "Well, we're definitely friendly. Now that she's no longer just on the support staff, we can...well, we've eaten enough late dinners in the office I think. And I think this may just take care of our little problem too, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "How do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I know this girl very well. She's level-headed and a real go-getter. Perfect girlfriend material, wouldn't you say? I figure we go out somewhere quiet tonight and...well, celebrate. Probably somewhere quiet in the city. I don't think we need to let this be known around SII just yet.", "input": "", "output": "Mr. Kurtz, have you discussed this with her? It sounds like you're interested in moving beyond a purely professional relationship with Susan."}, {"instruction": "Well, sure. Now that she's not just a staff secretary...and understand that it's not such a stigma at SII as it might be elsewhere. There's a lot of interoffice dating in our industry. A lot of smart people who want to see other smart people. We tend to understand each other's schedules and what we're talking about when we talk about work.", "input": "", "output": "So I've heard. But my question is whether you and Susan have an understanding, I suppose. I don't have to tell you that dating in the workplace is fraught with peril in the 90s."}, {"instruction": "That's what I'm telling you, Dr. Balis. I know her very well. She's entirely sane. What are you getting at?", "input": "", "output": "I was explaining..."}, {"instruction": "Are you accusing me of some kind of sexual harassment, Dr. Balis?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not accusing you, but I'm pointing out that it's an issue, Mr. Kurtz, of which you should be aware. If you and Susan haven't..."}, {"instruction": "I can't believe this! Who the hell do you think you are? Who the hell do you think you're talking to?", "input": "", "output": "Mr. Kurtz, sit down."}, {"instruction": "Fuck you. Fuck you, Balis.", "input": "", "output": "You're angry, Mr. Kurtz. But it's in your best interest to consider the many facets of this situation you're entering into."}, {"instruction": "You don't know what you're talking about.", "input": "", "output": "Mr. Kurtz, if you're wrong about what Susan's intentions are, you could be opening yourself up to risk--career-endangering risk. Are you willing to risk your career for this?"}, {"instruction": "This...this is not a career risk. This is my assistant. This is someone I've been working with since she was a college intern. This is not some ball-busting feminist. She wants this promotion and she wants to make a career for herself at SII. And to answer your question, as a matter of fact, I have excellent reason to think she's as interested in pursuing this as I am. You!  You in your office here, sitting around waiting for people to come whining about whatever. You don't know what a high-pressure job is like. We work together, Dr. Balis, we work together and we spend ten, twelve, fourteen hours a day sometimes in the office together. You think I don't see her enough to know what's going on here?", "input": "", "output": "I believe you came to me to ask my advice on this very topic."}, {"instruction": "I came in to ask your professional advice to sort out the weirdos, the unstable ones. But I've had months, years of time to observe her. I know her. I hear about her life and her friends and her weekends. I know plenty about her. And I know how she acts around me. I don't need your advice, Doctor Balis. I have empirical evidence. I have observations and data, Doctor. If I wanted a system, this is as good as it gets.", "input": "", "output": "If you wanted a system. Mr. Kurtz, the question we've left unasked is whether the scientific method applies in matters of the heart. You've been working to increase your understanding of what's happening in your life, and that's a worthy goal. But the question that's been left unexamined is how these insights can be best applied."}, {"instruction": "Look, I need to cut this short. I told Susan I wanted to speak with her at the end of the day. That's when I'm asking her to dinner.", "input": "", "output": "So you haven't asked her yet."}, {"instruction": "That's end-of-day stuff. That's another thing: I know the difference between the office and my personal life. Your accusations are completely off-base, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "I hope that everything works out for the best, Mr. Kurtz. And I'd suggest that you have time to think this over carefully. There's no hurry; congratulations and even dinner could certainly take place next week."}, {"instruction": "I am having dinner with Susan tonight, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "In any case let's schedule our next appointment. Same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so, Doctor. I explained to you that our mission is accomplished. I don't see any need to continue this process.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Well, Mr. Kurtz, I must admit that I'm curious to see if this approach works, and as I said, I sincerely hope you're right in this. I do suggest that a follow up meeting is in order."}, {"instruction": "I'll call you to schedule. I'm not committing to anything here and now. Goodbye, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Have a good weekend, Mr. Kurtz."}]
