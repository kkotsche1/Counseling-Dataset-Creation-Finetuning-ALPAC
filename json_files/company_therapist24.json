[{"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Thanks for seeing me.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Mr. Trent, you're welcome. May I ask what's so funny though?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, Doctor Balis. I guess I was expecting Doctor Katz from the TV show.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Trent. However, if I start to squiggle please let me know."}, {"instruction": "Okay, it's a deal. It's good to know you have a sense of humor. I tend to make jokes when I get nervous. Should I just sit anywhere? And please, call me Jesse or JT.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks.  Please sit anywhere you feel comfortable, Jesse."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Certainly. Now, you said on the phone you were having a difficult time because of something that happened to your wife. Why don't you start by giving me some background on the two of you?"}, {"instruction": "I guess background is as good a place to start as any. Hmm...okay, Maddie--my wife--and I met through a group of mutual friends when she was twenty and I was twenty-two. She was smart, cute, sassy, and I fell for her fast--a once in a lifetime whirlwind romance, you know? It was really great. Too bad things had to change.", "input": "", "output": "Everything changes, Jesse. We have to figure out what has changed for you and work from there."}, {"instruction": "That's just it Doctor Balis! I know what has changed!", "input": "", "output": "Okay. You were telling me about Maddie, why don't you continue?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, okay. We had been dating for about five months when Maddie became pregnant. I knew I loved Maddie and wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, so I wasn't upset when we found out. Neither was she, really. Other than telling our parents about it, we were both actually comfortable with the idea. We decided to drop the bomb at Christmas--very bad mistake. None of our parents were happy. That's an understatement. They went ballistic. Her parents accused me of forcing myself on their daughter and \"disgracing\" her. My parents were convinced--and they still are--that Maddie did it intentionally to snag a man to take care of her. Which, of course, couldn't be further from the truth! Maddie was the one going to college, and I was a generation X slug.", "input": "", "output": "So neither of your parents were happy. What did you two decide to do?"}, {"instruction": "Neither of us lived at home, so that made it easy to ignore them. Maddie and I decided to get married. Not just because she was pregnant, but because we really loved each other. Things were great for the first few months. Our parents even gave in a little. I guess they figured the situation wasn't going away.", "input": "", "output": "Many parents overreact to news of an unplanned pregnancy. Most parents tend to warm up to the idea eventually. Yours started coming around?"}, {"instruction": "Hardly! Well, at first we were naive and just happy they seemed to be warming up. Now, I think they felt they could do more damage by being around. Sheesh! We finally realized that no matter what either of us did, it would never be good enough for the other's parents. However, for a while there, it did go okay. Then there was the accident. That was when we knew for sure we could never count on them to support our marriage.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about the accident, Jesse."}, {"instruction": "Okay. One day when Maddie was seven months pregnant, we went to Greensfelder Park for a picnic. By the way, Maddie and I are originally from St. Louis. Things were going great for us. An ultrasound a month earlier told us the baby was healthy, and they were pretty sure it was a girl. We were on top of the world. Maddie said she wanted to drive. She always loved to drive, but what with being pregnant, she didn't always feel like it. However on this day, she did. We were driving along, laughing, planning, talking about baby names. Then a car full of kids ran a stop sign and smashed into the driver's side of the car! It was horrible!", "input": "", "output": "Just take a moment, Jesse, and let me know when you are ready, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis. This is kind of hard. I haven't talked about it in years. It was a very bad accident. Maddie almost died. I'm amazed to this day that she even lived through it. However, she lost the baby. I just broke an arm and had a concussion. Her parents blamed me. They felt that I should have been driving not Maddie. My parents blamed her. They thought Maddie had been careless. So, as far as the parents went, we were right back to square one. I don't understand why they have to be that way. I mean we lost our child! It was the fault of the kids that hit us. We had the right of way. Christ! Sometimes, it's so hard to believe that Maddie and I are related to these people!", "input": "", "output": "The loss of a child is very traumatic. Your parents should have been more supportive. How did you and Maddie cope with the loss?"}, {"instruction": "It was awful at first. I kept having nightmares. Maddie cried all the time. But we were there for each other. She would wake me if I was having a nightmare. I would hold her and let her cry. We were both angry at the world, but never with each other. It eventually got easier. We kept busy with school and work. It's sad that it happened, but it did make our marriage stronger. Maddie and I eventually realized that we just had to go on. And that's what we did.", "input": "", "output": "It's good to hear that you leaned on each other to cope in this situation. Many people draw into themselves and their own pain, forgetting that they aren't the only ones involved. That can be hard on a marriage."}, {"instruction": "So I'm now finding out.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Jesse. Let's talk about how things have changed."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, might as well. That's why I'm here after all. After the accident, life went on. Maddie graduated from college. She is a computer nut. I'd taken some classes in photography and was working for a portrait studio. Maddie went to work as a graphic designer for a company in St. Louis. It was great as long as we avoided each others' parents. We had been married for three years and were still very much in love, to our parents' dismay. Maddie got bored with her job, though. She's great at what she does, but the company she was working for was small and the pay wasn't great. So we talked about it and decided she should look elsewhere. She sent her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to probably fifty different places. We kind of thought that because she'd only been working in the field a year, she wouldn't get many responses. We were wrong. So we went through the offers, and SII made the best one. So we packed our things and moved here just over a year ago.", "input": "", "output": "San Francisco is an interesting city. Were you happy with the move?"}, {"instruction": "At first. No parents or siblings around, making new friends, exploring the city--it was really great. Plus, Maddie really loved her job at SII. She found it very challenging and rewarding. SII is great about not chaining their employees to a desk. If she came in and finished her work early, she was free to go. I spent the first few months just wandering around. I'd had enough of taking fake looking photographs at weddings. I found a used bookstore one day. I went there every day for a week. Then the owner asked me if I was possibly looking for a job. I told him sure, and he hired me that day! It's a wonderful place to work--I read all day long. The pay isn't great, but Maddie makes more than enough to keep us comfortable.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds as if you both adjusted very well."}, {"instruction": "Yes. It was good for us until about six weeks ago.", "input": "", "output": "What happened then?"}, {"instruction": "Okay...sorry. I just haven't really talked about what happened much. Okay, about six weeks ago, I flew back home to St. Louis. It was my parents' thirtieth wedding anniversary. I may not always agree with them, but they are my parents. For a marriage to survive thirty years is something close to a miracle. Maddie had a deadline at work that Monday--she had been sick with the flu and was behind on her work. She wasn't planning on going to the party anyway, but wanted to go just to see her friends. But at the last minute, she decided to stay home and get her work done for Monday.", "input": "", "output": "Did your visit home go well?"}, {"instruction": "The visit itself was fine. Good party. My parents seemed happy. Then I got a phone call from the SFPD Sunday morning around 4 am St. Louis time.They informed me that my wife had been attacked and raped, and she was being taken to the hospital. They asked that I return as soon as I could. I got the next flight out and, because of the time difference, was back by 7 am. I went straight to the hospital. Maddie was sedated. There was a detective there keeping an eye on her and waiting for me, I guess. He informed me that Maddie was stable and was expected to recover. I asked him what happened, and he said that Maddie was taking a shower around ten-thirty, which is usual. Someone then broke into the apartment. He waited for her to get out of the shower and attacked her when she went into our room. He beat her up pretty badly and raped her three times before the bastard finally left her alone. He put a pillow over her face to muffle her screams. Maddie passed out during the third attack. The police suspect that he thought he had killed her and took off. Maddie woke up and listened for him. When she was sure he was gone, she called the police.", "input": "", "output": "Have the police caught the man that did this?"}, {"instruction": "No, not yet. They have a few suspects though. I wish they'd catch him if only to allow Maddie to get her life back. She has become so angry and bitter, and I fully understand--I feel the same way.", "input": "", "output": "It's natural to be angry. How is Maddie doing now?"}, {"instruction": "Physically, she has recovered. Mentally, she's a wreck. She's in therapy now, so I hope that helps her some. She's become very distant from me, though. Never in our marriage have I seen her like this.", "input": "", "output": "Jesse, rape causes a complex set of emotional reactions. Maddie is going through quite a bit. Many women feel dirty or disgusting after a rape. My best advice is probably that you make it clear to her that you don't think it was her fault and that it hasn't changed the way you feel about her.  Let her know that you are there for her and are willing to talk and to listen."}, {"instruction": "Trust me, Doc, she knows she isn't to blame. I'm not so sure she feels the same about me, though.", "input": "", "output": "Jesse, your emotions and reactions are going to be complex as well. I'd like you to try to keep a journal about your thoughts and feelings on the rape. You can share it with me if you like, or keep it private. Would you do that?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, I love to write. Maybe it will help me focus. Doctor Balis, I feel exhausted. This therapy thing is hard work. Are we getting close to a good place to end?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Jesse, our time is almost up. Do you want to end now?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, please.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Is this a good time of day for you?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. I set my own schedule at work, so any time works for me.", "input": "", "output": "Same time next week then. Let's see, that's Monday, November 3rd at 2 pm. And work on the journal--you may find it helps you a lot."}, {"instruction": "Thanks so much, Doctor. I'll see you.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Jesse. See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I'm sorry about that. My scooter decided to foul a plug.", "input": "", "output": "Scooter? Like a little Honda?"}, {"instruction": "None of that plastic stuff for me, Doc! I ride a vintage Italian Vespa Scooter. A 1966 Super Sport 180, to be exact. Beautiful pieces of steel. A monster to maintain, however!", "input": "", "output": "I bet the hills around here aren't very kind to it."}, {"instruction": "Doesn't do too badly. Missouri is full of hills, and I used to ride it all of the time. I even belonged to a scooter club back home.", "input": "", "output": "Interesting. I didn't realize they were that popular. How long have you been riding?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I got my first Vespa just after our second wedding anniversary. It was a belated gift from Maddie. So, it's been almost four years. I can't get Maddie to ride, though--she says she's a four wheeled kind of gal. The one time I did get her to ride with me, we ran out of gas and got stranded. That kind of ruined it for her.", "input": "", "output": "I can see how that might have bothered her. So how has Maddie been doing?"}, {"instruction": "Hard to say. She's still really distant. I did follow your advice and let her know that I'm there for her.", "input": "", "output": "How did that go?"}, {"instruction": "At first, I thought it was going well. She actually let me hold her hand when we first started talking. The more I talked though, the tenser she became. By the time I was done talking, she'd moved across the room. It's just so damn frustrating!", "input": "", "output": "It's going to take time for her to deal with her anger, Jesse. Even though it didn't go well, you still did the right thing in the long run. Did Maddie have anything to say?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Basically she thinks I should have stayed home with her that weekend. She didn't want me to go. Maddie begged me all day Thursday to cancel the trip and stay with her. She gets pretty bent whenever I see my parents, like they are really going to say anything to change my mind about Maddie. Christ, we've been married for five years, you'd think that would give her a little bit of confidence!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, I don't want to sound like an insensitive asshole, but Maddie is a big girl! I never thought anything like this would happen to her. Trust me, if I could go back and make the choice again, of course I would stay home. But I know I can't beat myself up for something I can't change.", "input": "", "output": "It's true that you can't change the past, Jesse. Maddie needs to blame someone right now. Since they haven't caught the rapist yet, perhaps she sees you as the next logical choice. Did she say anything else?"}, {"instruction": "Just some mean stuff about how I should be a \"real man.\" She said that she earns all of our money while I sit in a used bookstore all day. That I should have done something with myself--\"stop being a kid and grow up.\" She told me how foolish I look riding my \"girlie little scooter.\" She just started spouting crap like that.", "input": "", "output": "And how did you react to her?"}, {"instruction": "How did I react? I just sat there and took it like a good little husband. Everyone keeps telling me to just let her vent--be understanding, listen to her, give her time, let her work through her anger, blah blah blah fucking blah. Oh sorry, Doctor Balis, I should watch my language.", "input": "", "output": "It's quite all right, Jesse. You don't have to worry about offending me. My office is a safety zone. You don't have to watch your language or repress anything you're feeling. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It's just that...Christ, doesn't anyone care about what I'm going through? Yeah, it happened to Maddie. But don't people understand that it rips my soul out every damn time I think about it? That bastard broke into my home and destroyed the only thing in this world I've ever loved! Doctor, I'm trying so hard to be there for my wife, to help her, and to love her. How can I do that when she acts like I'm the one that raped her? I didn't do anything. I didn't ask for this anymore than she did!", "input": "", "output": "Here's a Kleenex, Jesse. You have every right to be angry. There's always an outpouring of sympathy for the victim. People often forget about the anger, guilt, and frustration a husband or boyfriend feels in these situations. When you feel ready to continue, I'm curious as to how your families are dealing with the rape."}, {"instruction": "Thanks for the tissue, Doc. Okay, the families...well, that's another nightmare.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "It's like the accident all over again, that's how! I'm not even talking to my parents anymore--fake bunch of assholes. They acted sympathetic at first, calling me and asking me how she was doing. Then my sister, Sarah--who doesn't get along with them either--told me last week that the general consensus was that Maddie was a big tramp and must have asked for this. The rapist broke into our apartment--and she must have asked for it!  Maddie is a jeans and an oversized t-shirt kind of girl. They act as if she dresses like a whore. I confronted my parents about what Sarah said and they denied it. But why would Sarah lie? Sarah and Maddie are great friends. My parents said it must have been \"that man\"--Sarah's husband Darrell--that said it. He's black and they're a judgmental bunch of bigots! So, I stopped talking to them and put them on call block.", "input": "", "output": "What about Maddie's parents?"}, {"instruction": "They just feed into her resentment of me. They were against us moving to San Francisco anyway. They consider it to be a \"morally corrupt and deviant city.\" They're pretty judgmental and bigoted, too. They blame me for leaving her alone in a city of freaks. Like they don't have rapists in St. Louis. They're trying to talk her into moving back home without me. The only thing that gives me hope is that she flat out told them no.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel they are trying to manipulate Maddie?"}, {"instruction": "Always. Like I said, same thing as the accident--they want to lay blame when blame isn't the issue.", "input": "", "output": "I agree that blame is not the issue. How does Maddie deal with her parents' manipulations?"}, {"instruction": "Well, to be honest, Maddie can manipulate with the best of them. She learned it from them, I guess. For the most part, she takes her calls out of the room. But sometime I hear her talking to them or to her best friend Sammy about them. Maddie still resents the way they've treated our marriage. So even though I think she basically agrees with them and puts the blame on me and the city, she disagrees with them out of spite.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe it isn't spite, Jesse. Maybe in her heart, she knows you're not to blame for the rape. Have you ever thought of it like that?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Sammy says the same thing. She calls me to see how I'm doing. She's the only one giving me a second thought in this mess.", "input": "", "output": "What's Sammy's opinion on all of this?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she's Maddie's friend first and foremost. They've known each other since they were twelve. We've always gotten along great. She tries to help Maddie. Sammy has always been there for Maddie and for me, too. She's worried about Maddie, but doesn't want to say too much to push her right now.", "input": "", "output": "It's good that you both have a caring friend. Do you have any friends you can talk to?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I have a lot of casual acquaintances. Most of our old St. Louis friends just wanted to party and live it up, so we kind of lost track of a lot of them after the move. We didn't really mind, we had each other. Now, we're starting over in a new city. I've met some people from the local scooter scene, but they aren't people I can talk to about this. The friends I do have from back home just wouldn't understand. I guess that's why I decided to come here. I needed to get some of this off of my chest. My boss, Jack, suggested I see a shrink. Oh sorry, I mean a therapist.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, Jesse. I've been called worse. Have you told Maddie about our sessions?"}, {"instruction": "No, not yet. I'm afraid she'll see it as me being selfish, you know?", "input": "", "output": "You think she will view you getting help as selfish?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I guess she'll feel like that because I should be focusing on her now and not worrying about myself.", "input": "", "output": "You have every right to seek help, Jesse. Did you say that Maddie was in therapy?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. She's in therapy too. And I know I have the right, but I'm not so sure that's how she'd take it. She also started going to the Rape Crisis Center support group meetings. She's gone five times in the last week or so.", "input": "", "output": "Does it seem to be helping her?"}, {"instruction": "Hard to tell. I see her less and less these days. She goes to work, comes home, and eats. If I'm lucky, she says hi to me, and then she's out the door to therapy or the crisis center. I heard her talking to Sammy about taking a women's self-defense class, too. When she gets home, she goes straight to bed.", "input": "", "output": "Jesse, am I correct to assume that you and Maddie haven't had sexual relations since the rape?"}, {"instruction": "You would assume correctly, my dear Watson! I know it's normal after a rape, and I would never rush her before she's ready. And it's not one of those \"I'm a man and have needs, too\" type things either. I can live without sex. What bothers me the most is that after we lost the baby, I would hold her for hours, just stroking her hair, comforting her. It felt good to know she found safety in my arms. Now, I can't even do that for her, because if I even get close to her, she gets tense and shuts down.", "input": "", "output": "It takes time to come to terms with a rape. Rape is a violation of power. Give her some time, and if she does come to you, make sure you put your own feelings aside for that moment. There will come a time when she feels safe with you again. Are the police any closer to a suspect yet?"}, {"instruction": "I love her, Doctor Balis, and will give her whatever she needs, no matter what. As for a suspect, I haven't heard anything. That pretty much tells me they are still stumped.", "input": "", "output": "I do hope they catch him.  Not only will a vicious criminal be off the streets, of course, but it will do a lot towards allowing your wife to heal. Did you take my advice about the journal?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I usually write after Maddie takes off out the door. I'm not used to her being gone so much, so I guess it helps ease my loneliness. I haven't decided if I want you to read it or not--there's stuff in there about you, too.", "input": "", "output": "The journal is to help you sort through things in between sessions. I would be glad to read it if you want me to, although I certainly understand if you don't."}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it. Is it time, Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, our time's up. Same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "Sounds peachy. Maybe I'll have my scoot running better by then.", "input": "", "output": "Good luck with the bike, Jesse. See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor Balis. Same old, same old.", "input": "", "output": "Have a seat. I take it things are not improving at home, Jesse?"}, {"instruction": "I see why we pay you the big bucks, Doc! Just a joke. I don't get to do much joking lately, and since I get to bend your ear for an hour a week, I figure I can torture you with my humor.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Jesse, that's all the time we have for today."}, {"instruction": "Doctor! Shame on you!", "input": "", "output": "How are things, Jesse?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. I guess I can't sit here and joke the whole hour, hmm? Maddie is still shutting me out. It's getting more difficult to deal with. The more time she spends with her support group, the more she seems to hate me.", "input": "", "output": "How much time is she spending with her rape support group?"}, {"instruction": "A couple of hours almost every other day. If she isn't at therapy or working late, she's with people from her support group. I just...I don't know. I'm glad Maddie is seeking help dealing with what's she is going through, but I...damn...I just can't understand why she won't lean on me for some support!", "input": "", "output": "Rape is a very difficult trauma to get over, Jesse. Some find talking to others that have lived through it helpful. However, I do agree that she should also view you as a source of support. Why do you feel that the group is contributing to her negative attitude towards you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, one day I went up to the Center to see if I could find Maddie. I wanted to try to talk to her and see what the Center was all about, you know? I thought I might even sit in on a session if they would let me. I don't know what made me think that!", "input": "", "output": "What happened when you went to the Center?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, the looks I got made me feel like I was a rapist! If looks could kill, I'm sure I would have been six feet under right now. And please, don't think I'm belittling the Center. I know they do great work and help plenty of women who need it. And I don't really think it's the counselors there either. The one I did talk to was very nice and helpful. The looks I got were from the women who were there for the group session. Maddie saw me and about had a cow right there on the spot! She was furious, accused me of following her. What crap! I tried to tell her that I just wanted to see her, but one of her support buddies came and dragged her off to the bathroom. Another one came up and told me I should just stay out of things that don't concern me! Can you believe that shit? Maddie is my concern!", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Maddie is your concern. But many of these women are in terrible pain and find trusting anyone difficult. Plus, if Maddie has been venting her feelings about you in the group, that could have led to a bias against you. Did Maddie have anything to say to you about this incident later ?"}, {"instruction": "She was pissed. She got home pretty late that night, but I waited up for her. She ignored me at first, slamming things around in the kitchen, being pissed off. I went in to try to talk to her, but all we did was argue. She said I had no business going to the Center to check up on her. I said that I was worried about her and that I was trying to help. She said she didn't need or want my help. That hurt me so badly. I just don't understand how we even got this bad, Doc. I finally just said that whatever she wanted was fine with me--trying to be the ever sensitive and understanding husband. Then I went to bed.", "input": "", "output": "So you feel it's not the Center or the counselors but the other women in the group that are encouraging Maddie to shut you out?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's it exactly. I think that some of the women may have formed their own little group. After Maddie accused me of following her, I decided that maybe I should follow her. So the next night, I borrowed a friend's car and waited for her to go out. She ended up at some house. I sat outside for a little while, and then another car with three more women showed up, including the one that told me that Maddie was none of my concern.", "input": "", "output": "And you feel they were having a private meeting of their own?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm pretty sure they weren't there for a quilting bee, Doc!", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I went back home and called the counselor I talked to the night before at the Center. I asked her if it was typical for the women in the groups to have outside meetings. She kind of dodged around that question, but eventually told me that it does sometimes happen, but the Center doesn't encourage it because there's no mediator present.", "input": "", "output": "I would have to agree with that. It's good that the women have found a source of support in each other, but there's a lot of anger and feelings of powerlessness after a rape. Without mediation, there's a temptation for the women to feed off of each other's anger. Mediation is needed to help everyone keep their feelings in perspective. The energy from the anger can feel very powerful, but often ends up being more destructive in the end. Did you confront Maddie about the meeting?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'm not totally stupid, Doctor. That would surely have been a suicide for my marriage. I just kept quiet. I wanted to get some perspective on the situation. I miss her so much, I can't even begin to tell you what it's like to watch her going through this. I love her with everything that I am, and I am not just saying that. I mean it. She is my whole life. I wish they would hurry up and catch this bastard.", "input": "", "output": "Have the police made any progress?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of. There was another rape in our apartment building. It happened last Monday night. Maddie freaked really bad when she heard about it. The police are beginning to think it's someone that lives in the building. It's a secured building, so no one can get in without a key. They are currently checking out everyone who has lived there in the last year. Hopefully, they'll catch this asshole soon before he can destroy more lives.", "input": "", "output": "I hope their search turns up something. I think that Maddie will benefit greatly knowing that the man that raped her is behind bars. It may also turn her anger away from you and towards her rapist."}, {"instruction": "I hope you're right. I'm growing very tired of being the bad guy here. I'm worried about her though, Doc. She hasn't been eating very well. She's also getting sick a lot. I'm afraid she's picked up a few ulcers over this whole mess. I think she has a doctor's appointment tomorrow--there was a cryptic notation on the desk calendar. She's usually pretty good about taking care of herself.", "input": "", "output": "She's under a lot of stress right now; I'm glad she's going to get a check up.  Jesse, I'm curious about how you and Maddie had been getting along in the months prior to the rape. Were there any conflicts or problems that could also be contributing to Maddie's attitude towards you now?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. You know, I've been thinking about that a lot myself. We were doing fine for the most part. Adjusting to a new city can be exciting and frightening, as I'm sure you know. It was pretty cool, though. The night life here is great. Lots of great bands come here that never stopped in St. Louis. And Maddie loves the ocean, so that is great, too.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you were having fun here. However, I sense that there was something going on with you and Maddie. Am I correct?"}, {"instruction": "Right as rain again, Doc. You should get yourself a night job on the Psychic Friends Network!", "input": "", "output": "I think I'll stick with my day job for now, but I'll keep it in mind. Now, tell me what was going on between you and Maddie."}, {"instruction": "Well, it was that old biological clock thing, Doc. Maddie will be twenty-six very soon. After we lost the first baby, we decided that Maddie should finish school and get her career going before we tried again. Now here we are--she finished school and has her career. And now she wants a baby.", "input": "", "output": "And how did you feel about a baby?"}, {"instruction": "I was all for the idea. I love kids! I sometimes act a lot like one, so I can relate on their level--just joking. I can't wait to be a father, but that doesn't change the fact that it just isn't that simple.", "input": "", "output": "Were you having problems conceiving?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if \"problem\" is exactly the right word. We both went and had our physicals about eight months ago, just to make sure everything was in good working order, you know? We both got clean bills of health. But her eggs and my spermies just didn't seem to want to play with each other, though! We tried, and tried, and tried. Every month, another disappointing period showed up right on schedule. At first, it was kind of fun. I mean, what man is going to balk at sex every night? Then, Maddie heard that a lot of sex wasn't the way to go about it. So we tried having sex just around her ovulation time. Before I knew it, sex became almost like a chore or duty, and not just to me either. I'm pretty sure Maddie was feeling the same way. I even had some performance problems there towards the end. After five months of trying, Maddie was more frustrated than ever. And she was less than understanding about my problems. We finally decided to give up actively trying to have a baby. I figure if it's going to happen, it will. It happened once already, and we sure weren't trying then!", "input": "", "output": "How did Maddie feel about giving up and letting nature take it course?"}, {"instruction": "She wasn't thrilled, that's for sure. But there was nothing either of us could do really. Her mom is constantly bugging her for a grandchild. Like that old bat doesn't have three other grandchildren already.", "input": "", "output": "Maddie is still really young and has plenty of childbearing years ahead of her. Trying to conceive can be very hard on a couple. What you and Maddie were going through is not rare at all. There are plenty of couples who are perfectly capable of conceiving and have problems doing so--and five months isn't even really long enough to call a problem yet. Do you remember the last time you and Maddie had a sexual encounter?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor! I don't kiss and tell.", "input": "", "output": "Jesse, if you do not want to tell me, that's perfectly fine."}, {"instruction": "Gee, Doc, I'm just teasing you! I know exactly when it was. It's etched in my mind, because I'm now afraid it was the very last time we will every make love! It was the morning that I left, the day before the rape. Maddie was trying to entice me to stay home with her. She said we could practice making babies. The thought of that did make it hard for me to leave! If only I had stayed home and practiced, I wouldn't be here right now!", "input": "", "output": "You cannot beat yourself up over your decision, Jesse."}, {"instruction": "I know.", "input": "", "output": "Jesse, our time is up. Same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "Sounds good! I guess I'll scoot on over to the bookstore now. See you, Doc!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Jesse."}, {"instruction": "Hi. Um, no. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Jesse, have a seat. What's going on?"}, {"instruction": "Maddie...she's...God. She's pregnant, Doctor Balis!", "input": "", "output": "Maddie is pregnant? When did you find this out?"}, {"instruction": "Yesterday. She'd been really upset since her doctor visit last week. How could I be so stupid? She didn't say anything to me at first. Yesterday afternoon, I heard her talking to Sammy. I know it was wrong to listen in, but I'm glad I did. Christ! I just...I don't know, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Jesse. This was obviously a shock for both of you. When you feel ready, please tell me what happened."}, {"instruction": "A shock? That's a hell of an understatement. I feel like I've been sucker punched. Maddie's so confused, she doesn't know what to do now. Damn! What did she do to deserve this? All we wanted was to be happy, raise a family, retire, and die.", "input": "", "output": "Jesse, have you told Maddie that you know about the pregnancy?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. When I heard her say she was pregnant, at first I was ecstatic. You know, we'd been trying and trying and I thought, \"Great, this will bring us together.\" But then, the thought crossed my mind, \"What if it isn't mine? What if it's that pervert rapist's?\" That was when I felt like I'd been punched. I really lost it. I went down into our basement--we rented a house after the rape--and started beating the hell out of some boxes. Maddie must have heard me, because she came downstairs and asked me what in the world I was doing. That was the most she had said to me all week. I didn't know what to say. I just stood there crying. The crying must have gotten to her, because she came over to me and asked me what was wrong again. So I just flat out asked her why she didn't tell me about the baby.", "input": "", "output": "Here's a tissue, Jesse. I think you should know that the actual percentage of women becoming pregnant due to a rape is very low. Studies show that less than two percent of rape victims become pregnant by their rapist. How did Maddie answer when you confronted her?"}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doc. Well, at first, she just stood there and looked at me. I kept asking her why couldn't she tell me. I was standing there crying like a little baby myself. Finally, she just sat down on a box and started crying. She said she didn't know how to tell me. She wasn't sure what she wanted to do. She wanted to do some research and get her head together. She also told me that very few rapes end in pregnancy. But what if she's one of the rare ones? This bastard has already damn near destroyed my marriage. Now, he's going to take my wife the rest of the way to Hell!", "input": "", "output": "This is going to be hard on both you and Maddie, Jesse. Did Maddie tell you how far along she is?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she's about eleven weeks. Since Maddie told me they do it from the first day of her last period, that means that the pregnancy would have occurred around the time of the rape. She isn't sure what she is going to do, Doctor Balis. What if it's my child, and she aborts it? What if she has it, and it's the rapist's? How exactly are we supposed to decide the fate of this kid and Maddie's sanity?", "input": "", "output": "Those are tough choices, Jesse. However, you can determine the paternity of the baby in utero. You can do some research about it on the Internet. Do you have access to the Net?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, we're connected to the Net. Any info you can give me would be great, thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I'll give you some web addresses which provide information on the two procedures before you leave. But I would like to go ahead and give you some information right now, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, that'll be great. I can share the information with Maddie at home, and we can talk about it. So go ahead. Lay it on me, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Paternity testing can be performed prior to the birth of a child. DNA testing can be done with a Chorionic Villi Sample--CVS for short--which is generally performed around eight to eleven weeks into the pregnancy. The other option is Amniocentesis, which is generally performed twelve to twenty-two weeks into the pregnancy. There are risks to the fetus, such as miscarriage or birth defects. The earlier the procedure is done, the higher is the risk. Most studies show that waiting until the sixteenth week of pregnancy usually reduces the risks greatly. Let me pull up this web address for you. You and Maddie should go over the facts more closely."}, {"instruction": "So they can do it while there's still time to abort? Wow, technology has really come along. Thanks for the info, Doc. It's a relief to know we can find out one way or the other. It makes deciding a hell of a lot easier. This should really help Maddie. Thanks so much, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Of course, Jesse.  No problem. Did you and Maddie actually sit and talk about the pregnancy?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. That's about the only good thing to come of the pregnancy so far. Um, like I said, she sat down there in the basement and just started talking. We were both extremely upset. I finally let her know how I had been feeling. You know, helpless, useless, frustrated, angry, hurt. It almost got ugly when she made a comment about how it wasn't \"about\" me. I kept my cool and told her I didn't feel this way because of me, but because I couldn't do anything to help her. I told her I felt these things because she was the only thing in the world that mattered to me. That bastard had hurt her, and I couldn't do anything to protect her. Then, she kind of looked at me as if she had never seen me before, you know what I mean? Like she had finally opened her eyes and saw I was there. She came over and crawled into my lap, Doc, and I sat there with her in my arms once again, and I stroked her hair for the next two hours.", "input": "", "output": "I'm very glad that Maddie has opened up to you again, Jesse. Often times when people get caught up in their own anguish, they lose sight of everything around them. As you've just said, she looked at you like she hadn't seen you before, and that may be more true than you realize. After something as traumatic as a rape, many have said that they felt as if they were walking around in a daze. I'd guess that Maddie might feel that way. How do you feel about this change in her attitude?"}, {"instruction": "How do I feel? How do you think I feel? I feel like that giant hole in my heart has been at least partially closed. The baby, and the rapist still being on the loose, are the only things keeping me from feeling whole again. It was so wonderful sitting there with her in my arms. We talked and talked. I even told her about you.", "input": "", "output": "How did Maddie react when you told her you were undergoing counseling?"}, {"instruction": "She was kind of stunned at first, really. I think the fact that I actually went out and tried to get some perspective on things really drove home the fact that I cared. I try not to lose control of myself too often, and the fact that I sought you out really made her think. She even suggested coming to a session with me. So the two of you might meet.", "input": "", "output": "I would be more than happy to include Maddie into one of our sessions, if that's what you want, Jesse."}, {"instruction": "Let me think about that one, Doc. I kind of like having you all to myself. Just joking. But I would like to think about it. Let me see how things go over the next week and over Thanksgiving, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Okay. You can let me know later, or give me a call if you decide at the last minute to bring Maddie along to our next session. And I hope you know that you can call me anytime, if you need to."}, {"instruction": "Hey thanks, Doc. I may take you up on that one soon.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that, Jesse?"}, {"instruction": "Oh. I guess I haven't gotten around to mentioning that Maddie's parents are invading for the Turkey Day. They arrive next Tuesday. Lucky for me, Sammy is coming with them. I think Maddie is dreading it almost as much as I am, but they insisted in that way only parents can. Holidays! Got to hate 'em.", "input": "", "output": "In-laws can be very stressful. Do you feel that the situation can remain civil while they're visiting?"}, {"instruction": "Well, hauling off and punching my mother-in-law out is mighty tempting, but I think I'll be able to resist it. To be honest though, they aren't nearly as bad as my parents. Plus, Sammy being there will help out. Maddie's little brother, Max, might come, too. He's seventeen and a really cool kid. His girlfriend wants him to stay home and be with her, though. He called me last week to see if there will be any good concerts while they'll in town. That's how I found out they were coming in the first place. I told him there was always something good going on here. So maybe he'll show up, and we can have some fun.", "input": "", "output": "It's good to hear that you'll have some allies during the visit--that may help distract from the tension. Has Maddie told her parents about the pregnancy yet?"}, {"instruction": "No way! She swore me to secrecy, too--like I'm going to tell them anything. She wants to explore her options before she tells anyone. She told Sammy because she's her best friend. And if anyone can steer her right, it will be Sambo. Maddie's parents are big time Bible thumpers. They'd never support her decision to an abortion, if that's what she decides to do.", "input": "", "output": "They wouldn't support her decision to abort if it turns out to be the rapist's child?"}, {"instruction": "Nope. They would tell her to have it and put it up for adoption. They'll probably try to get one of their Christian friends to adopt it. That would be great. Nothing like a constant reminder around, huh?", "input": "", "output": "I can see why she does not want them to know right now. How do you and Maddie feel about performing an abortion if it's necessary?"}, {"instruction": "Well, there isn't much for me to feel, it's a woman choice. I can't say if it's right or wrong. With the state of the world today--kids running the streets, parents with no control, over population--maybe there should be a few less. But I can't decide for other people. Maddie feels the same way. She would do it in a second if this baby isn't mine. She told me that last night. But otherwise, I don't think she would consider it for herself. But Maddie also believes in freedom of choice--you can't know another human being's situation or feelings.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I hope the genetic testing will help you and Maddie decide what to do. I would urge you to make a decision about the test you want to take soon.  The more you wait, the more..."}, {"instruction": "I know. Thank you, Doctor Balis. You really have been a great help in this whole mess. I've been frantic all day--happy because I have my wife back and mad because of what she now has to decide. I feel like I'm being torn apart. And I can only imagine what Maddie is feeling--it must be a thousand times worse. But I've got to take it one day at a time, right, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Right, Jesse. Work on your relationship with Maddie, but don't over do it. Be there for her, but don't get discouraged if she begins pushing you away again."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know the routine: be there for her, stand by her, help her, understand her. I will do all of this with pleasure now, because now I have hope that things will one day be good again. Do you have that web address for me, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do. Here it is.   This one will tell you about CVS, and it also has links to the Amnio. Try doing some Internet searches on paternity testing in utero and things along that line. I'd also suggest that you and Maddie go see her OB doctor as soon as you can and discuss the in-utero paternity testing. With your circumstances, most doctors would be willing to perform the paternity testing."}, {"instruction": "Thanks again, Doctor Balis. This helps more than you know. Now we have somewhere to start.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "You got it, Doc. See you then.", "input": "", "output": "See you later, Jesse.  Good luck."}, {"instruction": "I always do, Doc. So how are you feeling this week, Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "I'm doing well, Jesse. How are you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm pretty good right now. However, ask me the same question some time tomorrow, and I might answer differently!", "input": "", "output": "Oh, yes. Your in-laws are arriving tomorrow, aren't they?"}, {"instruction": "Yup. In just twenty short hours, my torture for the holiday begins! Actually, I'm looking forward to seeing Max and Sammy. Maddie is a nervous wreck, though.", "input": "", "output": "I see. She is also feeling anxiety over the visit then?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. She's starting to put on a bit of weight, and she's afraid her mom will put two and two together. And, by the way, Maddie told me to thank you for the information you gave us. It was a big help!", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that, Jesse. Have you scheduled an appointment with her OB doctor yet?"}, {"instruction": "We already talked to him. After our last session, I went straight home. I called my boss and told him I couldn't make it in. He's really great about things like that--that's very rare in most businesses. So, I went home and looked at the Web page you gave me. When Maddie came home, I sat her down and talked to her about the paternity testing. She was amazed that they could do it with the baby still in the womb! She hugged me for a long time after she read the pages. It really put her mind at ease knowing she could find out before the baby is born.", "input": "", "output": "I'm very glad, Jesse. This is a difficult decision for anyone to make, and it helps to have as much information as you can get. Now, you said you talked to her doctor?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. She called him the next day. Maddie didn't want to say too much to the nurse about her situation, so she just said it was critical that we talk to him as soon as possible. They told us we could come in Wednesday evening. She hadn't really told him about the rape, so that was a bit of a shock for him. We told him that we had concerns about the baby not being mine. He was so understanding--another great relief. We had printed out the Web pages you gave us and showed them to him. He was, of course, familiar with the procedures. He told us it would be best for Maddie--and possibly the baby--if we waited until her sixteenth week. But he could do the procedure as soon as possible if we want. He also told us about how very few rapes end in pregnancy.", "input": "", "output": "That's very good, and having an understanding doctor will help quite a bit. What have you and Maddie decided? Are you going to do the procedure right away?"}, {"instruction": "Well, since the odds of the baby being the rapist's are small, Maddie doesn't want to chance hurting the baby. However, her sixteenth week is around Christmas. So after talking about it some more with the her doctor, Maddie has decided to wait until the first week of January to have the Amnio done. They did an ultrasound to confirm how far along she was. Maddie got kind of emotional seeing the baby. She's very torn about what to do.", "input": "", "output": "That's understandable. Seeing the fetus makes the situation much more real. For many women, real attachment to the baby begins with an ultrasound. How did you feel about seeing the fetus, Jesse?"}, {"instruction": "It's awe inspiring, that's for sure. To see a little person inside of another...you just can't help feeling excited. It pissed me off though to have that nagging fear in the back of my mind. You know, what if it's not mine? I'm just praying that it is. I'm so afraid that Maddie will pull away again if it's not.", "input": "", "output": "That's a very valid fear, Jesse. Try to stay realistic, but be hopeful, too. Take this time before the Amnio to work on building a solid foundation for you and Maddie. That may help soften the blow if the child is not yours."}, {"instruction": "I'm working on that, believe me. Maddie and I have been getting closer over the last week. We have talked quite a bit about things. Oh, and I'm such a dork! I asked Maddie about her \"meetings\"--when I followed her to that one woman's house, remember? Oh my gosh, I can be so paranoid sometimes! Well, at first she was mad that I had followed her, but then she realized I was just worried. Remember when I made the crack that they \"weren't there for a quilting bee?\" I was wrong! The woman who's house they went to is a seamstress. She had been telling everyone in the support group how relaxing and therapeutic quilting and sewing was! She invited everyone who wanted to try it to come to her house for sewing lessons!", "input": "", "output": "Oh my! Well, hobbies can really help take the mind off of things for awhile. Why didn't the counselor you talked to tell you about this?"}, {"instruction": "Probably because I didn't tell her I'd followed Maddie. I just asked if it was normal for the women to form outside groups. I probably threw her for a loop with my phone call anyway. Maddie was never much interested in sewing or anything like that, but she showed me the quilt she's working on. It's very good. She laughed at me for a long time for overreacting. She didn't say anything about it, because she thought I would think she was silly! I think it's neat, though. I plan to buy her a sewing machine for Christmas to show her how much I do support her.", "input": "", "output": "Wonderful. I'm glad that turned out to be nothing. Do you still feel that her support group was causing her to pull away from you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, a little bit. But that's because Maddie said that there's a lot of man-hating going on. Maddie did say that the one that does the most spouting about men is a lesbian. Not that I have anything against lesbians, but most don't seem to have any use for men anyway. She was the one that got in my face about staying out of things that don't concern me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that Maddie will be able to resist feeling resentment towards you now that you have bridged the gap?"}, {"instruction": "I hope so. We talked a lot about what happened. Most of what she was feeling came from the fact that I couldn't be there for her right away. While I was catching a flight back to San Francisco, she had to be all alone with all those doctors and police. It was traumatic enough without being probed and prodded and questioned. To have to do it on her own...I guess I just didn't think about it that way. When I got back, she was sedated and sleeping. I can be really clueless sometimes!", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you're gaining perceptive on the situation, Jesse. It'll help a lot to keep your marriage on track. You said that things are going very well now. Are they?"}, {"instruction": "For the most part they are. Maddie still kind of jumps when I touch her. She's fine if she initiates the touching--hugs, little kisses, shoulder rubs. But if I come up to her, she kind of freezes for a moment. But I guess that goes back to the trust and power thing. So I blow her a lot of kisses from across the room and make it known that whenever she needs a hug, I'm more than willing.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good attitude, Jesse. It can be frustrating, but just remember not to take it personally. When she initiates the touching, it probably gives her more feeling of control in the situation. However, it does sound as if she's letting her guard down some. That's a good step towards healing. Has she initiated any sexual contact at all?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Almost, but she stopped it. She was sitting on my lap Saturday evening, letting me stroke her hair. Then, she started kissing me, and it began to get a bit intense. We laid on the couch and kissed for a long time. Then, I guess I got caught up and my bad little hands started stroking her breast and moving to other unmentionable areas. She just stopped. She started crying and said she was sorry--she just couldn't do it yet. She took off to the bedroom. I let her be alone for a few minutes, and then I told her that it was okay. I let her know that I was in no hurry and was happy just to hold her in my arms. She said she felt bad getting me all excited and then cutting me off. I told her it was no big deal--I had two hands and could take care of myself. That made her laugh, though I think she still felt guilty.", "input": "", "output": "It's important not to pressure her. However, her feelings of guilt are very normal. She loves you, but she's unable to give you what she thinks you want just yet. It may be best if you let her control the encounters. She will let you know when she's ready."}, {"instruction": "Like I said, I have two hands and am more than willing to give her the space and time she needs! I just wish she would understand that I don't want her to do anything she isn't comfortable with. I get the feeling she thinks I say things like that just to make her feel better. But I really do mean it. As long as I have her back as my friend, and as long as she knows I am her friend, that's all I need right now. I don't need her to show me her love through sex. And honestly, I think sex right now would just get in the way of us working on that foundation you were talking about.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Maddie is excellent at turning conversation, so I wrote her a letter explaining how I felt. A letter is something which she can't change--change the direction of the content, I mean. I have the letter with me, do you want to see it?", "input": "", "output": "If that is what you really want."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doctor Balis. I'd like your feedback. With Maddie's feelings being so sensitive, and with us just now making progress, I would hate to do this just to find out I said something wrong in the letter!", "input": "", "output": "Just wait while I read it. Your letter is written from the heart.  I think Maddie will be able to see that."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "No problem, Jesse. Our time is up for today. Good luck with your relatives and try to have a good Thanksgiving."}, {"instruction": "I will. I feel like I have a lot to be thankful for. And even more, if I don't kill anyone this week. Just joking!", "input": "", "output": "See you next week, Jesse?"}, {"instruction": "Same neurotic time, same neurotic channel, Doc! You have a good turkey day, too. Bye!", "input": "", "output": "###"}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis! It's great to see you again.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Jesse. Good to see you as well. Please have a seat."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doc. Wow, it's been a long time since I've been here.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it has been, Jesse. Let's start with how you've been doing since our last session, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sounds good--a little catch-up. Well, let's see. It was November, just before Thanksgiving, that I was here last. If you remember, Maddie's parents were arriving for a visit, as well as her brother and Sammy, her best friend.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do remember. And I also remember you seemed anxious about the impending visit. How did it go?"}, {"instruction": "Anxious isn't even close to how I was feeling! Well, the visit was going okay at first. Everyone put on a happy face for the holidays. We almost seemed like a normal family. Then Maddie's snooping mother found a notation on her day planner about her next OB visit. Of course, she started probing, gently at first. Then she was really direct.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And how did you and Maddie handle that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we told them. We also told them we didn't know if it was mine or the rapist's. They went nuts! I told you they are very religious, and they do not believe in abortion under any circumstances. They started going on and on about how it didn't matter if the baby was mine or not. Blah, blah, fucking blah. Then, they started demanding Maddie return with them that night to St. Louis. Maddie was hysterical. She really didn't want them to find out until after we had the results, and then only if the baby was mine. And she is mine, I think I told you that already.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you told me during our phone conversation. I'm really very glad that it worked out that way.  Now, please continue."}, {"instruction": "Okay, where was I? Oh, yeah. Well, they wanted her to go home. She almost went, too. I couldn't deal with the chaos, so I took off on my scoot. I figured if she was going to go, there was nothing I could do to stop her. Sammy, thankfully, stepped in. She talked to Maddie for a long time. Then, she talked to Maddie's parents. Then, when I got back, she talked to me. She really was a great help in all of this mess.", "input": "", "output": "It's good that she was there and able to help."}, {"instruction": "So Maddie stayed. Her parents left the next morning. Sammy stayed for a few more days, and that really was great. She sat Maddie and me down and made us talk. We yelled, we fought, we cried, and we broke through. We realized that seeing different doctors, taking different advice, and listening to everyone except each other was where a lot of our problems were coming from.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So, did things start to get better from there?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, they did for quite some time. We got the genetic tests results in early January. That was a major relief. We could finally focus on her pregnancy and our baby and be happy about it. Let me tell you, it's something else--finding out that you're going to be a parent, I mean. Nothing has ever made me so happy in my life.", "input": "", "output": "That is very good news, Jesse. Becoming a parent can bring out the best in many people. How did things go from there?"}, {"instruction": "Let's see, we were up to January. Hmm...well, things went really good through February and the first part of March. We were really happy. We put a lot of the mess of the last year behind us. Maddie was still pretty messed up about the rape, but she was starting to make great progress. Then, on March twenty-first, they caught the rapist. About a week before, he had raped another woman not too far from our house. That freaked Maddie out pretty bad--he killed that woman. Then, they caught him. It turned out he had been the ex-property manager at the complex where Maddie was raped. In fact, he was the man that showed us the apartment when we were first looking there. That really messed Maddie up. You always kind of think of rapists as deranged looking wild men. But this guy was as clean-cut as they come! Or so he appeared to be.", "input": "", "output": "Appearances can be deceiving."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I've been doing some reading about this. Rapists come in many forms. And there are also different types of rapists that rape for different reasons.  From what I could gather about this guy, I think he's in the Sadistic category. I know the rapes had gotten progressively more violent, and the last one ended in murder. This kind of rapist is the most dangerous and the most cunning. The sadistic rapist is usually of a higher intelligence and is hard to catch, usually because his victims die. Maddie is very lucky to be alive.", "input": "", "output": "You have been doing some reading about this. It's a good way to get some measure of control over the situation."}, {"instruction": "Hmm, perhaps. He was a sick bastard. I didn't even tell you half the things he did to Maddie. She is very lucky to be alive, and we both do know that. We have met some of his other victims since he was caught. Some of these women will be forever disfigured--cuts on the face, burns on their bodies...just really sick shit.", "input": "", "output": "I'm very glad they finally caught him. How did you and Maddie react to his capture?"}, {"instruction": "Well, at first, we were elated. The bastard was off the streets. But then, when she found out who it was, it really freaked her out. It just wasn't what she expected. Then the police wanted her help to make sure he was put away. It really put a lot of pressure on her. She started having anxiety attacks and was sick all the time. And she was seven months pregnant at that point. It really took its toll on her. In the first part of April, her doctor put her on total bed rest. She was having a lot of contractions, and the doctor was really afraid that all of this stress would send her into full-on premature labor.", "input": "", "output": "I can imagine the stress was immense for her. Putting her on bed rest was probably the best thing."}, {"instruction": "I agree, though she didn't stay in bed much. We took that time and did up the nursery and spent time together. It was great for us both, I think. She usually worked a lot, and this gave us an opportunity to spend a lot of time together. However, she did start to get really bored and frustrated towards the end. She was pretty uncomfortable--I guess that's normal--and just wanted the baby to be born. Then her due date came and went, and I thought she was going to go nuts!", "input": "", "output": "Well, the final wait for the birth can be very frustrating."}, {"instruction": "You're telling me! But when she finally went into labor, that was another nightmare all in and of itself. Ha! I don't think we were there an hour before she started screaming for an epidural. So much for her thoughts of natural childbirth. And on May fourteenth, at 9:37 p.m., our little baby daughter came screaming into the world, healthy as could be. We named her Natalie Anne. I will bring a picture next time. It's hard to believe she is almost three months old now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad she was a healthy baby. How was the delivery for Maddie?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she felt like she let herself down by opting for the epidural. But I think it was for the best. It was a rather scary and exhilarating experience for me. On one hand, I felt bad for Maddie being in so much pain, but there is nothing in the world like watching your child being born.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How do you feel about the baby now?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Maddie went back to work the week after the Fourth of July. She felt she had been gone long enough. Since I don't have a \"real\" job, I stay home with Natalie while Maddie works. I don't know, though...Maddie seems almost jealous of the baby sometimes. Or maybe she is jealous of me spending so much time with the baby. I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "I see. How is your relationship with Maddie now? Is it strained?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know if I want to call it that. But it has been changing. I think it's just because we are parents now, and things are changing because it's not just the two of us anymore. Plus, the trial for the rapist is coming up soon, around the end of September. And there are deadlines at work and just the general stresses of life. It's an adjustment period, I guess.", "input": "", "output": "There are a lot of adjustments when a couple has a baby. Things do change. You get less sleep and work more. And from what you've told me, it doesn't sound like there are overwhelming problems in your relationship with Maddie with the exception of the trial. So I'm curious, Jesse, why have you decided to come back into therapy?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Doc, there are just so many changes. Maddie seems to be pulling away from me again. Or maybe I'm just reading her wrong and she's just adjusting, like you've said. We had gotten so close, and now it seems to be slipping away again. And I don't quite understand what's going on. I suggested to Maddie that maybe we needed to come back just to get some perspective on life and all the changes we had lately.", "input": "", "output": "And did she agree?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, she actually did. She liked the idea of us both seeing one therapist.", "input": "", "output": "You do both understand the conflict this is going to cause? I can't disclose what either of you say. And the advice I'll give will not always be what is best for the relationship, rather what will be best for you as individuals."}, {"instruction": "Yes, we do understand. We are cool with that. It's not like we need marriage counseling or anything. We just need some perspective on life.", "input": "", "output": "Good, as long as you both understand."}, {"instruction": "Sounds good. Do you mind if we wrap this up a few minutes early? I need to go get Natalie. She is at our neighbor's house, and I don't like to leave her anywhere for too long.", "input": "", "output": "All right. I'll see you next week, Jesse."}, {"instruction": "Let's make it two weeks. Maddie will call and make her own appointments, just like we were seeing separate doctors.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds fine. I'll see you in two weeks. Take care, Jesse."}]
