Please, have a seat."}, {"instruction": "I...uh, I don't have to start talking about my relationship with my mom or anything, do I?", "input": "", "output": "Not unless that's the problem that brings you here. We're here to talk about the issues that are bothering you."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Well, my problem is that I want to kill myself.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Why do you want to kill yourself, Sam?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm just not worth keeping alive. That's why. It's nothing fancy; I just don't deserve to live, that's all.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you think that you don't deserve to live?"}, {"instruction": "Well...jeez, do you want me to go through the whole story?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do. I want to understand what's going on in your life that makes you want to end it. Then, perhaps, I can help."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Oh, hell. Then I'm going to have to go back to my grandparents.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Take your time; we'll go at your pace."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Can I have those tissues for a minute?", "input": "", "output": "Certainly. Here you are."}, {"instruction": "Thanks again. So, where was I?", "input": "", "output": "You were starting to say something about your grandparents."}, {"instruction": "Oh that's right. Man, I'm really spacey lately. Anyway, ever since I last went back to see my grandparents, I feel this sort of downward spiral took over my life. I didn't want to see them again before I graduated. Shoot, I'll graduate in about two weeks. Damn. I can't even keep up a train of thought anymore.", "input": "", "output": "It's all right. Use as many tissues as you need."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doc. Do most of your patients take this long just to get through the first two sentences?", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes."}, {"instruction": "So I'm not some sort of freak for being such a crybaby?", "input": "", "output": "No, and crying is not a bad thing. It can be very biologically productive and is emotionally healthy."}, {"instruction": "It's sort of like flushing the emotional poisons out of my eyes?", "input": "", "output": "Sort of."}, {"instruction": "Okay, thanks. I think I'm ready to go on now.", "input": "", "output": "Please do."}, {"instruction": "Like I was saying, I didn't want to see my grandparents before I graduated. The last time I saw them was at my grandfather's funeral, back at the end of September, in my junior year of high school. My mom took her father's death pretty hard. He used to always call her Dolly. He called every Sunday morning. Anyway, my mom's mom, Granddad's wife...hey, are you taking notes on me? Is anyone else going to see those? Is the insurance company going to have to see them to check if my treatment is legitimate?", "input": "", "output": "No, Sam. Everything that goes on here is confidential except if I feel that there's an imminent danger of you harming yourself or someone else, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Whew. Okay. I'd always heard it worked that way. I just don't want to feel like, \"This call may be monitored to assure optimal customer service,\" you know?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I understand. But you don't have to worry about that, Sam. Now, you were talking about your grandfather's funeral."}, {"instruction": "That's right. Well, we actually had two funerals. Nana--she's my mom's mom--wasn't exactly in the best of mental health by that point. Since we didn't know how she'd react and everything, we held a sort of pre-funeral memorial service for her benefit. This way, she didn't have to deal with being around all those people.", "input": "", "output": "Was your grandmother seriously grieved by her husband's death?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's the thing. She has Alzheimer's. We didn't know if she'd go off on everyone who was there, or if she'd just go catatonic, or if she'd do something else completely. She was already in a nursing home at that point. In fact, about the time she went into the nursing home, Granddad moved into an apartment complex right next to the nursing home just so he could live next to her.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. When you think about it, it was about the only thing he could do. I honestly don't think he could have been separated from her even for a moment. It was such a cheesy old-folks romantic sort of thing, but it was still sweet. We were glad that he died first. With her as far gone as she was by then, she was a lot less attached to him than he was to her. At least, that was what we thought. At any rate, if she died first, he would have died from a broken heart. And that would have been the icing on a hard life.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What was your grandmother's reaction to the service you held for your grandfather?"}, {"instruction": "She cried out loud, just like you'd expect a real person to do. Wow. That was a real cold thing for me to say. I didn't mean it to sound like I didn't think of her as human. It's just hard thinking of someone who barely even recognizes you as a full member of the family. That's all right, Doc; I'm already intimately familiar with where you keep the tissues.", "input": "", "output": "Is this when your suicidal thoughts started?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess. It was always hard to see my grandparents, and her especially. They were all just so old. But it hit me at the funeral: Granddad was gone, and there wasn't going to be anyone left to take care of her.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Oh, we still had some relatives left in that city--like my mom's brother, James--but he wasn't doing that well physically. We couldn't exactly expect him to take care of Grandma like he was a spry, young man.", "input": "", "output": "Where did your grandparents live?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, they were in Kansas.", "input": "", "output": "I see. How did James' inability to take care of your grandmother make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "It made me feel like...well, damn it. It made me feel like I should be that spry, young man who should go over there and take care of her. I felt like I should be able to just quit school and go take care of her, instead. I felt like I could spare a few years of my life to let her live out her last few years a bit better, like a human being. For a few days, I actually contemplated quitting high school and moving way the heck out to Kansas to be with her. I had it all planned out: where I'd finish up high school out there while she just quietly slipped away. You can imagine how well my parents took that.", "input": "", "output": "Did they take it seriously?"}, {"instruction": "No, they didn't. And why should they? It really was a stupid thing to wish, but I couldn't help it at the time, Doc. I was just so torn up over losing my grandfather and then torn up again at having to see Nana without anyone in the family to look after her and keep her connected to the real world. I felt absolutely powerless. And that feeling of powerlessness spread out to feeling powerless over every aspect of my life. When I started feeling like that, I just got a general feeling of helplessness swelling up inside of me. And so I...shoot! Can I have a minute to pull my train of thought back together?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Deep breaths. \"Wax on, wax off. Learn the crane kick, Daniel-san.\" Oh, man. That's got to be the first time I've smiled all day.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to see you do it."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Okay. So anyway, after I got this feeling of helplessness going all through me, I descended pretty quickly into a feeling of hopelessness. If someone's floundering around, feeling like he's got no way out of where he is and how sad he is, I'll bet he gets hopeless pretty quickly, too. By the time the summer between my junior and senior years of high school rolled around, I had gotten to feeling pretty damn worthless. What good is a guy who can't even pull himself out of what's supposed to be a completely natural grief process?", "input": "", "output": "Grief is an extremely powerful thing to overcome. Adults, with plenty of experience with death, often have problems for years after someone close to them dies."}, {"instruction": "All right. I keep thinking that I'm a freak for feeling like this. And that's part of what makes me feel so damn low all the time. I feel like any normal, sane person would be able to easily pick himself off and say, \"Okay, Sport. He's dead, and Nana's in a nursing home. There's nothing you can do. So just get off your pity party and get on with your life.\" But not me. No, I had to keep slipping down farther and farther, letting the guilt eat into me deeper and deeper, until there was basically nothing of myself that I recognized left.", "input": "", "output": "Had you suicidal thoughts like this before your grandfather's death?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it was never as serious as this before. But, yeah, I've had some pretty good trips down into the ultimate pit of self-loathing, as I call it. But I've always felt like there was something that was trying to tug me up before, you know? Like the hand of God or something.", "input": "", "output": "Are you religious?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, there's a laugh. You know, I can probably answer a bunch of trivia questions about which saint did what and how many books of the Bible there are. But as far as being really close to God, I'm even worse than your average, stereotypical, guilt-ridden Catholic. The thing is that I know there have been a lot of times when I could have reached out to a priest or something and said, \"Hey, Father, I've got some serious things going through my mind. Can you help me talk about them to God?\" Well, I could have done something like that, but I felt like I had to be the big man and keep it all bottled up inside of me. I felt like I should be able to deal with it a lot better than I did. Shoot, I should deal better with it now.", "input": "", "output": "That's what we're here for: to help you work through this stuff."}, {"instruction": "Lord knows I need the help. I don't think God and I are exactly on speaking terms right now. So I guess I'm going to have to turn to people for help until he decides to show up in my life again.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I can't help you with the religious part.  It sounds like you miss having that in your life.  Perhaps you might talk to a priest about that.  It might do you some good."}, {"instruction": "Maybe. I'll think about it. It's going to be a long time before I'd feel comfortable opening up to anyone like that about this. I don't want to talk to someone who's in a position to judge me, especially before God.", "input": "", "output": "That's up to you. I think you should try as many options as are available to you to help you out of \"the ultimate pit of self-loathing.\""}, {"instruction": "\"Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.\"", "input": "", "output": "That sounds familiar from somewhere."}, {"instruction": "Star Trek IV. Doctor McCoy quoted it from Hamlet right before they shot into a time warp around the sun.", "input": "", "output": "Interesting. And speaking of time..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. I'm sorry if I made you late for another appointment.", "input": "", "output": "No, we're just fine. Before you go, how do you feel about taking medication?"}, {"instruction": "Damn. I hoped that wouldn't come up. Well, I'd hate myself for having to take it. That's why I've waited so long to start therapy in the first place. It took this absolute crisis point to make me realize that I can't just bottle it up inside myself anymore. Yeah, I'd take the medication, if you think it's necessary. Grudgingly, but I'd take it.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I'm not prescribing anything for you right now. I just wanted to know what your feelings were on the matter so that I could consider your treatment options."}, {"instruction": "Wow, a doc who is actually interested in his patients' opinions on treatment. I'm impressed.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel now, Sam?"}, {"instruction": "A lot better. It helped just being able to get some of this off my chest.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to see you every week, if possible. Does this time work for you?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, for now. We'll have to see about times and stuff after graduation. I have to get a summer job, so we might have to change my schedule to make it work with that.", "input": "", "output": "We can do that. Well, congratulations on finishing high school."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. Until next week then. Same psych-time, same psych-channel!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sam."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Sam."}, {"instruction": "How was your Memorial Day weekend?", "input": "", "output": "It went very well, thank you. How did yours go?"}, {"instruction": "I was hoping you'd ask, actually.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, do you remember how we were talking about my grandparents? Well, of course you do. If nothing else, you have those notes to refresh your memory. Anyway, the whole significance of veterans who had given their lives for their country made me think of all the veterans who died in the past. And that, in turn, led me to thinking about Granddad.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It was weird. I'd tried to just put him out of my mind for the longest time.", "input": "", "output": "Why was that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when he died, I fell into this really deep blue spell. I didn't go as far as...it wasn't as bad as last week, but I still felt this all-pervasive sense of sadness that really started to carry over into the rest of my life. It affected my attitudes about a lot of things. For the most part, it was like all of my feelings were devoted to grieving over him. When it came time to deal with the rest of my life and how I felt about it, I didn't have any capacity left to feel. It was like I was numb inside all the time. Most people would probably have seen something wrong with that.", "input": "", "output": "But you didn't?"}, {"instruction": "Not really, no. I'll admit that it felt a bit weird to not really feel anything. Well, I guess I did feel things, but my feelings were pretty indistinguishable from the sadness I felt over Granddad's death.", "input": "", "output": "Do you remember having any positive thoughts at that time?"}, {"instruction": "No. I'm sure there were plenty of them, but they didn't fit with the overall mood I was in. I've noticed that when I get really sad, I stop remembering the good things and only remember the things that make me sad. Maybe that's why I can spiral down so easily once something really bad happens to me.", "input": "", "output": "It's not uncommon to remember only the bad things during a depression."}, {"instruction": "So you think I'm really depressed?", "input": "", "output": "In our last session, you made it sound as if the suicidal urges continued to arise far after your grandfather's death."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, they did. I went on numb for about three months. Then one day, right before finals, I told myself, \"Okay, grief time is over. You're not going to spend the rest of your life feeling sorry for yourself and missing him, so just get over it. You've got finals to study for, so get to it.\"", "input": "", "output": "And did it work?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. From that moment, I was completely grief free. I know that's not how it's supposed to work. I know that most people can't get over their grief like that. But you have to understand that the feelings most people spread out over years, I concentrated into three months. It was basically the same amount of grief, just experienced all at once. Besides, if I didn't pull myself out of it then, I might have sunk as deeply as I did last week a year sooner.", "input": "", "output": "Did you notice your grief slowly diminishing or did it stop right after you decided to stop grieving?"}, {"instruction": "It was just one day. It didn't look like I was going to feel better anytime soon unless I took some pretty drastic steps. So I took them.", "input": "", "output": "Have you had any grief flashbacks related to your grandfather's death?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. That's why this Memorial Day was so weird. I started having all these memories of him. He was the shortest guy in the whole cavalry, yet they gave him the tallest horse. A lot of the guys in his unit laughed about it, and from what I know of Granddad, he probably laughed, too. He always had a good sense of humor, though he'd always tell the most wretched puns.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But what stuck out most in my mind was how generous he always was. When I was thinking of all the veterans who gave their lives for the country, I thought about Granddad giving his life for his family. All his life, he slaved at the insurance business that he started up to provide for his family, and he went out of his way to be fair to people. He also provided work for family members that were hurting at his business, but that eventually backfired on him.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the details aren't really that important. It boiled down to one of Granddad's nephews stealing his business away from him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was a terrible shock. The whole family couldn't stand the guy who did it. To this day, we don't speak of him. He's one of those types that does absolutely horrible things to you, sends you a card and some flowers, and expects everything to be all right again so that he can take you to the cleaners some other day.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever talked to this nephew?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. He's my mom's age, so I haven't ever really had any personal dealings with him. I know that no one on my mom's side of the family can forgive him for what he did. And why should they? He's shown no signs of true remorse whatsoever. He never gave back the money he gained or anything. He never even said he was sorry to anyone's face. He always hid behind those damned cards.", "input": "", "output": "I can see that you have strong feelings about him."}, {"instruction": "You bet. And I know at least three people who probably would be physically violent to him if they ever came near him. That was one of the reasons he wasn't even invited to the funeral.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. It wasn't just a case of a minor family squabble; that bastard cheated Granddad out of everything he'd worked his whole damn life to build! I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that...well, not like that, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay to express your feelings in here. This is a safe zone where anything short of physical violence can be explored."}, {"instruction": "So I can rant and rave and scream if I need to?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you can. But only do it if that's what you feel you need to do."}, {"instruction": "Okay. No drama shows for your benefit or anything.", "input": "", "output": "Exactly."}, {"instruction": "I can deal with that. Anyway, when Granddad's nephew screwed him over so nicely, it was like he took away Granddad's soul. He couldn't be nearly as generous with us as before--he had a lot less to give. He trusted too much, and that was what killed him. That, and he loved too much. Damn it! Do you have any more tissues?", "input": "", "output": "Here's another box."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Like I was saying, he was just this wonderful guy, and he ended up with practically nothing to show for it. It just shows you how fair life is.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes, it's not fair."}, {"instruction": "It makes you wonder what being good really does you in the end. But then, I remember how people perceive each of them. Granddad died as the family saint and martyr, while his nephew is seen as the Judas who we all wish would go out and hang himself.", "input": "", "output": "So your family still has these intense feelings toward this nephew?"}, {"instruction": "Some do. The ones that were involved in the business with Granddad, like his son, my uncle Jim. He would rip the guy limb from limb if he could. My mom still won't speak of him. But I guess I've given up hating the guy. I wrote a poem about it once. It really helped clarify things for me in my head.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that you've been able to give up the extreme negative feelings."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "You had said that all these memories of your grandfather's death and the circumstances around it triggered feelings within you. Can you talk about that?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. Well, for example, last Sunday when I was in church, I was wearing the watch he'd given me. It was the watch his cavalry unit chipped in and bought for him when it was his time to sign off. It meant a lot to him; I couldn't believe he gave it to me.", "input": "", "output": "Please, go on."}, {"instruction": "Well anyway, as I was sitting in church, I looked down at that watch and realized that I never felt like I was properly dressed up without it. Then I realized who had given it to me--our family's saint and all that--and I took a quick stock of myself and how I compared to him.", "input": "", "output": "What did you conclude?"}, {"instruction": "That compared to him, I'm a failure. He was never so weak as to need professional help with his problems. He could deal by himself. He was strong enough to do that. With all the economic and family advantages I have over him, you'd think I could get through it a lot easier, that I'd have the strength to deal with emotional challenges. You know?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by all the economic and family advantages that you have?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he grew up with just his mom in a time where being a single parent was a terrible thing in society's eyes. And here I am with my two parents. My dad alone can provide everything my family wants and needs. But Granddad had to go to work when he was just a teenager to support his family. He sent support checks to his mom until she died. He had to spend a lot of his energy just to get by. He should have barely coped, yet he did just fine. And here I am, safe and secure, and I can't get over a simple death or someone being put in a nursing home and not remembering me.", "input": "", "output": "By having gone through so much adversity from such a young age, your grandfather had to keep building strength within himself to constantly deal with the situations around him."}, {"instruction": "I guess I had my first taste of adversity at a relatively advanced age compared to him. I haven't had the practice in dealing with bad times like he did. I'm not nearly as used to bad times, and when they hit me, they seem like a much bigger blow. Is that what you mean?", "input": "", "output": "You've led a different life."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess. But I still feel worthless when I try to live up to the standards that he set.", "input": "", "output": "His standards don't apply to you. Right now, you're working on building a foundation of coping skills that will help you cope with life in the future. And you're allowed to develop at a different pace from your grandfather and in a different way than he did."}, {"instruction": "While I guess it's nice to know that; it's still hard not to feel inferior to him.", "input": "", "output": "I understand, and I think we need to work on that. Are you feeling as badly now as you were when you first came to see me?"}, {"instruction": "I'm still really low, but I'm not thinking of killing myself in the near future, if that's what you're asking.", "input": "", "output": "When you think about suicide, do you have a particular plan on how to end your life?"}, {"instruction": "No, I haven't sat down and figured out how to off myself.", "input": "", "output": "Does suicide seem like a real possibility to you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I'm not going to kill myself.  I'm just feeling like it wouldn't be any great loss, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I am trying to assess if you pose a danger to yourself. I'd like you to promise me that you'll give our sessions together a chance to work before you consider something drastic, all right?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.  That's why I'm here.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  I think that you are suffering from clinical depression and we have some drugs that work exceedingly well for people suffering from depression.  Depression is a disease.  It isn't your fault, just like getting the flu isn't your fault.  And it can be effectively treated with a combination of medication and therapy.  So I'd like you to think about taking medication, and we will return to this next time, okay?"}, {"instruction": "All right, Doc. I guess our time is up?", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid so. You mentioned some poetry; if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to take a look at it. I'd also strongly recommend that you keep a journal of what you're feeling. You don't have to show it to me, but I think it will be helpful for you to track your progress."}, {"instruction": "Okay, that sounds fine to me. I'll try to bring you that poem next week.", "input": "", "output": "Very good. I'll see you next week, then."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Until then, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sam."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's official, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "What is?"}, {"instruction": "I'm officially a high school graduate.", "input": "", "output": "Congratulations. For some reason, I thought you already had the ceremony."}, {"instruction": "Well, seniors didn't have classes for the last couple of weeks. It was something about having to get grades computed early so they'd know if we should get a real diploma or a fake at the graduation ceremony. Of course it's not like a U.S. high school diploma really means much worldwide anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Are you planning to go to school overseas?"}, {"instruction": "No. I guess I'm still spouting the propaganda they drummed into our heads when we started the IB program.", "input": "", "output": "IB program?"}, {"instruction": "Jeez, I'm starting to think that no one outside of high school educational system has ever heard of it. IB stands for International Baccalaureate. It's like an Advanced Placement program, except that you're required to take at least four classes in different subject areas a year instead of picking one or two classes in your academic specialties. Some of the courses also last two years. In the end, the exams that you take aren't just scored against performance nationwide. They're sent across the globe to be graded and compared with how students across the world scored.", "input": "", "output": "Interesting. It sounds demanding."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. They say that it's supposed to prepare us better for college. With all the late nights and seeming lack of social life I've had because of it, it better do something fantastic for me. Anyway, even though I've graduated from high school, I'm really waiting to see if I got my IB diploma.", "input": "", "output": "When will you find that out?"}, {"instruction": "They said that we should get the results in the mail by mid-July.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you have a good chance of getting it?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm pretty sure I do. I'd still like the confirmation in the mailbox, though, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I understand. You mentioned late nights and a restricted social life; do you feel this program put you under a great deal of academic stress?"}, {"instruction": "You'd better believe it. There were a couple of times when I just wanted to quit the program and get out from under all that pressure. And I think there was one time that helped contribute to my little snap two weeks ago.", "input": "", "output": "What was that time?"}, {"instruction": "Well, for English class, we were reading Eugene O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh.\" It was depressing as hell. If any of your patients come in reading it, tell them to stop before they get to the end.", "input": "", "output": "What was so bad about the ending?"}, {"instruction": "Well, throughout the whole play, this guy, Parritt, had been saying how useless his life was. At the end of the play, he jumps off the building in which all the action of the play takes place and kills himself. But all the people inside--all of them know he's done it--just keep laughing and partying as if nothing's happened.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "This confirmed what I'd been thinking about all along. If this guy--whom everyone in that building supposedly knew and loved--could kill himself and nobody even cared, why in the world would it matter if I were to kill myself? Maybe I'd be one of the lucky ones and be able to slip off unnoticed, unmourned, and unloved like that.", "input": "", "output": "Sam..."}, {"instruction": "I know, Doc, I know. It probably sounds crazy to anyone on the outside...on the outside of what I'm feeling and why I'm feeling it. Anyway, can I finish the story?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but we'll need to return to the subject of how you're feeling now."}, {"instruction": "All right. Anyway, we had to read this play a couple of times: once to discuss the plot, and then a couple more times to pick up on all the different literary devices. We also had to make a notebook that covered the play in depth and analyzed how O'Neill achieved the effects that he did. But as we analyzed the play, that one scene just kept coming back to me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "After a while, I couldn't even read the rest of the play. I just kept thumbing back to that scene, trying to convince myself that it showed how the world would react if I were to kill myself. Then I thought that jumping off a building brought too much risk of surviving with severe brain damage. I searched through my mind for ways to kill myself which wouldn't have a risk of brain damage. I finally figured out that slitting my wrists would probably work well. And even if it didn't work, I'd have the scars to remind myself that it didn't work.", "input": "", "output": "Do you still have a plan like that?"}, {"instruction": "Doc, it wasn't much of a plan to begin with. It was just a preferred method at that time; there was no elaboration on when or where I'd do it. As you could probably guess, I wasn't doing well on the notebook--I was too fixated on that scene. I figured that I should go in and talk to my teacher about either getting a serious extension on it or having some sort of replacement assignment so I wouldn't have to deal with that play or that scene anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Did that work?"}, {"instruction": "You know, Doc, I just realized that my whole obsession with this one detail of the play was like that guy in \"The Telltale Heart,\" except that I didn't want to kill the play because of the detail. I wanted to kill myself and lie underneath the floorboards, dismembered.", "input": "", "output": "Sam, do you feel that you pose a great threat to yourself right now?"}, {"instruction": "Doc, that was how I was feeling about four months ago. I'm almost done with that, I promise. The play does turn out better than I'm making it sound right now, although now I've probably spoiled the ending for you.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay."}, {"instruction": "To make it short, when she heard what it was doing to me, my English teacher told me that I didn't have to do the notebook at all. I can't tell you how much better I felt after that. She was the first person I was able to tell about how badly I was feeling at the time, and she didn't judge me to be a horrible person worthy of death as I saw myself. The real kicker was that I didn't even have to do a substitute assignment; I think she saw that dealing with having to go to class while that play was being studied was work enough for me.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Now, Sam..."}, {"instruction": "There's a little bit more which will lead right into how I'm feeling right now. I promise. When I was writing the IB exam for English about a month ago, I wanted to prove to myself that I was over that play. So I included an analysis of its structure in the essay. I figured that was innocuous enough to not require me to go into great depth about what happened in that final scene. I think the essay I wrote was pretty good, but it depends on whether the graders see it as a fresh take on an old clich\u00e9 or just more pseudo-intellectual drivel.", "input": "", "output": "How did it feel to write this essay?"}, {"instruction": "Well, given that I snapped about two weeks after writing it, I'll let you be the judge.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think it was the act of writing an essay about O'Niell's play that triggered your depression?"}, {"instruction": "Bingo, Sherlock. I knew that all those degrees on the wall weren't from some mail-order company.", "input": "", "output": "Sam, do you still feel that no one would care if you committed suicide?"}, {"instruction": "To be honest, Doc, yes, I do. I don't see what there is to miss about me. I feel like I'm a person who has messed up his internal life so badly that I'm not even worth keeping alive any more. The only thing that keeps me from doing it right now is that I'm not exactly sure that God completely agrees with me yet.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think God wants you to stay alive?"}, {"instruction": "It's that whole jazz about being created in God's image. If nothing else, God took so much trouble to create my soul that I don't think he wants me to screw it up. But damn it, Doc, it's already screwed up! And no amount of talking about it is going to unscrew it. I've just got to learn that I'm completely fucked up and that there's absolutely nothing I can do to change it. I've got to learn to deal with it and move on.", "input": "", "output": "Sam, you have to understand..."}, {"instruction": "At least I've got to learn to keep other people happy. My own happiness has basically been declared D.O.A.", "input": "", "output": "Sam, do you have any plans to kill yourself right now?"}, {"instruction": "No, Doc. There's nothing concrete. I just have that thought about how knives won't cause brain damage.", "input": "", "output": "Sam, you sound as if you're very close to committing suicide. I need for you to tell me exactly how close you are."}, {"instruction": "I'm not that close, really...well, not as close as I was two weeks ago. I think you're overreacting, Doc. You're just seeing my thoughts unedited, as it were. I edit them a lot myself before I go out and do anything.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that you are likely to follow through on these wishes to end your life?"}, {"instruction": "Not anytime soon, anyway, Doc. I've got my thought editors--what I think God wants for me and what I think is my duty as a member of society--to take away the urgency from my desire to die. But I'm trying to change God's opinion on this and show him that I'm really right on this one--I should be left to die. If only God wasn't so damn stubborn...", "input": "", "output": "Sam, I think that you might be helped by an antidepressant."}, {"instruction": "Great. Give me something to dope me up so my arguments against God lose their coherency.", "input": "", "output": "It's not like that, Sam. Your suffering from depression.  Depression is a disease, like the flu.  What you're feeling right now is a result of that disease.  The medication I'm going to precribe won't dope you up, but it will help you fight this disease. The antidepressant is not a cure in and of itself. It's just a tool to help you get better."}, {"instruction": "Why do I need to get better? I already see myself in a much clearer light than any of you on the outside do.", "input": "", "output": "Your perceptions of yourself right now are highly skewed toward the negative. You've almost exclusively focused on the negative things in life, and you give no credence to the positive. You need to regain a balance and be able to assess yourself accurately."}, {"instruction": "If you say so.", "input": "", "output": "Would you be willing to take an antidepressant?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess. If what I'm feeling is true, a drug that's supposed to clear up my thinking should let me keep thinking the way I do right now, right?", "input": "", "output": "All right. Do you know if anyone in your family has taken an antidepressant before?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm...I think an uncle on my dad's side took Paxil to pretty good effect.", "input": "", "output": "I think that Zoloft would be more appropriate for you than Paxil.  So I'm going to write you a prescription.  Do you think you would try to commit suicide by taking an overdose of drugs?"}, {"instruction": "Good grief, no. It has the same problem as jumping off a building: you risk permanent brain damage.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I'll write you a prescription for a month's supply. It usually takes around four weeks for the drug to take effect, so please give it a chance to work.  You take one pill each morning."}, {"instruction": "Fine. Whatever.", "input": "", "output": "Sam, I'm still very concerned about you. Will you be all right until next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. If nothing else, I'll go out with some friends to take my mind off all this. Really, Doc, you've seen the worst of it today. I'm sorry to have bothered you with it and made you all concerned.", "input": "", "output": "Sam, it's not a bother to me..."}, {"instruction": "I know, Doc. It's just a pleasantry, I guess. Is there somewhere I can go fill this quickly?", "input": "", "output": "There's a pharmacy downstairs. They'll fill this for you right away."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Thanks, Doc. I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Sam.  Please call me any time you feel an urge to..."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "How are you doing, Sam?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, I suppose.", "input": "", "output": "Good. How was your interview?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the interview went pretty well. I'll start working on Monday, though there is a slight problem with that.", "input": "", "output": "What is it?"}, {"instruction": "I have to get my wisdom teeth pulled about two weeks after I start. I swear, I can't remember when things are scheduled for the life of me. There was this whole thing with having to cancel our appointment last week, and now this. I think I'm getting spacier by the day.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think it's a problem if you need to take a day off from your new job to get your teeth done?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. I guess I can reschedule my dentist appointment. But I've sort of steeled myself to have it all done that day, and I don't exactly want to put it off any longer. I can't stand the thought of even such minor surgery. I hate scalpels and needles and all that junk.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "The sight of blood is extremely repulsive to me. Shoot, even thinking about blood makes me a bit nauseous. That's one major reason I'm not even thinking about going to medical school. While the thought of making people better appeals to me, I couldn't begin to imagine myself treating some major traumatic wound with all sorts of blood gushing from it...", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. That's one of the major reasons I don't think I'd ever try anything with knives. I can see it now: I take the kitchen knife, and just as I start to slide it down my forearm, I get completely grossed out and can't even finish attempting to kill myself decently. That's the sort of thing a loser like me deserves, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Sam, are you still feeling as badly as you did during our last session?"}, {"instruction": "No, Doc. I'm just swell. Peachy keen. I have a new job. I'm a fresh high school graduate. I'm going to a great university next semester. Why in the world would I possibly feel bad about myself?", "input": "", "output": "Just a bit of sarcasm?"}, {"instruction": "No shit. Damn, but you're brilliant, Doc. Do you think I'd still be here if I wasn't feeling like an absolutely worthless waste of human flesh?", "input": "", "output": "Sam..."}, {"instruction": "Relax, Doc. Don't get your panties all in a bunch.", "input": "", "output": "Sam..."}, {"instruction": "I just mean that you're getting all worked up over nothing, over a nobody. Besides, I know that deep inside, I don't have the courage necessary to take that final step. I don't even have the ability to do a simple thing like run a knife down my arms a couple of times. What the fuck is wrong with me? I am so pathetic.", "input": "", "output": "Here are the tissues, Sam."}, {"instruction": "Doc, why can't I even get up the nerve to at least try to kill myself?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you really want to end your life, Sam. Your religious beliefs, for one thing, tell you it's the wrong thing to do. And as a human being, you have a very strong sense of survival--a strong desire to live. I think you're here trying to work..."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, yeah. Life goes on, life thrives, life will never give up. It's all propaganda from the biology textbooks, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe that applies to animals with no higher brain functions. But human beings can take an accurate assessment of themselves and can reasonably conclude that they're worthless in comparison to the rest of their species. Well, I don't buy that I have a reason to live.", "input": "", "output": "What is it that makes you feel so worthless, Sam?"}, {"instruction": "My inability to stop the deterioration in my grandparents' lives showed me how worthless I am in general. And this is just one example of an overall trend. It's an experiment that confirms a scientist's theory.", "input": "", "output": "Do you really believe that your assessment is truly accurate?"}, {"instruction": "Of course it is. I wouldn't be so convinced of it, if it weren't completely right.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure about that?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "Sam, I believe that you are magnifying one event in your life and overgeneralizing its importance."}, {"instruction": "Oh, of course I am. You see? You're just backing up exactly what I'm saying. I can't even think straight. I really don't deserve this existence.", "input": "", "output": "Your depression in responsible for distorting your image of yourself. Your depression is masking and distorting your normal thought patterns."}, {"instruction": "Great. So now I've got some sort of mental filter that's...hmm, let's see, I have a filter that is warping my \"proper\" perceptions?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "And you see your job as \"helping me\" by removing that filter and thus taking part of who I am away? Now I know that what they say about shrinks is right. You only care about making people think what you want them to think and not what they truly perceive and think. You're just all mind controllers, not doctors.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not trying to get you to think or act in a certain way..."}, {"instruction": "Bullshit.", "input": "", "output": "Sam, listen to me. All I'm trying to do is point out the reasons you're feeling so bad about yourself and give you some tools to combat your negative thoughts. Whether or not you ultimately choose to implement these tools is up to you. I'm not trying to control your mind. And I will only interfere if you're an immediate danger to yourself or others."}, {"instruction": "That's just wonderful, Doc. So as long as I don't have the courage to act, you're fine with me being a spineless bastard. But if I ever get up the nerve to really go through with suicide and have the audacity to tell you, you'll throw me in the nut house and pump me full of drugs that would take away my courage.", "input": "", "output": "Sam..."}, {"instruction": "No, no, Doc. I see how it is now. You're giving me that Zoloft crap to subtly change the way I think so that I'll be eager to accept your mind controlling suggestions. But if that doesn't work, you'll  toss me where they can give me industrial-strength drugs guaranteed to make me a walking, talking, ever-smiling, ever-bubbly, mindless idiot.", "input": "", "output": "No, Sam. That's not the point of therapy, and you know it."}, {"instruction": "Then I think you'd better tell me exactly what is the fucking point of all of this. So far nothing has changed for me. I've been on your drug for...what is it? Two weeks now? And I don't feel jack shit happening. In fact, I'm more convinced than ever that I'm really meant to die. You said it was supposed to help me feel at least somewhat better. But under your care, I only feel worse. What sort of quack doctor are you, anyway?", "input": "", "output": "You need to remember that the drug you're taking needs time to take effect. We need to build up sufficient doses of serotonin in your brain to make you feel better."}, {"instruction": "Of course. Serotonin--the happy neurotransmitter. So that's how you do it. You make me get all nice and happy artificially in order to make me think that I'm doing better and to make me feel like everything's okay.", "input": "", "output": "The intent is to give your brain normal levels of serotonin and to restore it's normal function. It's similar to insulin injections for diabetics."}, {"instruction": "Uh, marvelous. So I'm born fucked in the head. I'm naturally low on brain chemicals. Shouldn't that be a clue to you, then, that I was born defective?", "input": "", "output": "Would you call a diabetic person defective?"}, {"instruction": "No. But I'm not diabetic.", "input": "", "output": "By your standards, a person born with diabetes is born defective and deserves to die."}, {"instruction": "Well, their problem is physical. It's not a natural facet of their personality, like what I've got. What they take doesn't screw their mind; it just corrects a physical flaw.", "input": "", "output": "In a similar way, Sam, Zoloft isn't acting on your mind. Your problem is physical in just the same way that a diabetic's problem is.  Zoloft is simply restoring the natural balance of chemicals in your brain. Insulin keeps a diabetic from going into a coma so that patients can go on and live their lives as they wish. Zoloft performs a similar function."}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "A person with diabetes can chose to eat fatty foods and to lead a sedentary life even if it's bad for them. But they get to live that life because of insulin. In the same way, after we get your neurochemical levels back to normal, you'll be free to choose to live your life the way you want to."}, {"instruction": "So after the drug kicks in, I don't have to listen to a damn thing you say? And I won't be compelled to listen to you by the drug's action?", "input": "", "output": "Not at all, Sam. Zoloft will just level the playing field for you. When it takes effect, you'll be free to do what you wish to do and not what your depression is forcing you to do."}, {"instruction": "But what if I still want to kill myself? What'll you do then? You said you would throw me in the loony bin...", "input": "", "output": "If you are a risk to yourself or to others, I would have to commit you involuntarily. But in the hospital, the doctors' goal would be the same--to get you better, to get your neurochemistry back to normal."}, {"instruction": "But what if even after they're back to normal and everything, I still want to die and want to take my life?", "input": "", "output": "If you still want to die, then you're not back to normal. You'll be undergoing rehabilitation until you are no longer a danger to yourself."}, {"instruction": "That's like prison. We keep murderers, or attempted murderers, in jail until they are no longer a danger to the society. But how is my suicide socially destructive? I'm just a worthless shit. What the hell does it matter if I lived or died?", "input": "", "output": "Sam, imagine the pain that you would cause your parents and your family by killing yourself. That's one way your desire to die and suicide would be socially destructive."}, {"instruction": "Damn. I guess I understand. So I have to give this Zoloft thing a bit more time before I do anything?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I guess I wait this out.", "input": "", "output": "You can also take steps to make it easier for yourself. It may be a clich\u00e9, but thinking positively and trying to see past the negative mental filter you've developed will help you greatly."}, {"instruction": "All right. I'll try.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Sam. Will you be all right until next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I will. I'll be able to distract myself with work starting Monday, so I won't think about all the depressing stuff as much, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. I'll see you next week at this same time."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sam."}]
