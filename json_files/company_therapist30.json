[{"instruction": "Good morning, Doctor Balis. May I?", "input": "", "output": "Please sit down. I've had patients say that's the most comfortable chair in San Francisco."}, {"instruction": "Not bad.", "input": "", "output": "Although I'd like to hear what happened from you, I want to be completely open with you and tell you what I've already been told.  I got a brief message from Malcolm Spunt about some physical altercation you were involved in, but he didn't go into details.  He did tell me that you were required to come to see me and he requested that I write a report evaluating your fitness to continue to perform in your position as Director of Security.  But aside from that, I have no knowledge of the incident involved and why you were ordered to see me. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Fair enough.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  But before we get into that, can you tell me a little about yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, Doctor, you'll find all that in my SII personnel files. I would very much like to get down to the matter at hand.", "input": "", "output": "All right."}, {"instruction": "Before I'm allowed to go back to work, I must have a written report from you and I must continue this therapy for at least three more sessions.", "input": "", "output": "That's my understanding."}, {"instruction": "Well, I would like to get that report as soon as possible. There were certain projects that I was right in the middle of and that I really hate to leave twisting in the wind. All of them are high priority at Security Operations.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Mr. Spunt...he's a vice president, isn't he?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "He mentioned how central you were to some very important changes in the Security Department. However, you can understand that I need to perform an evaluation of you before I can send any recommendation about your return to work, and that includes getting to know a little bit about you."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, it comforts me that you would be concerned about the quality of your work, but right now, expediency is a priority for me, for the department, and especially for the projects that lay half finished and that are essential to the company.", "input": "", "output": "I understand your impatience to get back to work, Mr. Marcas. If you would like to forego the standard introductory part of the session, I can accommodate that. But at some point, I'm going to have to probe into your personal life so that I can make an effective assessment."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Deal. So what would you like to know first?", "input": "", "output": "Well, you seem eager to talk about the incident at work, why don't we start there. Please describe what happened."}, {"instruction": "You didn't get the incident report? That surprises me.", "input": "", "output": "I probably will get the report at some point. But for now, why don't you tell me what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Well, at an assessment report meeting, I was delivering my recommendations to Mr. Spunt and some other department heads. There was an argument between Ms. Wolfe and me, and it escalated.  At one point, she was standing in front of me. When I turned to pick up a file folder from the table, she grabbed my arm and tried to get me to face her. I waited for her to release my arm and again tried to get the file folder from the table, only to have her grab me and give me a slight push. That was when I assaulted her.", "input": "", "output": "Can you describe the assault?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I can.", "input": "", "output": "Will you?"}, {"instruction": "What relevance does this have towards my evaluation?", "input": "", "output": "I need to completely understand what happened between you and Ms. Wolfe. If you're uncomfortable talking about it now, we can wait until a later date."}, {"instruction": "No, I don't want to do anything that is going to delay your report to Mr. Spunt. I placed my hand on her wrist and twisted her grasp off my arm. With her right arm up and held by my left hand, I punched her in the diaphragm and knocked the wind out of her. As she slumped over a little bit, I grabbed her by the hair and slammed her face into the table. That is the reason Ms. Wolfe is on medical leave awaiting reconstructive surgery.", "input": "", "output": "Was there that much damage to her face?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not certain. I was escorted out of the room, and I haven't been briefed on Ms. Wolfe's condition.", "input": "", "output": "You seem very matter-of-fact about what happened. Do you feel remorse for your actions?"}, {"instruction": "Of course I do. I'm as shocked as everyone else that I overreacted in such an unspeakable way. What I did was inexcusable, and I feel very lucky that I'm still with the company. It baffles me how I could lose my temper like that. I'm only waiting for Mr. Spunt's okay so I may send some communication of apology to Ms. Wolfe.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think you need Mr. Spunt's approval before you apologize?"}, {"instruction": "It's just the appropriate thing to do. I would rather go through all the appropriate channels at this point. If I approach Ms. Wolfe at this time, it may be taken the wrong way either by her or by the department. I would much rather Mr. Spunt and Ms. Wolfe know in advance that I would like to apologize to Ms. Wolfe before I step forward to do so.", "input": "", "output": "I see. You said that you were shocked by your loss of temper. Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Because it hardly ever happens.", "input": "", "output": "You don't get mad?"}, {"instruction": "Of course I get mad, but I never compulsively react to it, and I never react in such an uncontrollable way. Losing control like that isn't good for anyone.", "input": "", "output": "I agree. How do you normally take out your aggression?"}, {"instruction": "Normally, I don't ever really have enough to take out. I can't think of a time recently when I was really and honestly mad.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How about during some of the previous times when you were dealing with Ms. Wolfe?"}, {"instruction": "No. She has never been more than a slight irritation until the other day at the assessment briefing.", "input": "", "output": "How is she an irritation?"}, {"instruction": "She's just herself. She constantly questions me whenever there is a decision involving judgment to be made. She tries to implement policy without my consultation. She has had several conferences with Vice President Spunt to reconfigure the management structure so that I have no say at all on what she does with the department.", "input": "", "output": "And this is only a minor irritation to you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel that Ms. Wolfe feels threatened by your presence and work in the department?"}, {"instruction": "I couldn't comment on that.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not a psychiatrist. I've never sat down and talked with Ms. Wolfe about how she feels towards my work or me.", "input": "", "output": "You wouldn't even offer a speculation on why Ms. Wolfe is acting this way?"}, {"instruction": "I won't speculate on the actions or motivations of any of my co-workers. That should be a job left to the company psychiatrist.", "input": "", "output": "Well, do you think Ms. Wolfe is a bit unsettled by having you--someone from outside and so young--taking a position equivalent to hers immediately upon hiring?"}, {"instruction": "Such is the way of corporate management, though. Because of the workload and the changes that are being planned, the company thought it would be best if two people headed the department.  It could have been a very easy transition with the amount of work for which we are now responsible. I don't see why adding on some new help would be threatening.", "input": "", "output": "So you don't see your addition as being a threat to Ms. Wolfe?"}, {"instruction": "Far from it, Doctor. I'm just here to help her accomplish the changes being planned. It's a job to be done, not a personal contest.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Do you have any aspirations to a higher office?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I have the best job in the world. I work with a sharp staff. We have a budget that more than takes care of the resource allocations that are needed. I have a superior manager that is a progressive thinker and seems personally interested in the progress of the company. You couldn't move me if you tripled my salary and gave me the perks of the president.", "input": "", "output": "I see. It sounds like you really love your job."}, {"instruction": "And that's exactly why I'm anxious to get back to it.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Well, I didn't realize I had kept you so late. I'm very sorry."}, {"instruction": "No problem, Doctor. When shall I come back next?", "input": "", "output": "How about in two weeks?"}, {"instruction": "So far from now? Do you have anything sooner?", "input": "", "output": "Are you that eager to come back?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I would like to get past all of this as soon as possible.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Well, how about a week from today in this time slot--let's see, that's Tuesday, May 26th at 2 pm."}, {"instruction": "That's preferable. Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you then.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Mr. Marcas."}, {"instruction": "Good morning, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Good morning, Mr. Marcas. Would you mind if I called you Logan?"}, {"instruction": "I think Mr. Marcas will be okay.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, you wouldn't prefer me to call you by your first name?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, we're both professionals in our respective fields, and I don't think that my situation will warrant any need to get acquainted on a first name basis. As I said, it's my hope to wrap this whole situation up in a couple of sessions, and then we'll no longer have a need to communicate.", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be very uneasy about having to come here. Do you feel uncomfortable with therapists?"}, {"instruction": "Not at all, Doctor. I'm glad that the company has utilized your services. You seem to have a quite professional practice. However, given the situation I was in and the provocation that caused it, I don't think that my situation is one that really needs the attention of a psychiatrist. It would also raise some eyebrows if it was generally learned that one of the persons most responsible for the various security operations in the company was in therapy. Wouldn't you agree? Oh...and please, when dealing with my little situation, the word \"animosity\" is a rather loaded one.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. However, I can't say that I agree with your perspective. Seeing a therapist shouldn't be seen as reason to question your proficiency in the workplace no matter what your job is. It just means that you are taking active steps to overcome some difficulties."}, {"instruction": "True, but that can be done without the aid of a therapist.", "input": "", "output": "Well, in any case, we do have to continue, if only so that I can deliver the necessary report. Besides, I think you owe me something, Lo...Mr. Marcas."}, {"instruction": "What could that be, Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I sacrificed my normal procedures in order to cut right to the bone at your first session."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes. Hmm, I guess I do owe you a little peek into my personal life. Well, fire away. What would you like to know? I think you have a pretty extensive list of my leisure time activities on file.", "input": "", "output": "Unfortunately, I don't. So let's start. Tell me about your home life. Are you married?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'm single, never married. I just moved to the Bay Area about a month and a half ago. I got the job at SII right away and haven't really had a chance to even unpack, much less go out.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when I was hired on, there were some big changes expected in Security. I threw myself into the work.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "The work I do is infinitely interesting to me, and I've told you of the many advantages to working where I do. We have the resources and the personnel to make some marked improvement in multiple facets of the department. You would be shocked on how primitive the systems were here when I started. We already have two new file security systems running on every file server on the network. We've also instituted some new policies for high security areas of the firm. I've even started some multi-planed firewalls. We've got encryption processes started that will make illegal file access nearly impossible even from the inside, unlike before.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that you like your job so much, Mr. Marcas. So you have no plans currently to seek activities or entertainment outside of work?"}, {"instruction": "As I said, there are still several projects that need to progress a bit more before I'll be satisfied enough with them to lean back a little. Don't worry. I've always wanted to see California. I'll be a regular beach bum pretty soon.", "input": "", "output": "Good. You seem to be a little more casual today--your attire and ease of expression..."}, {"instruction": "Mr. Spunt and I talked the other day, and he agreed to let me telecommute to work for some of the online security measures that I'm in the process of implementing. So I'm doing my work on the SII network from home.", "input": "", "output": "I see. When did you and Vice President Spunt talk?"}, {"instruction": "He came over Saturday morning. I must say that he rather surprised me. I wasn't expecting visitors and came to the door in greasy cut-off sweats and no shirt or shoes.", "input": "", "output": "Is that how you normally dress at home?"}, {"instruction": "Well...I mean, yes. When I'm at home on the weekend, I'm normally dressed down. But it was just a strange situation for me to be seen by a VP in such attire.", "input": "", "output": "I doubt he expected you in suit and tie on a Saturday morning."}, {"instruction": "You're most likely right. Still, it's rather amusing to me now. I was more embarrassed by the state of my loft than I was of my attire. As I said, I'm still not exactly settled--I'm living out of boxes, if you will.", "input": "", "output": "Did Mr. Spunt say anything to you about it?"}, {"instruction": "He was amused that out of all of the things I had set up and established, first were my computers and my stereo. He also mentioned that my flat definitely needed a woman's touch.", "input": "", "output": "Why did he say that?"}, {"instruction": "Most of the decor that I have unpacked is my automotive art and some of my old military stuff.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of military stuff?"}, {"instruction": "I have cargo netting up in a couple of corners. I have some really old nose art from some WWII fighters hung up. I have my badges, insignias, and patches hung up. I have my flag up. It's things like that.", "input": "", "output": "What branch of the military were you in?"}, {"instruction": "Army.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I was in a couple of Airborne units.", "input": "", "output": "Really? May I ask which ones?"}, {"instruction": "I was in the 82nd, and then I transferred to the 101st.", "input": "", "output": "How long did you serve?"}, {"instruction": "I was in for five years. I went in a month after graduating from high school.", "input": "", "output": "I assume that's where much of your initial interest in security matters started?"}, {"instruction": "I would say so. Though the more specialized interest that led me to what I am doing now started about my freshman year in undergraduate work at MIT. That was where I got interested in corporate and computerized security systems.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever see any combat when you were in the military?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "To what extent?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Doctor, the two units I said I was in did some fairly high priority work at times. But just as you have a contract of confidentiality with your patients, my commanding officers and I have a similar contract of confidence. I can't really elaborate on any of the things I did when I was in a combat situation.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever received counseling as part of your military service?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. There were several routine sessions that many of us went through before and after certain missions. If you would like, I can see if I can get you the contacts to have those transcripts sent over to you. Since you are in the medical field, I don't think there should be any problem with you looking at them.", "input": "", "output": "That won't be necessary. Thank you for the offer though, Mr. Marcas. How about your family?"}, {"instruction": "My father lived all his life in Missouri, still does. My mother passed away about three years ago from an aneurysm that kind of surprised us all. I only have one older sister, and she lives in North Carolina where she's a partner in a law firm. My aunt and uncle on my mom's side still live about twenty minutes away from my dad. And I seem to have cousins spread out all over the country.", "input": "", "output": "But no one near by?"}, {"instruction": "No. But I hear Seattle isn't that far of a drive from here.", "input": "", "output": "That would depends on what you call a long drive. Do you have much contact with your family?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. We communicate quite often by e-mail, and a couple times a week, I speak by phone to different members of my family. My cousin from Seattle and I have talked briefly about a possible visit--I'll come to stay for a weekend with her and her family when I get some time off.", "input": "", "output": "Why are you waiting for time off? Why not take a regular weekend and go and visit?"}, {"instruction": "The condition revolving around the job and the incident with Ms. Wolfe has left me unwilling to just up and leave the state. I was also hoping to established an opportunity to telecommute with Vice President Spunt. And as I've said, I'm still trying to get unpacked and settled.", "input": "", "output": "Were there ever any criminal charges brought up? I was never under the impression that you couldn't leave the state."}, {"instruction": "I think the incident report said something about no criminal charges being brought up as long as I went to these counseling sessions.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Last time, you said you were waiting for Mr. Spunt to give you approval to apologize to Ms. Wolfe. Did that ever happen?"}, {"instruction": "Yes it did. Mr. Spunt suggested that I send a card to the hospital wishing a speedy recovery and an apology to Ms. Wolfe.", "input": "", "output": "And did you?"}, {"instruction": "The very same day.", "input": "", "output": "And do you think it will be accepted by Ms. Wolfe?"}, {"instruction": "I hope so. I'd like to offer an apology to her in person as well, as soon as we both get back to work. When I was writing out the card, it seemed to hit me even harder what I had done. I can't believe that I attacked a woman, much less a fellow worker. I really hope that she will accept my apology. I'd just like for things to get back to normal and get back into work.", "input": "", "output": "And away from our sessions?"}, {"instruction": "That as well, Doctor. No offense.", "input": "", "output": "None taken. Are you still uncomfortable with our sessions?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, not uncomfortable. I must compliment you, Doctor. You are incredibly pleasant to talk to, and I have to agree this chair is awfully damn comfortable. But as I've said, I still have some uneasiness about one of the directors of security for a high technology corporation being in therapy. Given the wrong perspective, it might tarnish the reputation of our department and the work we do.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And how do you think the incident--a seemingly calm and collected director of security violently assaulting a co-director at a full staff meeting--comes across? Do you think receiving counseling for such a behavior would be seen as an appropriate action by SII personal?"}, {"instruction": "Touch\u00e9, Doctor. Point well taken.", "input": "", "output": "I don't mean it to sound like I'm intellectually sparring with you, Mr. Marcas. I'm just trying to get you to see that what the company and I are offering you is some help. I don't believe anyone will see your therapy as jeopardizing your position in the department."}, {"instruction": "I see where you're coming from. Thank you for explaining it like that. Well, I can see that we're almost out of time. I do hope that I'm making progress towards receiving a shining recommendation for me to get back in the office.", "input": "", "output": "Some progress, Mr. Marcas. I think that another session would be beneficial."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "How about next Tuesday at this same time?"}, {"instruction": "Is that the first opening you have?", "input": "", "output": "I think it's wise to put a little time between each session, Mr. Marcas."}, {"instruction": "Well, you're the doctor.  I'll see you on Tuesday.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you then."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Mr. Marcas."}, {"instruction": "Good morning, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry you had to miss a session."}, {"instruction": "Me too. But certain projects had to progress despite the lack of doctor's orders. I got called to patch up a little bit of a file access crisis--Vice President Spunt wanted me to come back in.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "It was just a little hiccup in the code. One of the security programs had a little bug in it, and file access and closure grounded down to a halt. Ms. Wolfe was still out on leave, so they called me.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't really know that you worked on code.  I thought you were just responsible for physical security."}, {"instruction": "File security and uncompromised fire walls are an important part of it.  We deal in industrial espionage, rogue employees, the works.  Patrolling the building is just a small part of it in a modern corporation.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't mean to underestimate what you do."}, {"instruction": "We get that all the time.  People get their image of security from the retiree who was hired to play night watchman at their high school.", "input": "", "output": "So you went back to work without the report that was requested of me?"}, {"instruction": "It was just for a few days, Doctor.  But I still require your professional assessment of my sanity and safety before I'm allowed back to my regular status.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Well, I hope that everything is all right now."}, {"instruction": "It is. But you can well imagine the amount of razzing I got about being a \"Killer\" and \"Brawler.\" Some of the guys there really dished it out. But we all get along well, and we got almost everything chased down and patched up.", "input": "", "output": "So you feel you work well with the other people in your department?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I think I do. It seems that all the guys get along with me pretty well. From the program watchdogs all the way to the front desk workers, everyone seems to have accepted me pretty quickly.", "input": "", "output": "All but Ms. Wolfe."}, {"instruction": "Yes. All but her.", "input": "", "output": "So what did you do these last two weekends? Did you make any progress on establishing some social contacts outside of the office?"}, {"instruction": "Sorry, Doctor. I didn't know it was on my list of expectations. You need to actually assign the homework next time. But actually, Doctor, I did get out a little bit this last weekend thanks mostly to the people from the office.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? Can you tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Mr. Spunt walked down with us to one of the Alpha work stations and watched as some of the programmers and I got to work on patching up the access processor. He even took an active part in helping us out. It was about five in the afternoon when we actually got done, and he asked me and about six others to head out to a local pub that he likes. We all bought a couple of rounds, and I shot a couple games of pool with some of the guys. It was a good time. Old Man Spunt can sure knock some back.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Together, he and I probably put away about three pitchers of beer.", "input": "", "output": "I assume you were in a stable enough state to drive home."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. One of the guys had to give a fellow programmer a ride home. I understand he picked up his car the following morning. I never usually drink like that when I'm on my bike.", "input": "", "output": "You ride a bicycle to work?"}, {"instruction": "I have a 1993 Harley Davidson Springer Soft Tail. She is beautiful, Doctor. Do you like motorcycles?", "input": "", "output": "I have a passive interest, but I don't ride."}, {"instruction": "Why not?", "input": "", "output": "Mr. Marcas, we are here to talk about you. Please continue."}, {"instruction": "Oh. Well, I think I'm done. Well, no. I forgot to tell you that Mr. Spunt kind of pulled me aside at the pub that evening.", "input": "", "output": "Really? What for?"}, {"instruction": "He wanted to have a private conversation about the incident. I had told him about my reservations about going to see a therapist, and he showed me some real understanding. However he told me that there was nothing he could do in a situation like this. There are procedures that are mandated by the powers that are higher up and those procedures had been in place a long time.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Later that night, he apologized to me and said that after the way I handled the server situation, he wanted to put me right back into action. But the \"damned legalities,\" as he put it, well...", "input": "", "output": "You must have impressed him."}, {"instruction": "I just did what I was asked. A lot of the credit should be given to the programmers that were helping me out.", "input": "", "output": "It almost sounds like you're being modest. Are you?"}, {"instruction": "No, Doctor. I'm just giving credit where credit is due. It's a team effort up there.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't think Vice President Spunt is one to hand out compliments easily."}, {"instruction": "I wouldn't say that at all. He's been one of the most supportive people that I've worked with. I've heard some of the guys call him a dinosaur and a bastard, but he's been nothing but accommodating to me. Hell, he's almost too nice.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say that?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, nothing really. He kept harassing a waitress at the pub to come over and talk to me.", "input": "", "output": "Was she annoyed by that?"}, {"instruction": "I wouldn't say \"annoyed.\" It was all in good taste, but you could tell that she was quite embarrassed.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "He was making a scene in front of some of her co-workers, and later on, it seemed like they were giving her the same treatment.", "input": "", "output": "How did you react to it?"}, {"instruction": "I tried to just play it off. I asked Mr. Spunt to leave the girl alone and let her do her work.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He persisted, but only a little bit. Her co-workers seemed to give her the royal treatment though. From what little I heard--and I don't think any of it is credible--a couple of waitresses came over to the table and asked some of the programmers about me when I was shooting pool.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever talk to this girl?"}, {"instruction": "Actually...well, yes, I did.", "input": "", "output": "What did you say?"}, {"instruction": "Well, as I was corralling all of the drunken fools into a cattle line going out of the door, she came up behind me and said good night. I turned around and apologized for Mr. Spunt giving her such a hard time. She said that it wasn't a big deal and introduced herself. I introduced myself back. And then out in the parking lot, I turned to hear all of the crew yell in chorus: \"Good night, Mr. Marcas!\" It was quite humorous. But some of the other slurred comments I won't repeat here.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, she and I watched as they all drove off, and she walked with me over to my motorcycle. She and I talked some, and she eventually gave me her phone number.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ask her for it?"}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't. But I wouldn't be at all surprised if Mr. Spunt tipped her an extra twenty dollars to offer it.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps not."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, please. Anyway, we made small talk for about another five more minutes or so. It was mainly about where I work and my motorcycle. And then I went home.", "input": "", "output": "Did you call her?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not really sure. The next day, when I woke up, I remembered that I needed to work my bike and...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Incidentally, that was what I was working on when I got called in back to work. And once I got into my bike, I just forgot about the girl.", "input": "", "output": "You forgot? Did you like her?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I did.", "input": "", "output": "Did you find her attractive?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, hell yeah! She's extremely beautiful--the typical blonde-haired Californian dream. But I think that I'm at least a good five years older than her, though.", "input": "", "output": "Does that bother you?"}, {"instruction": "Come on, Doc. You're starting to sound like my sister, or Mr. Spunt.", "input": "", "output": "Do you tend to follow up in these kinds of situations--where a beautiful woman offers you her phone number?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Doc, I'm not a homosexual. Don't worry. I just got wrapped up in some stuff and forgot. I was working on my motorcycle for a good part of the morning, until after lunch, even.", "input": "", "output": "And did you then work on projects for SII?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you are pouring too much of your effort into your work?"}, {"instruction": "\"Pouring too much effort?\" Doc, I haven't been there in three weeks and neither has Ms. Wolfe. The department has been without a director of operations and development for over three weeks. That's not what would I call putting too much effort into it. I just don't like to leave a gap like that open. If the file access goes down, who is there to fix it?", "input": "", "output": "I see your point. How much longer will it be before Ms. Wolfe is back to work?"}, {"instruction": "I think I heard someone say she'll be coming back this week. She's been in and out of the office. And I think they called her when the access server went down, but she was still at the hospital.", "input": "", "output": "How do you think it will be when you and she are both back in the office, working together again?"}, {"instruction": "I hope it'll be just as you said: we'll be working together. I would like to get on with this and put all of the hostility and animosity behind us. I don't know if that'll be the case, though. I never got a response from the card I sent her at the hospital. I'm hoping that things will go all right when we both get back to work.", "input": "", "output": "I hope so too. It sounds like you've recovered from the situation very well."}, {"instruction": "I wasn't really the one that needed to recover from the situation. That would be Ms. Wolfe.", "input": "", "output": "I meant mentally."}, {"instruction": "I know what you meant, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Last time, you seemed to show strong feelings towards the fact that you had assaulted a woman. I sense that there might still be some unresolved feelings left."}, {"instruction": "Of course there are. That was just the way I was raised. Granted, just as you said, Ms. Wolfe is not a dainty or fragile woman. But it still wasn't right for me to strike her, no matter what she did to me. I think it is agreed that she provoked it, but I never should have reacted the way I did anyway. It's just one of those things that sticks with you. I know that everyone has a temper, but it still makes me feel rather bad that I let mine get out of control that way.", "input": "", "output": "What if Ms. Wolfe escalated the degree of violence?"}, {"instruction": "Even when defending oneself, there are ways to do it where no one gets hurt.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. It appears that we're out of time for today. Is there anything else you wanted to discuss?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so. It has been a pleasure, Doctor Balis. Is there any need for us to schedule another session?", "input": "", "output": "I think so. I think we need a session to wrap things up."}, {"instruction": "Very well. Can we do it as soon as possible?", "input": "", "output": "How about next Tuesday at  two in the afternoon?"}, {"instruction": "All right. I must say that I'm really going to miss...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "This chair.", "input": "", "output": "Good day, Mr. Marcas."}, {"instruction": "Morning, Doc. I'm sorry about missing my last appointment, but...well, something came up.", "input": "", "output": "Good morning, Mr. Marcas. Next time, please let me know if you are unable to attend your session."}, {"instruction": "I'm hoping there won't be a next time, Doctor.  This is my last session.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. You seem to be in a formal attire again today. Are there still problems with the network?"}, {"instruction": "Nope. I'm just going to a little informal meeting with Vice President Spunt this afternoon.", "input": "", "output": "For an informal meeting, you seem quite formally dressed."}, {"instruction": "Well, Doc, in an environment like SII, I'm expected to dress a certain way. It's part of the whole corporate management image. When Mr. Spunt says \"informal,\" he means that it will be short and most likely private.", "input": "", "output": "Does Vice President Spunt often have private meetings with his department heads?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, yes. He does. Most of the time, it's just pulling us aside. Sometimes, if it's more serious, he'll ask us into his office.  But that's kind of rare.", "input": "", "output": "And do you think this will be in his office?"}, {"instruction": "Most likely.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, like I said, this situation is rather rare. It's not often that there is a physical assault in a full staff meeting, especially with a new manager that has only been on the staff for two months.", "input": "", "output": "Do you perceive your newness in the office as the reason for a private meeting?"}, {"instruction": "No. I think it's the situation at hand.", "input": "", "output": "What situation is that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, if you could look at the strategic plan that was set out for the Security Department by higher management, a lot of pressure has been put on Vice President Spunt. His two operations directors have been out for a considerable time now--what is it, six weeks? He wants us both back in the saddle as soon as possible. I think that's what he wants to talk to me about. I would assume that Ms. Wolfe has been keeping in contact with Mr. Spunt just as I have.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mean Ms. Wolfe has been having private meetings and off hours visits with Vice President Spunt?"}, {"instruction": "I assume.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, why wouldn't I? I doubt that Mr. Spunt would give me preferential treatment over Ms. Wolfe, especially since they have worked together longer.", "input": "", "output": "How much longer?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure, probably a few years.", "input": "", "output": "How do you know that?"}, {"instruction": "During my second interview, I asked how long the other director had been working here, what his or her experience was, what his or her expertise were, and where his or her degree was from. I did a pretty good check on the department, before I agreed to take the job.", "input": "", "output": "I guess your security background drove you to carefully inspect your potential surroundings."}, {"instruction": "No, Doctor, it wasn't that. It was just basic job hunting skills. Doctor, is everything all right? I feel like I'm under the microscope again.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable, Mr. Marcas."}, {"instruction": "No problem. But you seem to be a bit fatigued today.", "input": "", "output": "I'm fine. Thank you for asking, though."}, {"instruction": "Is the company stacking a lot of work on you? I heard that people are kind of therapy crazy out here.", "input": "", "output": "Mr. Marcas, please let's return to the subject at hand.  I don't think we'll make much progress if we sit here and talk about me."}, {"instruction": "I was just commenting on your slight appearance of fatigue. I'm sorry if I've made you feel uncomfortable. Please continue, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Anything on the social front?"}, {"instruction": "I finally called Miss California Dream waitress.", "input": "", "output": "Good. And how was that?"}, {"instruction": "She's a really nice girl. Energetic, vivacious, bubbly of course.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "She asked all kinds of questions about my work. I don't think she understood half of what I told her. She is very beautiful, but I don't think she has a grasp on anything that has to do with technology.", "input": "", "output": "Well, don't hold that against her. I bet I could confound you, too, if I started to spout psychoanalytic jargon."}, {"instruction": "Yes, that's true. Part of my job--this was missing from the written job description--is explaining technology. But, I'll say one thing for her--she does seem to have an eagerness to learn.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. She invited me over to her apartment to help her set up her computer. She is having some trouble with it.", "input": "", "output": "When are you going?"}, {"instruction": "We haven't set a date yet. I'm still rather pressed for time.", "input": "", "output": "Why? Have you been going into the office?"}, {"instruction": "No, I've just been logging long hours in front of the terminal at home. There has been a big push to get some of the final modules implemented in the second level platform. I've been pulling some major hours. But I'm not suffering from sleep deprivation or social ostracization, though.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's not a big deal.  I'm worried that you might be blowing the whole work situation out of proportion. I don't want you to think that my eagerness to return to work makes me a workaholic or suggests that I need to be constantly monitored.  With SII's penchant for therapy, I'll probably be back in therapy just because I want to work a couple of hours of over time.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  It's unusual for someone to work overtime at SII.  That seems to be part of the corporate culture, too.  But why do you think that SII has a particular penchant for therapy?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Lisa and I got into a discussion about the whole network of therapist and psychiatrists in California.", "input": "", "output": "Lisa is the waitress that you met?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. We got around to talking about how I'm in therapy, and she wasn't the least bit shocked about it.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "Go ahead and say it--you told me so. She said that seeing a therapist is a common thing, especially for corporate management. She said that some of the guys she dated were not even as high-up in management and still they were asked to see a therapist just for job-related stress.", "input": "", "output": "Job stress is fairly common, and not just in the high-tech industry."}, {"instruction": "I know, Doc, I know. Therapists aren't just for lunatics. I overreacted. My fault. I'm rather glad that I got this chance.", "input": "", "output": "Really? Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it really taught me something. Now, I'm not the least bit afraid to come and see a therapist if I have to. I no longer believe that people will think I'm crazy if they find out I was seeing a therapist. I can just go and unload on somebody, and it will not be seen as breaking down or going crazy.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you really have made progress on that front."}, {"instruction": "I'd like to think so.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm ready to write my report. Now that we spent some time together, I hope you'll be able to recognize your potential for exploding in a confrontational situation. And I hope you'll be able to take steps to vent the pressure before it gets to that point again."}, {"instruction": "I've been thinking about that. It seems that the cold, unspoken tension between Ms. Wolfe and me is the majority of our problem. If we had communicated more openly, I wouldn't have snapped like I did. I'll be making an effort to communicate with Ms. Wolfe on regular basis, even if only by e-mail or memo.", "input": "", "output": "I think that would be a very good idea."}, {"instruction": "So this is our last session?", "input": "", "output": "It is, unless SII wants further treatment, or if you do, of course.  You are welcome to come back anytime that you think I could be of help to you."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Well, I doubt that will be the case. It has been a pleasure, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you.  Tell me more about Lisa."}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "We still have a few minutes."}, {"instruction": "Well, we've only been out once. It's too early to speculate just yet, but I'm pleased so far.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I hope you will continue to expand your social sphere outside of work.  Working at SII can be quite socially claustrophobic."}, {"instruction": "I will. Lisa has some friends she wants to introduce me to.", "input": "", "output": "Good. You have all the signs of a classic workaholic, and I don't think it would be healthy for you to isolate yourself through your work."}, {"instruction": "I hear you--take it easy on the workload.", "input": "", "output": "That's right. Try to keep up with your leisure time activities."}, {"instruction": "The stereo and my horse have kept me busy so far. I have to get them both sounding just right.", "input": "", "output": "Your horse?"}, {"instruction": "My Harley Davidson, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Ah, of course."}, {"instruction": "Doc, I'll do my best. Thank you for your help and your suggestions. If there are other things that come up that are serious enough to warrant the attention of the upper management, I'm sure that they won't hesitate to call you or send you the ever-present memo.", "input": "", "output": "I hope that you have enough self-knowledge to notice if something is serious enough to warrant therapy before your employers do."}, {"instruction": "Hey, Doc, after this...if I notice anything, it will be my name on the therapy request form. Thank you for your help.", "input": "", "output": "Is there anything else you'd like to add?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think...wait. Here, Doctor. Good catch.", "input": "", "output": "What's this for?"}, {"instruction": "I figure that with all the notes you've been taking during our sessions, I owe you a pen.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Mr. Marcas."}, {"instruction": "Ah, hell. Call me Logan. I may not be in here again. And, Doctor?  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "You're most welcome, Logan. Take care."}]
