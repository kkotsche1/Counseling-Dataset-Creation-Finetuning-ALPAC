[{"instruction": "Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Sarah.", "input": "", "output": "Have a seat, Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I'm a little nervous, would you mind if I took off my\nshoes? I always take off my shoes when I'm nervous.", "input": "", "output": "If that makes you comfortable go ahead. So, why did you came\nto see me today?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's kind of hard to explain. I went to my family doctor\nfirst and he suggested I see you.", "input": "", "output": "What sort of symptoms are you having?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I feel like I'm going to explode at any minute. Like I\ncould jump out of my skin. I cry a lot. A lot! My stomach hurts all the\ntime and I can't sleep more than an hour or two straight. And when I do\nsleep, I have the same dream over and over again. I keep dreaming of falling\ndown a flight of steps. It's scary. Oh and I get words mangled up in my\nmind. I'll mean one thing, but say something else.", "input": "", "output": "Can you give me an example of how you get words mangled up?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. Like the first time it happened, I was talking to my girlfriend\non the phone. Her name is Lisa. She and I have been friends for years. Actually,\nshe should be the one sitting here, if you know what I mean. Talk about\nproblems! Anyway, I told her I was going to run over to KMart and get some\ngarlic.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What did you mean to say?"}, {"instruction": "I meant to say I was going to get\nsome new sheets for our bed. Well, right away Lisa just starts laughing,\nand I say, \"What the hell are you laughing at?\" And she says,\n\"Why are you going to KMart to get garlic. I have garlic if you want\nto borrow some.\" Well, that really scared me, you know? I told her\nsomeone was at the door and I had to hang up. I stayed in bed the rest of\nthe day and cried. When my husband Jeff got home from work that day, that's\nthe way he found me. Crying. Only I couldn't tell him what I was crying\nabout.", "input": "", "output": "Why couldn't you tell him why you were crying?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I guess I just didn't want to burden him with\nany more problems. He'd been so supportive since my heart attack, I just\ndidn't want to push him any further. Ever since I came home from the hospital,\nI just can't seem to get my shit together.", "input": "", "output": "You had a heart attack? When was this?"}, {"instruction": "About 3 months ago. It was mild, but I had to have that heart\ncatheterization done. No big deal. The only thing is, I keep having the\nsame kind of pain I had that day, so I go to the emergency room thinking\nI'm having another heart attack. The first couple of times the doctors were\nvery sympathetic. You know, they'd check out my heart, say everything was\nfine, give me something to calm my nerves, then send me home.", "input": "", "output": "Please go on."}, {"instruction": "Well, my husband and my girlfriend--the one I was telling you\nabout?--they talked me into going to see my family doctor. He looked over\neverything in my records, sent me for more friggin' tests, and finally decided\nall my pains and complaints are...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, he thinks it's all in my head. He doesn't think there's\nanything wrong with me physically. I just think he doesn't want to try to\nfind anything else. It's easier to just send me to a head shrinker! Sorry,\nI don't mean to offend you.", "input": "", "output": "No offense taken. Tell me, what do they think caused the heart\nattack? Do you have a family history of heart problems?"}, {"instruction": "Nope, no family history of anything! I guess they think stress\nhad a lot to do with it.", "input": "", "output": "Are you under a lot of stress, Sarah?"}, {"instruction": "No more than anyone else, I guess. I got a husband, three kids,\na house, a part time job.....you know, the regular stuff that goes along\nwith that.", "input": "", "output": "You seem awfully young to have had a heart attack."}, {"instruction": "Look, Doc. I've heard this story a hundred times and I'm sick\nof it! Yes, I'm too young to have had a heart attack, but I did!", "input": "", "output": "Why are you so angry?"}, {"instruction": "Why shouldn't I be! I'm feeling a lot of things. Anger, frustration,\nfear.", "input": "", "output": "I can empathize with what you must be going through."}, {"instruction": "Oh I seriously doubt that! Did you have a heart attack at 33\nyears old? Did your life suddenly change over night? Did you have to face\nyour husband, your kids, your family, and say, Look, I've fucked up, I'm\nsorry. My god, the guilt I've been living with, putting everyone through\nthis bullshit. I just keep saying I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can't even look\nat anyone without crying. No, I doubt you can understand.", "input": "", "output": "It's true that I've never had a heart attack, but I have worked\nwith other patients who have."}, {"instruction": "Okay, so maybe you can try to understand, but it's hard for\nme to even understand. I can't begin to understand why this has happened.\nI know that bad things happen to good people. I truly believe that the things\nthat happen in your life, happen for a reason. You may not know what the\nreason is right away, but still, there's a reason. Maybe my heart attack\nwas for someone else's benefit.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure what you mean."}, {"instruction": "Okay, when I was in the emergency room, there was a high school\ngirl there for career day. They asked me if it was okay if she stayed in\nthe room, and I said sure. Her name was Abby and we talked a lot, but when\nshe found out I was having a heart attack, she nearly freaked out. She had\nto leave the room. I'm like, \"Hey girl, I'm the one with the chest\npain. Why are YOU leaving?\"", "input": "", "output": "I still don't understand. What could that girl have to do with\nyour heart attack?"}, {"instruction": "See, this is the funny part. I found out later that she had\nthought she wanted to be a doctor but, when she freaked out, she realized\nthe medical profession was not her thing, you know? So, if I hadn't come\ninto the emergency room that very day Abby was there, she might have spent\nyears in med school to find out she wasn't cut out for it. If you think\nabout it, I saved that girl and her family a hell of a lot of money!", "input": "", "output": "That's quite a stretch, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not saying I believe that's why I had the heart attack,\nI'm just saying it could be something like that. I was suppose to see my\nmother-in-law the day I had the heart attack. What better way to get out\nthat situation?", "input": "", "output": "You don't get along well with your mother-in-law?"}, {"instruction": "Oh please, let's not waste time talking about her. She's the\nleast of my problems.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have other problems that you'd like to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think people should dwell on their problems, you know?\nRight now my biggest problem seems to be why they can't find any good reason\nwhy I keep having chest pains. I'm sure if I could just get this all straightened\nout, I'd feel a lot better. It's just so frustrating!", "input": "", "output": "Did you have any history of heart problems before the heart attack?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Did the doctors say that your heart was badly damaged as a result\nof the attack?"}, {"instruction": "No, they told me I was fortunate in getting to the hospital\nquickly. And they told me that the heart wasn't badly damaged.", "input": "", "output": "I presume they put you on nitroglycerin or amyl nitrite?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, nitroglycerin pills. I carry them in my purse.", "input": "", "output": "You said you have a part time job?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I work part time as an office manager for a dental office.\nActually, I was working for two dental offices at the time of the attack,\nbut I've given one up.", "input": "", "output": "And your husband? What does he do?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, he's a computer nerd. His title is Systems Process Control\nEngineer, which basically means that he's boring at cocktail parties.", "input": "", "output": "I see also that your doctor has you on Ativan. I guess you're\ntaking that for anxiety? How is that working for you?"}, {"instruction": "Not very well, I don't think. I take it because they give it\nto me, but I really don't notice any less anxiety. I still cry all the time.\nJust the smallest things upset me. What really bothers me is that I'm scared\nof what this is all doing to my husband and kids. Everyone walks around\non egg shells. My husband never knows what kind of mood I'll be in, and\nmy kids are afraid to come home from school to find me sitting on the kitchen\nfloor crying. Honestly, I'm afraid the men in the white jackets will come\nand carry me away. I feel like I've lost control of my life and I can't\nseem to get it back.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you're not just talking about losing control after\nyour heart attack."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's true. For a long time I'd just been going along\nwith life, like floating down a stream. But then one day it was like I just\nwoke up and said, \"This is bullshit.\" Since then, I started taking\na more active role in the decision making in my life.", "input": "", "output": "Who had been making the decision before that time?"}, {"instruction": "Everyone else in my life. My husband, my parents, my boss--especially\nmy husband and my boss.", "input": "", "output": "Why did your boss have so much control over your life?"}, {"instruction": "Oh jeez, I was hoping we wouldn't have to get into all that\nright now.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine, we can talk about something else."}, {"instruction": "Good, cause I'm just not ready to deal with that yet.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay. I'll be talking to your doctor, but since the Ativan\nhasn't been working for you, I would recommend switching you to another\ndrug called Xanax. I've had some good results with it for panic disorders,\nwhich might help with your chest pain. I'll write you a prescription for\nthe generic alprazolam. Let's see how that works for you."}, {"instruction": "That's fine. At this point I'm willing to try anything.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Why don't we make an another appointment for next week?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, sounds good to me. Can I ask you something before I go?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, what is it?"}, {"instruction": "Do you think I'm loony?", "input": "", "output": "No, Sarah, I don't think you're loony."}, {"instruction": "Good, that makes me feel better already.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad. I'll see you next week then."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. Would it be all right if I took my shoes off again?", "input": "", "output": "Certainly, if that makes you comfortable. How are you feeling?"}, {"instruction": "Better than I was last week. Sorry I had to cancel our appointment, but I had a nasty sinus infection and felt pretty bad.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, I'm glad you're feeling better. Last time you were here, we switched you from Ativan to Xanax. How does that seem to be working?"}, {"instruction": "Right now it's hard to say. Since I've been sick I haven't noticed a lot of anything. I guess no news is good news.", "input": "", "output": "In that case let's keep you on the Xanax and see how it goes. During your last visit we talked about your heart attack and your fear of having another one."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well can we talk about something else for awhile? I'm really sick of discussing my heart attack. It gets old after awhile.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Let's talk about the stress that led to the heart attack."}, {"instruction": "Stress. I hate that word. Everyone is always asking, \"Are you under a lot of stress?\" Gee, isn't everybody?", "input": "", "output": "Yes Sarah, I believe everyone lives with some sort of stress, but it's a matter of how you deal with stress that's important."}, {"instruction": "I understand that, but I've been dealing with stress all my life, right or wrong, it's the only way I know.", "input": "", "output": "Which way is that?  How do you deal with stress?"}, {"instruction": "It usually depends on what the situation is, but mostly I ignore whatever it is that's bothering me. Or at least I try to. I realize this isn't the best solution, but it's all I know.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about some things that were stressful at the time of your heart attack."}, {"instruction": "Well, I was working at one dental office full time, and another office part time. It got to be real confusing. When the phone would ring, I'd have to stop and think about which office I was at before I'd pick up the phone. Sometimes I made the mistake of saying the wrong doctor's name.", "input": "", "output": "Did this cause trouble for you with the doctors?"}, {"instruction": "No not really. Actually they were both pretty good about the whole thing. Well I take that back. Doctor Teynor, he's the one I worked full time for, he was kind of a jerk. Not just about answering the phones wrong, but about...well everything really.", "input": "", "output": "If you didn't like working for him, why didn't you quit? Was it a financial decision?"}, {"instruction": "No not really. I mean the money was nice, but it was just my own pocket money. Jeff brings home a good salary, more than most of our friends do anyway.", "input": "", "output": "So why didn't you just quit?"}, {"instruction": "I did eventually, about a month before my heart attack.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you wait so long?"}, {"instruction": "Well it's a long story.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to hear it."}, {"instruction": "I was afraid you'd say that. Okay, here's the deal. I knew Robby, I mean Doctor Teynor, before he was a doctor. Actually we dated for a few years in high school. He was two classes ahead of me, but he didn't decide to go to dental school until right before I graduated. I think he was afraid I'd want to get married and him going off to college would put an end to that.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And did you want to marry Robby?"}, {"instruction": "Yes I suppose so. I mean I just assumed we would get married. He was working at a decent job, going to school part time to be an accountant. I figured it was just a matter of time before we set the date.", "input": "", "output": "So tell me what happened when he left for college."}, {"instruction": "Here's where it gets sticky. When Robby left for college, I was pregnant only I didn't know I was pregnant, so he didn't know either.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "My first reaction was to call Robby and tell him. I figured he'd come home, we'd get married and live happily ever after.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what happened?"}, {"instruction": "No, not exactly. I decided to surprise Robby. I drove all the way to where he was going to school. When I got to his apartment, his roommate answered the door. I asked if Robby was home and he said, \"Sure, come on in.\" Well it was kind of early and Robby was still in bed, so this other guy went to wake him up. They were in the bedroom for quite awhile before Robby came out and I overheard them arguing, though I'm still not quite sure what they were arguing about. Anyway Robby was definitely surprised to see me. He gave me a hug and a kiss on the forehead and said all the right things, but I knew in my heart something had changed.", "input": "", "output": "What did you feel had changed."}, {"instruction": "I wasn't sure at the time. Things just seemed funny. He'd only been gone about 3 weeks, hadn't even actually started school yet at that point. Anyway Robby and his roommate, I think he said his name was Ben, they seemed very close if you know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "Please explain."}, {"instruction": "It was very obvious that Ben was gay and that he was upset by my presence there. Apparently Robby had told him about our relationship and he saw me as a threat. At first it didn't sink in what I was seeing; I just kind of ignored Ben and tried to talk to Robby in private. But Ben just wouldn't leave us alone. Finally I just asked Robby if we could go somewhere and talk and he told me that this was not a good time, that he and Ben had made plans and he didn't want to disappoint him. By the time I left their apartment, I was sure my relationship with Robby was over.", "input": "", "output": "Had you told Robby you were pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Did Robby tell you he was gay?"}, {"instruction": "No, but I knew it in my heart. Then years later, of course, he confirmed my suspicions.", "input": "", "output": "So what did you do after you left Robby's apartment?"}, {"instruction": "First panic set in. I was totally freaking out. I was 18 years old, pregnant, and pretty sure the father of my baby was gay. The future didn't look very bright. I called Robby's best friend and told him what had happened with Robby, and that I was pregnant.", "input": "", "output": "How did he react?"}, {"instruction": "Not very well. He was absolutely disgusted by the very thought of Robby being gay. He ranted and raved for hours. When he finally calmed down, he asked me what I was going to do about the baby. I told him that I felt the best solution was to have an abortion.", "input": "", "output": "Did he agree?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he said the choice was mine and he would help any way he could. Actually he gave me the money for the surgery. So I made an appointment and went to the clinic, but then I couldn't go through with it. I decided to keep the baby. Robby's friend was really supportive. He knew why I didn't want to tell Robby about the baby so, in the end, he asked me to marry him and I accepted.", "input": "", "output": "Your husband was Robby's best friend?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, Jeff, that's right.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So you married your gay ex-boyfriend's best friend?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. It does seem kind of odd, doesn't it? We got married in August of 1981 and Melissa was born in March of '82. Of course we caught hell from both our families, especially Jeff's mother. No one else seemed to think much of it. You know, woman's heart is broken, she runs off and marries his best friend. A classic case of love on the rebound.", "input": "", "output": "And you and Jeff are raising the child you conceived with Robby?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I'm sure that now people realize what happened, especially when Melissa was born just 7 months after the wedding. And, to be honest, Melissa does look quite a bit like Robby.", "input": "", "output": "How does Jeff feel about this?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, he's been great about it. He doesn't treat Melissa any different than our other two.", "input": "", "output": "Does Melissa know that Jeff is not her real father?"}, {"instruction": "No, we've decided not to tell her, at least not yet. Maybe someday.", "input": "", "output": "What about Robby; does he know he fathered a child?"}, {"instruction": "Yes I told him, but it was several years later.", "input": "", "output": "How did that come about?"}, {"instruction": "Well, after we first started working together, before he told me he was gay, we were getting along really well. Thoughts of him being gay seemed silly at that time. I think I was beginning to fall in love with him again, so in order to seal our relationship, I told him about Melissa.", "input": "", "output": "And how did he react?"}, {"instruction": "At first he acted surprised, but then later he told me he had suspected it all along. When I came out and asked him if he and I could ever have another relationship, that's when he told me he was gay.", "input": "", "output": "How did you respond?"}, {"instruction": "I thought he was joking! In the back of my mind, I had the scene from his apartment from years earlier, but nothing was connecting. I guess I was in denial over it. I told him that if he didn't want a relationship with me, that he didn't have to make up such horrible lies.", "input": "", "output": "Eventually you came to terms with his homosexuality?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but it was years before that happened.", "input": "", "output": "But you and Jeff went on to have two more children of your own, is that correct?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Three years after Melissa, we had J.J., Jeff Junior, and then two years later we had Nicolas.", "input": "", "output": "So you and Jeff have been married since 1981?"}, {"instruction": "We just had our 15th anniversary last month.", "input": "", "output": "It would appear that you two have a stable relationship."}, {"instruction": "Well we did, until Robby moved back to town. That seems to be when all the big problems started.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps we should save that for next week. Our time is up for today. Let's make an appointment for next week."}, {"instruction": "Sure. Monday's are better for me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay well let's keep it at this same time.  Monday September 30th at 2 pm?"}, {"instruction": "All right, I'll see you then.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. I hope you won't mind if I take off my shoes...", "input": "", "output": "No, I don't mind. Make yourself comfortable. How have you been feeling this week?"}, {"instruction": "Not too bad I guess. I did have several crying spells though.", "input": "", "output": "What made you cry?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing. Everything. It's hard to tell the difference anymore. I'm really scared that I'm losing my mind! I'll be fine one minute and the next I'm laying on the floor curled up, crying like a baby. I have no warning, no time to prepare.", "input": "", "output": "What's going through your mind when you have these crying spells?"}, {"instruction": "Pain.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mean physical pain?"}, {"instruction": "No not like that. It's deep, a place that's hard to reach. It's difficult to explain. It's more like a pain...in my soul.", "input": "", "output": "I see. How long do these spells usually last?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes a few minutes, sometimes a few hours. It's very frustrating and it's getting harder to hide these episodes from Jeff.", "input": "", "output": "You still feel the need to hide your fears from your husband?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. No. I don't know. I'm really confused. When I look at him, I see the worry in his eyes. He's scared too although he won't admit it. He's trying hard to be strong for both of us and I just don't want to put anymore pressure on him. I need one of us to stay sane so I just try to keep the really nasty things from him. I know how hurt he would be if he knew some of the things that I was thinking.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "Lately it's mostly about Robby. How much of a jerk he is...how wonderful he is. How much I hate him...how much I love him.", "input": "", "output": "So you're still in love with Robby?"}, {"instruction": "No, I wouldn't say I was \"in love\" with Robby. I love him, he is Melissa's father, but I hate him too much to actually be in love with him.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you hate him so much?"}, {"instruction": "For the lies; for making me love him when he knew he was gay. Why would a man do that? Why would a man purposely encourage a woman to fall in love with him when he knew he was gay? I just don't understand!", "input": "", "output": "Could it be that Robby was confused about his sexuality?"}, {"instruction": "Confused? What was there to be confused about? He liked men. End of story.", "input": "", "output": "It's not that simple, Sarah. Sometimes people struggle with their sexuality their whole life."}, {"instruction": "Well I don't believe Robby was confused. He is a master of manipulation. He played with my emotions, treated me like dog, sucked every last breath out of me, then left me for dead!", "input": "", "output": "Those are pretty strong emotions, Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Yeah so?", "input": "", "output": "I'm a little concerned that you haven't put this part of your past behind you like you thought you had."}, {"instruction": "You're probably right, but you have to understand the course of events I went through to get to the point I'm at right now. For the first few years that Jeff and I were married, I refused to deal with Robby at all. Robby just didn't exist for me. Jeff was my husband, the father of my children, I didn't have a life before I married Jeff. I didn't have a past. My life began when I married Jeff.", "input": "", "output": "This seems like a good example of how you suppress stressful situations in your life."}, {"instruction": "Yes I suppose so, but it got me through. Otherwise I might not have made it this long.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "If I had let myself dwell on all the negative, I probably would have killed myself by now.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Do you have thoughts of suicide now?"}, {"instruction": "No not really. I'm afraid to die. I wouldn't have the nerve to do it now. Maybe if I could just lay down and go to sleep and never wake up--peaceful death would be nice, but I don't think I could do it to myself.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that. You know that I'm available anytime that you're in crisis."}, {"instruction": "I appreciate that Dr. Balis, but I don't think you have to worry about that.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Do you feel like talking about your relationship with Jeff?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose so. What do you want to know?", "input": "", "output": "Last week you stated that you had a stable relationship with your husband until Robby came back to town. Tell me more about your marriage to Jeff."}, {"instruction": "Well, when Jeff asked me to marry him I thought he was just being nice. Kind of doing me a favor, I guess. I appreciated it a lot. I was so scared and Jeff made me feel safe. What I didn't realize at the time was that Jeff really did love me. When he said our wedding vows, he really meant it.", "input": "", "output": "Didn't you take your vows seriously?"}, {"instruction": "I couldn't even tell you what our vows were so it's hard to say whether I took them seriously or not. As we were standing in front of the minister, I was trying to listen to what he was saying. He was talking about love and honor and a bunch of other crap. That's when he lost my attention. I knew then I was making a huge mistake but I couldn't move. I felt paralyzed from the brain down. Numb. I guess I said \"I do\" because it was all over with and there Jeff was staring down at me with these puppy dog eyes. He wanted to kiss me. We'd never kissed before and my first reaction was to push him away but I just stood there and let him kiss me. I stayed numb like that for the next 12 years. Feeling numb was better than feeling the pain.", "input": "", "output": "But Jeff has been a good husband?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, Jeff is a wonderful husband and a wonderful father. That's why it's been so hard having Robby back in my life. I don't want to hurt Jeff. He's always been there for me, sheltered and protected me. Made me feel safe and secure.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't love Jeff?"}, {"instruction": "No. I never have. I respect him, I care for him, I'm proud of him, I would do anything in the world for him...but no, I don't love him.", "input": "", "output": "Does Jeff know how you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I certainly hope not. I've made a life for him, my children, and myself based on these feelings. I don't want Jeff to know how much I've cheated him out of a real wife.", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think that's unfair?"}, {"instruction": "No not really. It takes very little to make Jeff happy. His happiness comes from making me happy. At least that's what he says.", "input": "", "output": "You sound as though you don't believe that."}, {"instruction": "I think Jeff believes it. But no. I don't think anyone's happiness should come from someone else. I think everyone should make their own happiness and not rely on other people to make them happy. That's a big burden to put on someone--make me happy.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you make Jeff happy?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I'm very good at playing this role.", "input": "", "output": "You feel as if you're playing a role?"}, {"instruction": "Of course it's a role. I have a script, I act it out, everyone's happy.", "input": "", "output": "What about your happiness? What makes you happy?"}, {"instruction": "It doesn't matter what makes me happy.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you say that?"}, {"instruction": "Because it's a fact. Right now, I'm paying the price for mistakes I made long ago. When I'm finished paying, I'll go on to the next stage of my life.", "input": "", "output": "Exactly what mistakes are you paying for?"}, {"instruction": "Haven't you heard what I've been saying? I married a man I didn't love, bore a child that wasn't his and ask him to raise it. Don't you think that's a horrible thing to do to someone?", "input": "", "output": "If you've made Jeff happy, do you really think that you're blameworthy?"}, {"instruction": "It's a false happiness. But I suppose that's better than no happiness at all. I've been playing this game for many years. I've gotten really good at it. Sometimes I even fool myself. Sometimes I can convinced myself that Jeff is the love of my life. Is that good or what?", "input": "", "output": "It sounds dangerous to me."}, {"instruction": "I suppose some would think that it was dangerous but this is my life. This is all I know.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, then tell me about the woman who plays the role of Sarah."}, {"instruction": "She doesn't exist any more.", "input": "", "output": "Then who is this person I'm speaking to?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, Sarah's soul is still here. Somewhere. When I first started working for Robby, the real me came back. That's when I had to start playing a double role. Sarah--the soft-spoken, non-opinionated wife and nurturing mother. Then there was the Sarah I really enjoyed. She was kind of crass and sassy. Had an opinion about everything. Stood up for what she believed in and didn't care much what other people thought about her.", "input": "", "output": "And this is the real Sarah?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I like her a lot better than the other Sarah.", "input": "", "output": "So with Jeff you were one person and when you were with Robby, you were a different person?"}, {"instruction": "Yup, you got it!", "input": "", "output": "And how long did you play this double role?"}, {"instruction": "About 3 years I think. Maybe closer to 4 years.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And it was during this time that you had the heart attack?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. But at that time, I had decided to give up the role of the real Sarah.", "input": "", "output": "Why was that?"}, {"instruction": "Because I realized Robby was sucking me dry and that it was not a healthy relationship to be in. I gave him 4 months notice that I was quitting, knowing full well that after I quit, we wouldn't see each other for a very long time.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me how you came to be working for Robby."}, {"instruction": "My sister was working as a receptionist for old Dr. Waite. She went on maternity leave and got me to fill in for her. It was just part time and I was already working for another dentist part time so I figured I could handle both jobs for a few months. After she had the baby, she decided not to come back to work. It wasn't too bad working for both the doctors so I decided to stay on with Dr. Waite. Then about 6 months later, Dr. Waite had a stroke and retired. That's when Robby came back home and took over his practice.", "input": "", "output": "How did you feel about working for Robby?"}, {"instruction": "At first, when I found out he was the one who bought Dr. Waite's practice, I was going to quit. I wrestled with it for a long time. I still hadn't made up my mind until I actually came face to face with him.", "input": "", "output": "What happened when you saw him that first time?"}, {"instruction": "It was really disturbing. All kinds of emotions starting going around and around in my head. I had forgotten how absolutely gorgeous he was. Sandy blonde hair, ice blue eyes...", "input": "", "output": "So it was more of a physically attraction?"}, {"instruction": "Oh no, it was much more than that. I knew from that first moment we'd known each other in another life.", "input": "", "output": "Excuse me?"}, {"instruction": "Well I wasn't sure before, when we were just dating, but this time I could look into his eyes and see something I recognized.", "input": "", "output": "What exactly did you recognize?"}, {"instruction": "My soul knew his soul. It was beyond anything that my physical being had any control over. It was like...it was like suddenly there were now 2 other people in the room with us. My physical self, Robby's physical self, and each of our spiritual selves as well. Our souls knew each other. They wanted to be with each other. There's always a very strong bond between souls, and sometimes the souls will react totally differently than the physical being would have it. It becomes a struggle between the spiritual and physical self.", "input": "", "output": "So you believe in reincarnation?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, very much so. I've lived at least 3 other lives that I can remember. Probably more.", "input": "", "output": "And do you believe Robby's soul was involved in those lives as well?"}, {"instruction": "Definitely!", "input": "", "output": "And what do you believe was the relationship you had with Robby in those previous lives?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I wondered about that for a long time myself. I just couldn't put a time or place on it, but I knew it was good. I started having strange dreams that I now believe were glimpses of my past.", "input": "", "output": "What did those dreams tell you?"}, {"instruction": "We were in love, but there was some reason we couldn't be together. Something that kept us apart, though I don't know what it was. We were always being pulled apart, kept apart really. We struggled to stay together but there was always something coming between us. In one life, we lived in a European country...Scotland maybe, I'm not sure. It was hundreds of years ago but at the time, Robby was a Catholic priest. We fell in love but he couldn't or wouldn't break his vows to be with me. I was angry at him and eventually killed myself to punish him. I remember my death. I remember being told I had made the wrong choice and had to go back and try again.", "input": "", "output": "The part about the two of you being keep apart, it seems like the same thing is happening in the present."}, {"instruction": "Exactly. That's why, when I finally figured it all out, I had to make the changes. I believe that when we are born, we always come with the same soul. We have lessons to learn from life to life. If we don't learn from our lessons, we have to repeat them. I know now that in this life, the circle with Robby will be completed.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by completed?"}, {"instruction": "Both of us will have learned all we can from each other. We will be rewarded by being together forever. Our souls will never be separated again.", "input": "", "output": "If this is what you truly believe, why aren't you continuing your relationship with Robby?"}, {"instruction": "Because it's not time yet. Many things must first happen before we can be together. Our time will come but not yet.", "input": "", "output": "So in the meantime, you continue to live with a man you don't love and you've created a canyon between you and the man you do love."}, {"instruction": "Yes but all this is necessary.", "input": "", "output": "But you really don't hate Robby?"}, {"instruction": "I hate what Robby has become, but my soul will always love his soul no matter what the physical or emotional aspects are. It's all part of the learning process.", "input": "", "output": "Does Robby believe as you do, that you have known each other before?"}, {"instruction": "No but he will. Just before it's over, he'll know. I will be caring for him at his death and at that moment he'll recognize my soul.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I'm afraid our time is up for today. Do you want to come back next week at the same time?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, that'll be fine.", "input": "", "output": "All right, I'll see you next Monday at 2:00pm."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Bye Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sarah.  Oh I'd like an opportunity to talk to your cardiologist, if you don't mind.  Could you give me his name and number?"}, {"instruction": "Sure Doctor.  Actually, I have one of his business cards in my purse.  Here it is.  Bye Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you.  Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "I'd rather stand if you don't mind. I just have so much nervous energy today I need to keep moving. I get like this sometimes. Either I'm so down I don't want to get out of bed or I'm like this...just pacing back and forth. I don't know which is worse. I guess it's better than crying. I just don't know what to do. I had the strangest dream the other night. It was one of those dreams that you just can't get out of your head. It just keeps running through my mind over and over. It's been making me crazy. I'm sorry I guess I'm rambling. Maybe I should sit down after all.", "input": "", "output": "Whatever makes you comfortable. Do you want to tell me about the dream?"}, {"instruction": "I dreamed that I was handcuffed in a wheelchair and had to depend on Jeff to push me around, only when he wasn't looking I could take off the handcuffs and walk by myself. People were so surprised to see me walking but I couldn't let Jeff know about it. I felt so sneaky, yet I also thought it was funny.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think the dream meant?"}, {"instruction": "It describes my life perfectly. Jeff treats me like a invalid. He doesn't think I can move on my own, make decisions on my own. He doesn't believe I can even think for myself. But I know what I'm capable of, which is a lot more than he realizes.", "input": "", "output": "Have you told Jeff how you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, many times over the last few years. I've tried to tell him how much he embarrasses me and makes me feel stupid in front of others. Like a few weeks ago we had friends over for dinner and we were sitting around having coffee. These are our closest friends, my friend Lisa and her husband Glen. Anyway we were discussing our plans to go on a camping trip together, their family and ours. We were deciding who would bring what, and we discovered that neither of us had a camp-type coffee pot. We're big coffee drinkers. So I volunteered to purchase one and Jeff says, \"Honey, those camp coffee pots are expensive, maybe you should check them out before you volunteer to buy one.\" Well, I was furious! I said, \"Excuse me, but I do have a job and if I want to spend a thousand dollars on a coffee pot, that's what I'll do!\" Jeff just laughed but I was so embarrassed. After Lisa and Glen left I ripped him apart! I told him never to treat me like that in front of people again. Oh, I could give you a million examples of how he's made me feel stupid. And how many times he's lied to me....it just makes my head swim.", "input": "", "output": "Jeff has lied to you on occasion?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, if he thinks it will make his point better. Like if I say there's a new movie I'd like to see, Jeff will say, \"Bill's already seen it and said it wasn't very good.\" Yet when I see Bill, he says he's never seen the movie.", "input": "", "output": "When you catch Jeff in a lie, do you talk to him about it?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but he'll just say something like, \"Oh maybe it wasn't Bill. It must've been someone else.\" I get right in his face and say \"Bullshit!\" He just laughs. It makes me so angry! He doesn't take anything I say seriously. It makes me so mad I just want to scream!", "input": "", "output": "You've said in past sessions that you thought Jeff was a good husband, yet what you're describing sounds like you don't think that he respects you.  Is that really a good husband?"}, {"instruction": "Jeff is a good person. He doesn't drink or run around on me or abuse me.", "input": "", "output": "Are those the only qualifications for a good husband?"}, {"instruction": "No, I suppose not.", "input": "", "output": "It would seem to me that you and Jeff have a problem with communication."}, {"instruction": "Yes I would agree, and I'm trying to make changes. I think Jeff is scared. He knows things are changing between us and he doesn't know if it will be for the better or worse. I'm not sure myself, but I know I have to do something. I'm scared too, but I'm ready to accept whatever happens.", "input": "", "output": "What sort of changes have you been going through?"}, {"instruction": "Well in the past I would never contradict anything he said. I'd never question his judgment or question his authority. But some days I feel strong enough to stand up to him, stand up for myself.", "input": "", "output": "And this is what Jeff doesn't like?"}, {"instruction": "No, he doesn't like it at all. But I don't care anymore. I know that whatever happens will be for the best in the end. My fate will remain the same whether I'm with Jeff or not.", "input": "", "output": "Have you thought about leaving Jeff?"}, {"instruction": "Yes once. Robby was worried that his homosexuality was going to cost him his practice. He's very careful about hiding his sexuality. I wanted to leave Jeff and marry Robby as a \"front\" so that he could continue his relationships with men without jeopardizing his career.", "input": "", "output": "And Robby turned your offer down?"}, {"instruction": "Not right away, but yes. I was crushed. I wanted to be with him so badly I didn't care what the circumstances were. Of course now I realize what a huge mistake that would have been for both of us. I was trying too hard to rush things. I know patience is a virtue but it's never been one of mine.", "input": "", "output": "So how would you describe the current relationship between you and Jeff?"}, {"instruction": "Guarded I'd say. He knows what I've been going through since my heart attack, although he doesn't realize the depth of my anxiety. I will admit that he's been very supportive. At least he's trying to be, which for Jeff is a big step. We talk more than we used to, and I'm able to tell him certain things that I've always been afraid to say in the past. I guess I've just gotten to the point where I will say or do anything because I don't care what he thinks anymore. I'm still working on getting him to understand that our problems are real, that they're not going to go away by themselves, and that he has to stop putting the blame on everyone else.", "input": "", "output": "Who does he blame for the problems you're having?"}, {"instruction": "Everyone, but mostly Robby or my friend Lisa. Actually she gets the brunt of it.", "input": "", "output": "What does Jeff see as Lisa's role in all this?"}, {"instruction": "He thinks that Lisa is the one who has put all these \"ideas\" in my head, like I'm not capable of thinking for myself. I think Jeff is jealous and intimidated by Lisa. She's very intelligent and Jeff doesn't deal well with intelligent women. Although he does respect the women that he works with, which I've always resented. I get really tired of hearing about Renee and Janet, the two women in his department. Neither of them are married or have children. They work hard and earn as much as he does. See, that's been a sore spot with me also. Because I don't make as much money as he does, my job is not as important. He sees my job as a hobby, not as a responsibility I have. My job gives me a sense of accomplishment and pride which Jeff thinks should come solely from being a wife and mother. He wants me to be more like his mother.", "input": "", "output": "Has Jeff told you that?"}, {"instruction": "No, but he sees his mother as the picture-perfect example of motherhood. Hear him tell it, he had the perfect childhood. Whatever was done for him as a child will be done for our children...no more, no less. I was raised totally different. My parents are both professors. Both open-minded and uninhibited. They never put limits on us kids or made us feel less of a person for the way we felt. Growing up, I had very few restrictions. I was encouraged to explore and examine the world around me. We had a very unstructured, but extremely loving household. On the other hand, Jeff grew up in a very formal environment. Meatloaf every Tuesday, church on Sunday, never go to bed without brushing your teeth.", "input": "", "output": "You and Jeff disagree about how to raise your children?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, sometimes. For the most part I just go along with the flow, but there have been times when I have stood up for something I really believed in. When we were buying our first house, I wanted 4 bedrooms so that each of the kids could have their own room. Jeff just had a fit! He said when he was growing up he had to share a room with his brother, therefore J.J. and Nicolas had to share a room too.", "input": "", "output": "What do you say?"}, {"instruction": "I said, \"Well, I didn't have to share a room with either of my sisters.\" But Jeff gets a nasty sneer on his face like he's thinking, \"Yeah and look how you guys all turned out.\" Jeff avoids my family like the plague. He says my folks are creepy and my sisters are psychotic. He says it's a wonder I turned out as normal as I am. I think he means that in a good way but it comes out sounding like a backhanded compliment.", "input": "", "output": "So how many bedrooms did you end up with?"}, {"instruction": "Four but we use one as an office. The boys are still sharing a room. Jeff saw that as a reasonable compromise.", "input": "", "output": "And this is okay with you?"}, {"instruction": "No it's not okay, but right now there's nothing I can do about it. I feel myself getting stronger as the weeks and months go by and I challenge Jeff more and more. I don't feel the need to correct past mistakes but I am trying to keep from making those mistakes again. I know that I am becoming a better person--someone I like and respect--and to me that's all that matters right now.", "input": "", "output": "The transformations that you want to make are going to be difficult. It's not going to be easy to break the habits that you and Jeff have gotten in to."}, {"instruction": "Yes I realize that, but these changes have to be made if I'm to survive. For so many years I felt beaten and run down. That black cloud just hung over me but I know it is fading and one day it will disappear totally. At least that's what I'm hoping for.", "input": "", "output": "Well our time is over for today. I'd like to see you again next week if that's okay."}, {"instruction": "Next Monday at the same time?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, that will be fine. That's October 14th at 2 pm.  See you then."}, {"instruction": "Not too bad, I guess. No worse than usual so I'm thankful for that.", "input": "", "output": "Is there anything particular you'd like to talk about today?"}, {"instruction": "I had another strange dream the other night. This one really hit me hard. I was in a bedroom...I didn't recognize the room. It was dark, except for the moonlight coming through a small window, and there were sheer drapes surrounding the bed. There was a breeze blowing the drapes all around. I couldn't see who was in the bed but I felt I knew this person. I walked over to the bed and drew the drapes to the side and Robby was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the bed.", "input": "", "output": "Was that the end of the dream?"}, {"instruction": "No. Suddenly we were making love. It was wonderful! I kept thinking, \"Finally I'm with the man I love.\" When we were finished making love, Robby slapped me across the face and dragged me by my hair over to a mirror. He held me in front of this mirror and said, \"There, are you happy now?\" He was so angry! I was afraid he would really hurt me!", "input": "", "output": "Did Robby ever abuse you when you were dating?"}, {"instruction": "No, that's why I was so surprised. He let go of me and when I turned around Robby was back on the bed, this time making love to 5 or 6 different men. They all looked at me and laughed. I started crying and screaming at Robby to stop, but he just kept laughing. When I woke up, I was still crying.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think the dream means?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure. I've been thinking about the first time Robby and I made love. Maybe that's where the dream came from?", "input": "", "output": "There's some similarity between the dream and the first time you and Robby had sex?"}, {"instruction": "Well, that's not what happened, but it was just as embarassing.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "It was time for my Senior Prom and I wanted Robby to take me. He didn't want to go--said it was childish--so we compromised. He agreed to take me to some of the after parties. At the first party we stopped at, Robby proceded to get extremely drunk. I never saw him drink so much and I got really pissed! This was suppose to me my night and Robby was such an ass. He was flirting with every girl at this party and trying to set up dates with them for the following weekend! Of course they all knew that Robby and I were dating so they just laughed him off, but I was embarassed.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I can see how that would be embarassing. What happened then?"}, {"instruction": "When I finally dragged him out of there, I decided to just take him home. By this time I was so angry I didn't care if I ever saw him again! I got him home and helped him up the stairs to his bedroom. He was only semi-drunk by this time and I had cooled off somewhat. As we sat on the edge of the bed, Robby put his arms around me and started kissing me. We had been in some pretty steamy embraces before that, but Robby never let it get too far. This time the limits were off! I knew we would make love that night. We rolled around on the bed for quite some time and when Robby decided it was time--that's what he told me, \"It's time\"--I held my breath and waited for the pain I thought would come with losing my virginity. Not knowing what exactly to expect, I was sadly disappointed to realize Robby didn't have an erection. He tried and tried to enter me but nothing worked, all the while he grumbled and mumbled under his breath. I thought he was probably just too drunk to get it up and I finally said, \"Let's just wait for another time.\" But he was determined.", "input": "", "output": "Had you changed your mind? Did he try to take you by force?"}, {"instruction": "No, it wasn't anything like that! I just thought both of us would be better prepared if we waited but, since he seemed so anxious, I went along with what he wanted. He asked me to perform oral sex on him and I did; it seemed to work, so then Robby said, \"it's time\" again, but this time he asked me to roll over on my stomach. A million thoughts were going through my head, but I complied. This time he got it right, but he was like an animal, almost savage, and when it was over I was relieved. It wasn't what I had expected or hoped for and I wasn't sure I wanted to have a repeat performance.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do after that?"}, {"instruction": "I left Robby sleeping in his bed and went home. I laid awake all that night thinking about what happened. I was sure it was the alcohol that had made him act so strangely, so I tried to put it out of my head and hoped that the next time would be better.", "input": "", "output": "Was there a next time?"}, {"instruction": "Yes and it was the last time too. It was about a month later on a Friday night and Robby and I were sitting at his place watching some old black and white movie on TV. During a commercial Robby jumps up and says, \"I just remembered something a friend gave me,\" and he ran upstairs. I didn't think too much of it but when he came back down he had a video tape in his hand. I asked what it was and he told me it was a boot-leg copy of some adult erotica movie. Being the naive person that I was I said, \"Well, let's see what it is.\" I had never seen an X-rated movie before, so I was kind of in shock when I saw what it was. I just remember one woman having sex with two men, then another woman came in and all four of them were going at each other. First the women started kissing and touching each other, then the two guys started doing the same. When the one guy took the other guy into his mouth, that's when I said, \"Turn it off!\"", "input": "", "output": "What did Robby do? Did he turn it off?"}, {"instruction": "He just laughed but he did turn it off after another 10 or 15 minutes. I got up and went into the kitchen; I just couldn't stand to watch such garbage. It was starting to get late by this time and I told Robby I had to get home. I leaned over to kiss him good night and he pulled me down on his lap. That's when I noticed he had an erection. He said, \"You don't want to leave me like this, do you?\" and he took my hand and put it on his crotch. Within a few minutes we both had our clothes off and were making out on the sofa. He picked me up and carried me upstairs to his bedroom. By this time I was really aroused and thought it was very romantic that he carried me to the bed. I was in love with him and I thought, finally, we were taking our relationship to the next level. I thought it was unusual that he asked me again to roll over on my stomach, but I figured it shouldn't make any difference, so I did. This time he went slow and gentle, at least in the beginning. Toward the end he got a little rough, but it was after he had finished that I got worried.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "He laid there on top of me for a few minutes catching his breath, then he said, \"Oh my God,\" and ran into the bathroom and started vomiting. Of course I'm laying there thinking, \"What is going on?\" I wrapped a sheet around me and went to the bathroom door to see if he was all right. He wouldn't answer me, so I threatened to kick the door down if he didn't unlock it and let me in. I heard water running and finally he opened the door. He looked awful. His face was pale and his hair was a mess. I put my hand to his forehead to see if perhaps he had a fever. He felt kind of clammy and I suggested he get back in bed, to which he agreed. I figured he was getting some flu bug or something and I didn't want to get it, so I tucked him in bed, kissed him on the check, and went home. I didn't hear from him the rest of the weekend. I tried calling but never got an answer. I was starting to get worried when he finally called me Sunday evening. He confirmed my suspicions and said he thought he had gotten food poisoning or something. We made a date for the following weekend, but he didn't keep the date.", "input": "", "output": "Why didn't he keep the date?"}, {"instruction": "Wednesday of that week he called and said he was going away to school. I was surprised since it was the first time he had mentioned anything about going to school. He told me he needed to go to the campus that weekend to register and find a place to live. Within three weeks he was gone. And I was pregnant. As they say, \"And the rest is history!\"", "input": "", "output": "Looking back, what are your feelings on what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Although I never wanted to admit it, I suppose Robby was struggling with his sexuality all along. I think he used me as a test of some sort. Obviously making love to me made him physically ill, so he went with his gut instinct and ran off to be free of me and find a life more suited to his real inclinations.", "input": "", "output": "What were the circumstances when Robby actually told you of his homosexuality?"}, {"instruction": "Well, like I told you before, at one point while I was working for him, I felt I was falling in love with him again...not again really because I never really stopped loving him. The feelings I had for him began to surface again. We were getting along so well and it felt so right to be with him. I convinced myself that what I had witnessed years earlier between him and his roommate was all just my imagination. It was his birthday and I took him out for lunch. He didn't have any patients scheduled for the afternoon, so after lunch we went back to his house and had a few beers to celebrate. We were just a little tipsy, at least I was--not drunk or anything, but I decided this was the best time to tell him how I was feeling. I barely got a word out of mouth when Robby said, \"Sarah, as much as I care for you, you have to know a relationship between us won't work.\" I immediately thought it was because I was married to his former best friend and I started rattling on about not hurting Jeff, but that after all these years we deserved to have a life together.", "input": "", "output": "That wasn't what he meant?"}, {"instruction": "No.  He took my face in his heads and looked me right in the eye and said, \"No Sarah, this had nothing to do with Jeff. I'm gay.\" I thought he was lying just to get rid of me and I told him so, but he started telling me how his life had been since he realized he was gay. He told me that when his other friends started noticing the girls, he started to notice the boys. He told me a lot of things that afternoon and, when he was finished, I was convinced. No one could make up the pain and torrment that he had been through. We both cried.", "input": "", "output": "How did it make you feel to finally realize Robby was gay?"}, {"instruction": "That's a hard question. Perhaps we could save that until next week?

They have fucked up my life for the last 15 years.", "input": "", "output": "Sarah please tell me what happened."}, {"instruction": "Sure. We got a new answering machine last week. Our old one just died, so Jeff got one of those new ones that does everything. It has caller ID and last number memory re-dial...all that neat stuff. Well, Saturday morning I'm cleaning house and doing laundry. Jeff plays golf on Saturday mornings. No wait, that's not exactly true. I thought Jeff was playing golf, but it turns out he was playing with Robby. I guess he had a better chance of getting a \"Hole-in-One!\" with Robby than he did on the golf course! So anyway, I picked up the answering machine to dust the table underneath and I accidentally hit last number dialed. It flashes the number, day and time. I recognized the number right away. It was Robby's number. The call was made that morning, right before Jeff left the house. I must have been in the laundry room. I'm thinking to myself, \"Who the hell called Robby?\" Okay, so this was really bad of me, but I remembered one time when we were out to lunch and he called the office to get his messages. I remembered his code was #22. I wasn't sure what I was doing, or what I might find, but I hit the re-dial button and got Robby's answering machine. When it beeped, I put the code in and sure enough it still worked. There were four messages on his machine. Two was business related, one was his sister, and the last one was from Jeff.", "input": "", "output": "Why was Jeff calling Robby?"}, {"instruction": "To tell him he was running a little late that morning but would be there as soon as he could. At first I thought maybe they were just meeting to hash over all the old bullshit. They haven't talked much since Robby came back to town; well, Jeff always said he was uncomfortable knowing his best friend was gay. I don't know what I thought really. There just didn't seem to be a logical answer and I was trying to make some sense out of it.", "input": "", "output": "What made you come to the conclusion that Jeff and Robby are lovers?"}, {"instruction": "At first it was just a gut feeling. I called my friend Lisa and told her what I had done and what I suspected. She thought I was nuts! She told me to take my medicine and call my shrink then she hung up on me. She called me back a few minutes later and apologized, but anyway we decided to take a drive by Robby's house. Lisa figured it would satisfy my curiosity to go by and see that Jeff was not there.", "input": "", "output": "Was Jeff there?"}, {"instruction": "Well we weren't sure at first. We didn't see his car, but I had a feeling it might have been parked in the garage, so we drove around the back alley and Lisa jumped out to look in the garage window. When she got back in the car, I knew without asking she had seen Jeff's car. Her face was totally white! She said, \"Let's get the hell out of here!\"", "input": "", "output": "What happened then?"}, {"instruction": "I wanted to watch for Jeff to come out of the house, but I was afraid he'd see my car, so we went back to Lisa's house and borrowed her husband's car. We drove back to Robby's house and parked down the street. Jeff was still there, and we waited for almost 2 hours before he finally came out. The garage door started going up, and just as it reached about the half way point, I could see them both fairly clearly. Jeff was already in the car and Robby leaned in and kissed him.", "input": "", "output": "Did you confront Jeff with what you witnessed?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, you better believe I confronted him! I got back home and called my mother to come get the kids. I didn't want them to be around when Jeff got home. Apparently he did go play golf, but it was after he played with Robby. He walked in the back door and I was sitting at the kitchen table having a cup of coffee. I asked how his game went and he said, \"Not bad.\" I said, \"That's good. How was your visit your Robby?\" You should have seen the look on his face! It was priceless! His knees actually went limp and I thought he was going to faint. I loved it!", "input": "", "output": "What did he say?"}, {"instruction": "He recovered quickly and naturally tried to deny it. I let him go on and on, telling me he had no idea what I was talking about. He said, \"Sarah, I think you've finally gone over the edge.\" I just sat there very calmly and listened to his bullshit. \"I know you've been having a lot of problems lately, but I think you've gone too far this time. What the hell do you think I am...\" Then right in the middle of his sermon I said, \"Jeff stop it. I've seen you two kissing.\" He just stood there staring at me, then he turned around and went back out the door. That was the last I've seen or heard from him since Saturday.", "input": "", "output": "What do you plan to do now?"}, {"instruction": "I told you. I'm going to kill both of them.", "input": "", "output": "Sarah, you don't really mean that."}, {"instruction": "Yes I do. I just haven't decided how to do it yet.", "input": "", "output": "Sarah, you're not thinking straight right now. Think about what you're saying. What about your children? How will they feel if you kill their father?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm certainly not going to tell them I killed their father.  I've thought about this calmly and dispassionately.  It's the right answer. It'll have to be an accident of some sort. Maybe cut the brake line on his car or something. No, the cops always figure that one out. I have to give this some more thought.", "input": "", "output": "Well, perhaps some time away would do you some good. You are under a time of enormous stress which can't be good for your heart in addition to your peace of mind.  I know of a place in St. Helena in the wine country which could be just the place for you to get your thinking together. You'll feel a lot better if you can get some rest and really sort out how you feel and what you want to do."}, {"instruction": "Oh thanks that's nice, but really I feel fine. Anyway the sooner I get this over with, the better I'll feel. In fact, I'd better get going. I have to stop at the hardware store on the way home this afternoon. The mice are acting up and I was thinking about some poison. Next week same time okay with you?", "input": "", "output": "Sarah, you've come here obviously in crisis.  As I understand what you've told me, the cornerstone of your belief system has just been knocked out by your husband and by the man you love.  You are acting a lot like somebody suffering from emotional shock, which is understandable.  But you can't pretend to be calmly analytical when you are plotting a rage double murder.  Can you skip the rat poison for a moment and just talk to me?"}, {"instruction": "Sure Doc.  I didn't mean to upset you.  What do you want to talk about?", "input": "", "output": "Well I want to be sure that you aren't actually serious about trying to harm either Robby or Jeff.  That's not a solution here."}, {"instruction": "Don't you think just a tiny bit of castration would be fair turnabout?  No Doctor.  Don't worry.  It's just a fantasy.  I'm sure that Jeff and I are going to come to some reasonable understanding.  As you said, there's the kids to think about after all.  See?  I'm calm and rational.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps you would like me to prescribe something for you to get over the rough spots?"}, {"instruction": "Well I've been taking the Xanax and that seems fine to me.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been feeling any chest pain or breathlessness?"}, {"instruction": "Actually it's a bit surprising, but physically I feel fine.  Robust even.  Somehow this event has energized me.  I feel like a new woman.  And I really do have to go, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "If I let you just walk out of here, you aren't going to do anything rash, are you?"}, {"instruction": "Rash?  Well I might I guess.  But I won't kill anybody Doctor.  I promise.  Set your mind at ease.", "input": "", "output": "Can you call me tomorrow?  I'd like to hear from you about how things are going.  And I'd like to hear from you when Jeff returns."}, {"instruction": "Sure Doc.  I'll be sure to call you if I need to, okay?  And I'll see you next week at this time.", "input": "", "output": "You've been through quite a shock.  I'd really like it if you checked in with me tomorrow.  We can work through this thing."}, {"instruction": "Thanks Dr. B. I'm glad to be back.  Thanks for making time for me today.", "input": "", "output": "I was happy to.  I'm sorry that you can only stay half an hour.  You've had several bombshells fall on you over the last few weeks. How are you feeling?"}, {"instruction": "I'm doing okay, I think. Just taking one day at a time right now.", "input": "", "output": "That's good to hear. Last time we talked you said Jeff had asked you to allow Robby to move into your home during his illness. Have you made a decision about that situation?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Robby is moving in this weekend.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? So quickly? Has his illness taken a turn for the worse already?"}, {"instruction": "No, actually Robby is feeling fairly well physically. Mentally he's a mess. He's been given a death sentence. He knows he'll die.", "input": "", "output": "Have you gone for your HIV test yet, Sarah?"}, {"instruction": "I have an appointment tomorrow.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Better to get that out of the way as soon as possible."}, {"instruction": "Yes, but I'm not too concerned about it. Like I told you, Jeff has already been tested and he's clean, so chances are I'm okay, too.", "input": "", "output": "So tell me what living arrangements you have made with Jeff and Robby."}, {"instruction": "Well, we have a small apartment above our garage. Originally it was going to be for my parents or Jeff's parents when they could no longer live in their own homes. A \"mother-in-law\" apartment! Anyway, Jeff uses it mostly for storage right now, so Robby will move in there. Of course, Robby has to sell his dental practice. I think that's the toughest for him right now. He's feeling a lot of guilt, as well he should.", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be taking this whole thing very well, Sarah. You're allowing your husband's gay lover to move into your home. This is a big decision to make. Are you sure about all this?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, I'm sure. This is the way it's suppose to end. I always knew that Robby and I would be together at his death...of course, I didn't realize what our relationship would be at the time of his death.", "input": "", "output": "You're talking about your belief in reincarnation?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Robby and I have lived many life times together, always kept apart for some reason. I can only hope we have both learned our lessons in this lifetime, and will be allowed to be together in our next.", "input": "", "output": "And Robby does not share this view?"}, {"instruction": "No, but men always have a harder time accepting things they can't logically or scientifically explain. But in the end he'll recognize me and he'll go knowing he'll see me again soon.", "input": "", "output": "Soon? Are you saying your death will occur soon after Robby's?"}, {"instruction": "No, not like that, but death just seems a short nap compared to living a long life. It will seem like soon for Robby.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So what are your plans now?"}, {"instruction": "I've given my notice at work. I'm going to stay until the end of the year, but then I'll be home to help take care of Robby as he needs me.", "input": "", "output": "So Robby is just going to become like a family member? What have told your children?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the kids have known Robby for years. He's been to the house many times. I guess you could say he was already like family...except toward the end when I hated him so much. But the kids know Robby is going to be living above the garage and that he's not going to be a dentist anymore. We've told them he's very sick, although we haven't said what he has. At this point, I don't want a load of shit from anyone about having a man with AIDS living in our house.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, that's probably a wise decision. Will you and Jeff have to support Robby financially?"}, {"instruction": "No, thank goodness. Apparently Robby has been able to create quite a little nest egg for himself, which is a good thing since when his medications come in, he'll have to pay an arm and leg, and we certainly can't afford to help him in that way. The money we have saved is for the kids' college. We're not touching that!", "input": "", "output": "I'm very curious to know what the relationship between Jeff and Robby will be while Robby is living with you."}, {"instruction": "Well, they're in love, you know, so I suppose they'll maintain some sort of physical relationship, although I know for a fact Jeff won't risk contacting AIDS from Robby. This has really scared him! He's clean and he's going to stay that way! I don't know much about AIDS, but I imagine in the end Robby will be too sick to have any sort of relationship with Jeff.", "input": "", "output": "So what is the current standing of the relationship between you and Jeff?"}, {"instruction": "What relationship? Whatever we had is over. The only reason I'm letting him stay is because of the kids. The kids love their dad and it would be cruel to pull them away from him. Jeff and I have talked about this and neither of us wants the kids to know that Jeff is gay. At least not now. Maybe later when they're older.", "input": "", "output": "I can understand letting Jeff stay, but why are letting Robby stay, too?"}, {"instruction": "Like I said before, this is fate working. I cannot go against what is woven into the spokes of life. It will be interesting to see how this develops. Living in the same house with a man I've loved most of my life, who's now dying of AIDS, and who happens to be in love with my husband. Sounds like something from a friggin' soap opera!", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure you will be able to handle all that is bound to come with this living arrangement?"}, {"instruction": "No, but that's why I have you Dr. B.", "input": "", "output": "Yes Sarah, you'll always have me."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, I appreciate your support. The half hour's up and I have to get back.  Can I make an appointment for the same time as my usual session next week?", "input": "", "output": "Of course, I'll see you then. Let's see, that's November 25th at 2 pm.  Goodbye Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Thanks Dr. B. I could use some comfort today.", "input": "", "output": "Rough weekend?"}, {"instruction": "Robby moved in this weekend.", "input": "", "output": "I see. How did that go?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, the moving part went fine. I took the day off from work on Friday so I could get the apartment cleaned up. Jeff and Robby got all the big stuff moved on Saturday. The apartment is kind of small so Robby doesn't have room for a lot of his things. I think when he sells his house, he'll have to have an auction to unload the rest of the crap.", "input": "", "output": "What arrangements has Robby made about his dental practice?"}, {"instruction": "He just rents the office, so that's no big deal. He is sending a letter to all his patients saying he is retiring and recommending they allow their records to be transferred to the office of Dr. Martha Grant. She just opened an office over on Geary Street and she's agreed to take over his patients. It helps Robby out of a tight spot, and Martha will get a good start, too. It'll work out for both of them.", "input": "", "output": "How did things go emotionally this weekend?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, there really wasn't much time for emotional baggage. Too much work to do. I did get a chance to speak with Robby alone though, and that was pretty heart-wrenching.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Last night Jeff went to the office to catch up on some work. I was going to start the laundry so I went up to see if Robby had anything to be washed. He seemed a little uncomfortable being alone with me. Anyway, he told me how much he appreciates my letting him move into the apartment, especially under the circumstances.", "input": "", "output": "What was your reaction?"}, {"instruction": "I really didn't know what to say, so I didn't saying anything. I just stood there staring at him. Finally he said, \"Sarah, it's not like you to be speechless. I know you're hurting too. Say what's on your mind.\" The last 15 years went through my mind like a videotape on fast-forward. It's hard to believe this is the same man I've known since high school. It's hard to believe one person can bring such joy and such sorrow in the same lifetime.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell Robby what you were thinking?"}, {"instruction": "No, there's just too many things I haven't resolved in my mind yet. I'd rather not say anything right now. I have two reactions to difficult situations: either I break down and cry, or I yell and scream. Neither are effective means of communication. I turned around and walked out.", "input": "", "output": "You realize this living arrangement is going to be extremely...."}, {"instruction": "Nerve-wracking? Heartbreaking? Yes, I've already thought about all that. Nothing to do with Robby will be easy from now on. I know it will be difficult to stand by and watch him die.", "input": "", "output": "Has Robby started any drug therapy for his illness yet?"}, {"instruction": "Yes....I think so, but I'm not sure what it is. Jeff was trying to tell me about it, but I can't stand to be in the same room with him anymore, so I wasn't really listening.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think is going to be more difficult; living with Jeff or living with Robby?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure. Living with Robby I imagine will be the hardest part. Seeing his health deteriorate, watching him cling to life. I have no feelings for Jeff so being in the same house with him won't effect me one way or another. Of course, Jeff is sucking up to me big time. Seeing him so humbled makes me laugh inside. I told him the only reason he is still living in the house is because of the kids. I refuse to allow my children's lives to be torn apart over this. Jeff is more of an annoyance to me than anything else and he knows it. He'll do anything to keep on my good side. A big change from the way things have been between us over the last 15 years! I set down some rules for him and he has sworn to abide by whatever I want.", "input": "", "output": "Rules? What sort of rules?"}, {"instruction": "Mostly concerning physical contact with Robby if the kids or I are anywhere near. I know that neither of them will risk Jeff getting AIDS, but I still don't want the kids or myself to see them in a compromising position.", "input": "", "output": "What other rules did you set down?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, mostly just bullshit. I was making them up as I went along. Actually it was kind of fun. I'm finally in a position of control over Jeff and it feels wonderful! I told Jeff that this was my game now, and we'd all play by my rules or we wouldn't play at all. One of the things I told him was that I wanted $300 deposited into my private account every week. Since I'm not going to be working, I want some compensation for taking care of his sick lover. He asked me what I was going to use the money for and I told him it was none of his business. He laughed right in my face and said, \"You're not getting any more money out of me than you need to run this house.\" That was the wrong thing to say to me. I slapped him upside the head so quick he never saw it coming! It was great!", "input": "", "output": "You hit your husband?"}, {"instruction": "No, I didn't hit my husband! I hit Jeff....he's no more my husband than you are. A husband doesn't do the things to his wife that Jeff has done to me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you really think resorting to physical abuse is going to make the situation any better?"}, {"instruction": "Oh please! Don't talk to me about abuse! What the hell have I been through the last 15 years? Emotional, verbal, psychological abuse! It's pay-back time! If I can protect myself, I will use whatever is necessary.", "input": "", "output": "Sarah, I understand how you feel, but you're not in physical danger from Jeff. How can you justify hitting him?"}, {"instruction": "Look, all I did was give him a good slap across the head. I didn't hurt him. All it did was get his attention. And it will teach him not to laugh at me anymore. I have to set some precedents for the way things are going to be from now on. I've been under his thumb for so long and I'm not about to let him take advantage of me ever again. He'll soon learn his place and then I won't have to worry about it again.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you know what you're doing."}, {"instruction": "Well I've certainly never heard or seen a situation like this, so I'm not sure of the proper ettiquette. I don't think Emily Post has written anything about this. How does a woman treat her gay husband? How does a woman treat the man she loves who is dying of AIDS? I'm trying to keep the two issues separate. The man I'm married to is in love with another man. To me that is totally separate from the fact that the man I love has AIDS. I try not to think about the fact that they are the same person for both of us. I will treat Jeff like the dog he is, and I'll do my best to be there for Robby if and when he needs me.", "input": "", "output": "If I may ask a personal question Sarah, what is the purpose of having Jeff deposit money into a private account? Don't you normally have access to Jeff's money?"}, {"instruction": "Are you joking? Jeff gives me just enough money every week to buy groceries. No more, no less. I have no idea what he spends the rest of his money on. I mean, I know he pays the bills and things, but if there's anything extra, it comes out of my pay. At the beginning of the school year, J.J.'s teacher sent a note home saying she thought he needed his eyes checked. Jeff threw a fit. You'd have thought I'd just asked him to cut an arm off. I ended up paying for his eye exam and new glasses. I buy all the new school clothes, I buy all the Christmas presents and birthday presents, I make the payments on my car. I need that money to survive on.", "input": "", "output": "If that is the case, I can certainly understand your reasoning. Do you think Jeff will give you any trouble over the money?"}, {"instruction": "No, because if he does...well, let's just say it wouldn't be in his best interest. I think once he realizes I hold all the cards and he begins to take me seriously, all will go smoothly.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you're right."}, {"instruction": "Me too. I'm just going to take things as they come, one day at a time.", "input": "", "output": "Speaking of time, ours is up for today. Can you come in next week at the same time?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, that'll be fine.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, that's Monday, December 2nd at 2 pm."}, {"instruction": "Thanks Dr. B. See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Hi Doctor B. How was your Thanksgiving?", "input": "", "output": "Very nice, thank you. How was yours?"}, {"instruction": "I lived through it, so I suppose that's the best I can hope for.", "input": "", "output": "What did your family do for Thanksgiving?"}, {"instruction": "We all went to Jeff's parents' house. I've always hated going to his folks' house for holidays. All his mother does is whine and complain, his sister is the bitch from hell, his brother is such a snob he won't talk to anyone else, and his grandmother sits in the rocking chair in the corner getting smashed on cranberry wine.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like an interesting bunch of people."}, {"instruction": "Yeah right. And lucky me, I get to spend Christmas there too!", "input": "", "output": "You said all of you went to Jeff's parents. Does that mean Robby went with you too?"}, {"instruction": "No, he went to his sister's house. I think she lives somewhere near Fresno. He left Wednesday evening and didn't get home until late last night. I'm curious to know if he told his family he has AIDS. I think he'll tell his sister and maybe his mother, but I know he won't tell the rest of the family. If he even hinted to his father he was gay, his dad would have a heart attack! I guess they'll find out soon enough. There was a guy in our church last year who contracted AIDS. It was really difficult on his family. They got two really big blows at once: their son is gay and he has AIDS. He only lived about 3 weeks after he told his family. The whole thing was really sad. I just hope Robby doesn't wait too long. I think he'll need his family toward the end.", "input": "", "output": "What about Jeff?"}, {"instruction": "What about him?", "input": "", "output": "Does his family know he and Robby are lovers?"}, {"instruction": "Hardly! Jeff's family is very unaccepting of anything not within a certain normal range of behavior. Being gay is not acceptable. And I don't really give a shit if Jeff tells his family. They'd find some way to blame it on me anyway, so I'd just assume they don't know. Besides, the fewer people that know, the better. I can't risk it getting back to the kids. They're just not ready for a load of information like that.", "input": "", "output": "Yes I understand. How are the kids getting along given the situation between you and your husband?"}, {"instruction": "Jeff is not my husband. He's the man I'm married to. That's it!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry. I know how strongly you feel about that."}, {"instruction": "There's really nothing different for them. They know we had a fight, Jeff moved out for awhile, but now's he's back and everything is fine.", "input": "", "output": "So you don't think the children will suffer because of the stress and strain between you and Jeff?"}, {"instruction": "No. I'm doing everything within my power to keep things as simple as possible. If I need to talk with Jeff, we do it privately. Jeff knows he's on thin ice with me anyway. He's not going to do anything to jeopardize the arrangements we've made.", "input": "", "output": "That statement brings to mind something you said in an earlier session, that while you were working for Robby at the office, you felt you were living two separate lives. Is that the way you feel now?"}, {"instruction": "No, not exactly. I feel as though I'm finally getting to the place I want to be...the me I want to be. I'm one person who is dealing with two separate issues. But no, I don't feel the need to be one person for Jeff and another person for Robby. I'm Sarah. This is how I am and both of them can rot in hell if they don't like it. I've come too far to ever let things go back to the way they were. There may have been big changes on the inside, but I'm telling you, nothing has changed on the outside.", "input": "", "output": "Nothing has changed except an old friend has moved into your home."}, {"instruction": "Actually the kids think it's cool having Robby live so close, especially Melissa. In fact, I've been a little worried about that. Melissa has always liked Robby a lot. And now that Robby knows she's his daughter, I think he's trying to get to know her better.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "On the one hand I feel elated about it. Melissa's father, the man I've been in love with since high school, is finally going to have a relationship with our daughter.  Though it won't be a conventional relationship, I think it's wonderful that Robby wants to have a relationship with her in the first place. He missed so much as she was growing up. But I really don't know how he feels about her, either. When I told him he was Melissa's father, he was kind of surprised, but then later said that he had a feeling all along. I guess I thought he would have made a greater effort by now to get to know his daughter.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Robby will tell Melissa he's her real father?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't think so. But I suppose I should talk to him about it. I don't want to limit their time together. I want Robby to know Melissa and for her to know him. Someday I'll tell her and I want her to have good memories of her real father. I'm just going to have to be extra careful when it comes to dealing with my daughter. But I don't want to talk about Robby anymore today, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Whatever you want Sarah. Why don't you tell me how you've been feeling physically?"}, {"instruction": "Headaches mostly. And I think that's from grinding my teeth in my sleep.", "input": "", "output": "How have your sleep patterns been lately?"}, {"instruction": "Better than a few months ago. But sometimes I still can't sleep for more than an hour or two at a time. I get a lot of work done, though!", "input": "", "output": "Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know if this is physical or not, but I'm lonely.", "input": "", "output": "Loneliness can be a physical or emotional symptom of what's going on in your life right now. Can you explain how you feel about being lonely?"}, {"instruction": "It feels like something is definitely missing in my life, but I can't explain what it is. It's like I have this need to be touched or held. I miss being close to someone. Even when Jeff and I had a physical relationship, it was better than nothing. Now there is nothing.", "input": "", "output": "Are you trying to say you feel sexually unfulfilled?"}, {"instruction": "Yes I suppose that's all it is. It will pass, I'm sure.", "input": "", "output": "Have you tried..."}, {"instruction": "Let's not go there, okay Doctor B? That's just a little too personal.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine Sarah. We don't have to discuss anything you're uncomfortable with."}, {"instruction": "It's not that I'm exactly uncomfortable talking about sex. It's just that something happened last week that really caught me off guard and made me think.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Can we talk about it next week? I'm kind of tired right now. I think I would like go home now.", "input": "", "output": "Sure. Can you come in next week at the same time?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes. I'll be here. See you then.", "input": "", "output": "Okay then.  Goodbye Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Not bad. How about you?", "input": "", "output": "I'm fine thanks. I was reading over my notes from our last session. You mentioned feeling lonely, and at the end of our session, you said something happened that had caught you off guard. Do you want to start by talking about that today?"}, {"instruction": "You know the more I thought about it, the sillier I felt. It was nothing, I'm sure.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps you're right, but last week you seemed quite affected by it."}, {"instruction": "Yes I was. I experienced something that left me feeling very guilty and a bit uncomfortable. My best friend Lisa--I've told you about her--well I had a brief encounter of sorts with her husband Glen. It was nothing really, but at the time I felt kind of strange about it.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to talk about what happened?"}, {"instruction": "I stopped by Lisa's house the day before Thanksgiving. Her husband works swing shift and he was home alone. I had forgotten Lisa had a doctor's appointment, but he invited me in and we had a really nice conversation. He asked me how things were going with Jeff and Robby and that whole mess. He and I have always been fairly close. I mean, he's my best friend's husband, but he's also my friend too. When he and Lisa were having some trouble in their marriage, I was the one Glen turned to for moral support. He can't stand Jeff either, but that's beside the point. So anyway, we're sitting at the kitchen table having coffee, nothing unusual, and all of a sudden I feel an anxiety attack coming on from out of nowhere. That's what's so frustrating sometimes; they catch me off guard.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do then?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't want Glen to get upset. He's been very touchy with me ever since I had the heart attack. I think it scared him as much as it did me! He must have noticed the look on my face because he says, \"Sarah, what's the matter?\" I reached for my purse right away to take an Xanax, and I started pacing the floor, hoping the anxiety wouldn't get out of hand. If it had gotten really bad, it would have been really embarassing to have him see me.", "input": "", "output": "So it wasn't a terribly bad anxiety attack?"}, {"instruction": "No, I've had much worse. Once I feel like I don't have to keep moving I always get extremely tired, so Glen had me lie on the sofa and he brought me some juice to drink. He was just making such a fuss over me--rubbing my arm, telling me it was okay, that sort of thing. Well I started to cry, as is the norm for me when I have an anxiety attack. He put his arms around me and started rocking back and forth. The movement seemed to calm me. It wasn't until a few hours later, after I got back home, that it occured to me the things he said while he was rocking me.", "input": "", "output": "What did he say?"}, {"instruction": "At first it was just calming things like, \"Shh it's okay.\" But then I remembered him saying, \"Poor sweet Sarah. She's too beautiful to cry. Who made sweet Sarah cry.\" Then later, when I had stopped crying, he kissed the tears from my cheeks. I knew then something had changed.", "input": "", "output": "What changed?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure what it was. I know that I was emotionally raw at the moment, but when he touched my cheek it felt good. It felt right. That's when I started feeling guilty and uncomfortable. I realized what time it was and told Glen I had to get home. He didn't want me to go, but as I put my coat on, he put his arms around me and whispered in my ear, \"If you ever need anything, I'm here for you.\" And that was all there was to it.", "input": "", "output": "Did you say anything to him?"}, {"instruction": "I just said, \"Thanks I appreciate that.\" Then I left. See? I told you it was silly. I'm sure he didn't mean anything by it at all. He was just trying to be caring and...", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure?"}, {"instruction": "Of course I'm sure. He's Lisa's husband. My god, we've be friends for years.... all right, I'm not so sure what he meant by what he said.", "input": "", "output": "Here, would you like a tissue?"}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I'm sorry, I don't mean to fall apart. It's just that this has been really agonizing for me.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps if you limit your time alone with him, this won't turn into a problem."}, {"instruction": "That's not what is bothering me.", "input": "", "output": "Then what is bothering you?"}, {"instruction": "I know this must sound awful, but I think I'd actually like to spend more time alone with him. I've been having dreams about him and I just can't seem to get him off my mind.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I can't believe I just said that! What is wrong with me? I don't have enough problems that now I'm attracted to my best friend's husband? I need to be locked up somewhere.", "input": "", "output": "Try to calm down Sarah. Let's look at this logically."}, {"instruction": "There is no logic to this.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps there is. You have been in a marriage that is less than satisfactory. You've been in love with a man with whom you can't have a physical relationship because he's gay, and now you find yourself physically attracted to a man you've been friends with for a long time."}, {"instruction": "So you think I'm transferring my feelings for Robby to someone else?", "input": "", "output": "Could be. Tell me a little about Glen."}, {"instruction": "Oh he's such a really nice man. I've always teased Lisa that if she ever dumped him, I wanted first dibs. He's a wonderful husband and a wonderful father. He helps Lisa around the house, gives her everything he can. He's loving and caring...now that I think about it, he's everything Jeff isn't.", "input": "", "output": "Let's stop there for a minute. You've been friends with Glen for quite a while. He has a lot of qualities that you'd like Jeff to have. And apparently you find him physically attractive, yes?"}, {"instruction": "Yes absolutely! Tall, sandy blonde hair, beautiful blue eyes. And his body...well, it belongs on the cover of Playgirl.", "input": "", "output": "Describe Robby to me, Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Robby? Well he's kind of tall. Thin  but muscular. He works out a lot. Blonde hair, blue eyes, nice tan.... Oh my god, why didn't I see this before?", "input": "", "output": "What Sarah?"}, {"instruction": "Robby, Jeff....Glen...oh, I can't believe this. I'm attracted to Glen because he reminds me of Robby and he's the opposite of Jeff!", "input": "", "output": "That's what it sounds like to me."}, {"instruction": "What the hell am I going to do? I certainly can't carry on a relationship with Glen. If Lisa found out, she'd kill us both! The best thing to do is just put him right out of my mind. I can't give this another thought!", "input": "", "output": "Sarah I'm afraid it may not be that easy."}, {"instruction": "Yes, yes it will. I'll just forget the whole thing. This is nothing, honestly. Even if I wanted to--and I don't--I would never do anything to hurt Lisa.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you wouldn't intentionally hurt anyone, but if you continue feeling this way about Glen, you may have bigger problems down the road."}, {"instruction": "You said yourself I'm probably just transferring my unfulfilled desires from one man to another. It will pass. I love Robby. I'll always love him. Nothing will change that. I just need to put my mind on other things, like making Jeff's life miserable.", "input": "", "output": "How are things with you and Jeff?"}, {"instruction": "Fine I suppose. We try to avoid each other as much as possible. He had to fly down to San Diego last Friday morning, just for a quick meeting, and he decided he wanted to take Robby with him  and they would just stay for the whole weekend. I told him no way was he taking his gay lover anywhere! I threatened to call his mother and tell her what her baby boy has been up to if he went anywhere with Robby.", "input": "", "output": "And Jeff agreed not to take Robby?"}, {"instruction": "Of course he agreed. He's not a total fool.", "input": "", "output": "Would you really have told his mother?"}, {"instruction": "No, but if that's what works, I'll use anything I can against him.", "input": "", "output": "Why didn't you want him to take Robby to San Diego with him?"}, {"instruction": "Because....I'm jealous I suppose. If I can't be with Robby, I certainly don't want Jeff to be with him either.", "input": "", "output": "But don't you want Robby to be happy?"}, {"instruction": "Robby is happy. A trip to San Diego wouldn't make him any happier and it would only leave me feeling depressed, so why allow it?", "input": "", "output": "Sarah, you still haven't accepted the relationship between Jeff and Robby have you?"}, {"instruction": "I think I've done pretty damn well accepting it. Let's be real...I've let the two of them move into my home, what else can I do?", "input": "", "output": "I still feel a lot of anger from you."}, {"instruction": "Maybe so, but I'm dealing with things the best I can right now.", "input": "", "output": "Well we're out of time for today, but I'd like to see you next week at the 2 pm. Is that okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure that's fine. I'll see you next Monday. Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Hi Dr. B. I'm pretty good. How about you?", "input": "", "output": "I'm well, thank you. Only nine shopping days until Christmas--are you finished with everything?"}, {"instruction": "No, actually I've hardly begun.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? So I couldn't talk you into doing my shopping for me?"}, {"instruction": "Ha Ha, Dr. B. I wish someone would do my shopping too. I just can't seem to get into Christmas this year.", "input": "", "output": "Well that's not surprising considering what you've been through, Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Yes I suppose so, but Christmas has always been my favorite time of the year. When I was little, my parents would always take us to our grandparents house for Christmas. They lived in Illinois, just north of Chicago. They lived in this beautiful Colonial house and Grandmother always had a Christmas tree in every room! Even the bathrooms had tiny decorated trees! But the entryway was alway my favorite. As we'd pull into the driveway, Granddaddy would be waiting for us, wearing that silly hat with the flaps over the ears. All of us girls would jump out of the car to hug Granddaddy, but my eyes were always on the door. I knew what I'd see even before we went inside. The entry was like a room in itself. Black and white tiled floor and a beautiful crystal chandelier hanging from the 20 foot ceiling, and the staircase in the middle that went up and then split into two other staircases, one to the right, one to the left. But the tree in that room was always where all the gifts were. It was huge! Floor to ceiling and every year Granddaddy would cut the tree down by himself. Even when he was too old to do it, he'd insist. When I was older, standing in front of that tree made me feel like a little girl. Safe and warm...and loved. Grandmother would come out of the kitchen wearing an apron with flour all over her face and hands and we'd jump into her arms for hugs and kisses, and she'd always say the same thing, \"I ordered this beautiful snow just for you girls!\" And we'd say, \"Oh Grandmother, God makes the snow not you!\" and she'd say, \"Yes, but I asked God to send the snow for my little snow angels!\"", "input": "", "output": "It sounds as though you have very fond memories of Christmas as a child."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes!", "input": "", "output": "Do your grandparents still live in Illinois?"}, {"instruction": "No, they're both dead now.", "input": "", "output": "Oh I'm sorry."}, {"instruction": "That's okay. Granddaddy died in the summer I turned 17, and Grandmother went just about 3 months later. They had been married over 60 years. They were so much in love that when Granddaddy died, I think Grandmother died of a broken heart. My parents are alot like that.", "input": "", "output": "Were these your mother's parents or your father's?"}, {"instruction": "My mother's. I never knew my father's parents. They both died before I was born. When Grandmother died, I felt so sorry for my mother. They were so close. But then Melissa was born not too long after that and my mother believes she is my Grandmother reincarnated.", "input": "", "output": "Really? What do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I think Mother is probably right. When Melissa is old enough to understand, I'm sure Mother will want her to go through past life regression therapy to verify it.", "input": "", "output": "Your family has some very unique beliefs."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I suppose some would think it strange, but to us it is just normal. We always believed that death was just another beginning and that the people we loved in one life we would find in our next life also. The roles may have changed but the soul is still there and that is the part that we recognize in each other.", "input": "", "output": "And this is the same belief system you've based your relationship with Robby on, is that correct?"}, {"instruction": "Yes for the most part. We are bonded to each other from some age long past, and we will be together again in some age to come. Even my mother recognized Robby's soul the first time she met him. We've all been together before.", "input": "", "output": "I see and do you..."}, {"instruction": "I'd rather not reminisce anymore, Dr. B.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine Sarah. Is there something else you'd like to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "No, just not that. There's just no way you're ever going to understand.", "input": "", "output": "You're probably right Sarah, but I still find it somewhat fascinating."}, {"instruction": "Yeah well...let's change the subject. I've only got another 2 weeks of work left. I'll be glad when I'm finished. At first I was unsure about quitting my job, but the closer it gets to my last day the better I feel.", "input": "", "output": "Have they found a replacement for you yet?"}, {"instruction": "No but they'd better find one soon, or I'm not going to have time to train someone. I actually wanted a month to train the new person, but I guess that's not going to happen.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think they're stalling in hopes you'll decide to stay?"}, {"instruction": "No! That would be a Robby thing to do. No, I just think they're having trouble finding someone with enough experince to handle the position.", "input": "", "output": "So you are looking forward to having some free time to yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, at least for awhile. Until Robby needs my attention more and more. With the money Jeff is giving me every week, which is all going into a separate account in my name only, I shouldn't have to worry too much about finances.", "input": "", "output": "Jeff still isn't giving you any grief about the money?"}, {"instruction": "No, he knows better. Actually, I've put the account in mine and my mother's name, that way if anything happens to me, my mother will get the money instead of Jeff.", "input": "", "output": "What do you intend to use that money for?"}, {"instruction": "Whatever I want. All the things I've wanted to do and places I've wanted to see that Jeff would never allow. I want to go to New Orleans during Mardi Gras. I want to take my mother on a Carribbean cruise. She wants to try scuba diving. There's a ton of things I want to do!", "input": "", "output": "Basically you're going to make up for all the things you feel Jeff has denied you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes but I realize I was denying those things to me also. It wasn't all Jeff's fault. If I'd stuck up for myself when I should've, I probably wouldn't be in the mess I'm in now. I let Jeff, and Robby as far as that goes, treat me the way they did. That was my fault. But as you know, things are not that way any more.", "input": "", "output": "Yes Sarah, I've seen some major changes in your attitude since we've begun our sessions together."}, {"instruction": "Well, I have to say you've helped me realize so much. I don't know if I could've gotten this far without your help and support, Dr. B.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you Sarah, I'm glad that you feel I've been able to help you through some difficult times. We have a few minutes left, do you mind if I ask you about Glen?"}, {"instruction": "He called me last week from work. I'm glad Jeff didn't answer the phone.", "input": "", "output": "What did you say?"}, {"instruction": "Basically he just wanted to make sure I was okay, but then he asked if we could get together for lunch sometime the week after Christmas. Lisa's parents are coming for 2 weeks and Lisa will be occupied with them, so neither of us will be missed for a few hours.", "input": "", "output": "Did you agree to meet him for lunch?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I told him I had to check my calendar and see what days I had free.", "input": "", "output": "But do you intend to meet him clandestinely?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I think I will.", "input": "", "output": "Have you given this sufficient thought?"}, {"instruction": "No I'm sure I haven't, but just having lunch with the man doesn't mean we'll end up in bed together.", "input": "", "output": "You're right, it doesn't have to result in a physical relationship. I would just like to suggest..."}, {"instruction": "Oh look, our time is up for today...don't want to make you late for your next appointment!", "input": "", "output": "Okay Sarah, I can take a hint. Can you come in next week at the same time?"}, {"instruction": "Well, if it's okay with you, I'd like to skip next week. I'm going to have so much to do just before Christmas. How about the week after?", "input": "", "output": "Let's see.  That'll be Monday, December 30th at 2:00pm? That should be fine."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. Have a Merry Christmas Dr. B.!", "input": "", "output": "Thank you Sarah. Merry Christmas to you too. See you on the 30th."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Fine thanks. And yours?", "input": "", "output": "Very nice, thank you. Do you have plans for New Year's Eve?"}, {"instruction": "Yes and no. We've been invited to several parties, but I'm not really in the partying mood. My friend Lisa and her husband are going to Las Vegas for New Year's Eve! Now that might be fun!", "input": "", "output": "Speaking of Lisa and her husband, last time we talked you said you had agreed to meet Glen for lunch. Did that meeting take place?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, we had lunch.  Then we went across the street to a sleazy motel and had an afternoon of incredible sex!", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I certainly didn't plan it. It just happened, you know? It really was great though!", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to talk about this?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure there's much to talk about. We had lunch, we talked, we had sex. Then we had sex again. And then once more!", "input": "", "output": "But you were extremely concerned about not hurting your friend Lisa. Has that changed? Do you not care anymore?"}, {"instruction": "No, of course that hasn't changed.  Okay, here's the deal. Lisa knew about it.", "input": "", "output": "I'm afraid I don't understand."}, {"instruction": "It seems my friend has a fetish that she's never told me about. She likes to hear about the women that her husband fucks. She likes to hear all the details, then it turns her on so much they have wild sex. I'm told that she sometimes likes to watch too.", "input": "", "output": "So how did you come about this information?"}, {"instruction": "Christmas Eve we all got together: Lisa and Glen and Jeff, Robby and I. I felt a little awkward at first. The man I'm married to, the man I love, and the man I've agreed to meet for lunch, all in one room. We had a few drinks, everyone was in a good mood, and Lisa pulled me out on to the patio to talk. When Lisa starts drinking she can get really mouthy, so when she told me that Glen had told her we were meeting for lunch on Friday, I was sure exactly why she was telling me. My first thought was \"Oh shit!\" I said, \"Lisa, I'm sorry....\", but then she cut me off and put her arms around me and started laughing. Naturally by this point I'm totally confused.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I can understand."}, {"instruction": "She just started giggling and telling me, \"Shhh, be quiet. I don't want Glen to know that I told you I know.\"", "input": "", "output": "Now I'm really confused."}, {"instruction": "Yeah so was I, but then she started telling me how \"The Game\" usually works. Usually, it's someone Lisa doesn't know.  Seems if there's a women Glen is attracted to--say someone he works with--they get together a few times for some great sex, Glen tells Lisa all the details, the woman doesn't feel bad about hurting anyone...everyone's happy!", "input": "", "output": "So why did Lisa decide to tell you about The Game?"}, {"instruction": "That's exactly what I asked her! She said she knew how I would feel if Glen and I had sex. The remorse, guilt, et cetera, et cetera. She wanted me to know it was okay with her and she wanted me to have a good time without feeling bad about it.", "input": "", "output": "She seems to be quite open-minded."}, {"instruction": "Yes, she's always been that way. I just never realized to what extent.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, so Lisa basically grants permission for you and her husband to have an affair. What happened after that?"}, {"instruction": "First of all, it wasn't an affair. To me, an affair is something that's done behind someone's back....there's potential for hurt in an affair. What Glen and I did was two friends spending some quality time together. No one gets hurt, and everyone gains some sort of benefit from The Game.", "input": "", "output": "All right, in your mind it's not an affair. You and Glen spend the afternoon together in a cheap motel..."}, {"instruction": "Sleazy. There's a difference.", "input": "", "output": "Excuse me. You and Glen spend the afternoon together in a sleazy motel and Glen didn't know you had already talked to Lisa about it, is that correct?"}, {"instruction": "Right. Part of what turns Glen on is the seduction, so I let him seduce me. Actually, it was the best part of The Game. He's really good at what he does. I was about ready to go off before he even had my clothes off!", "input": "", "output": "So you pretend not to know about The Game, and Glen seduces you and you end up having sex three times that afternoon?"}, {"instruction": "Yes and one time the next day.", "input": "", "output": "The next day? Was that part of The Game also?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. We did it in their garage, on his workbench.", "input": "", "output": "Did Lisa know about that time?"}, {"instruction": "Not ahead of time, but he told her soon after.", "input": "", "output": "And she was still okay with that?"}, {"instruction": "Oh definitely! But I still have to pretend that I don't know about The Game. If Glen knew I was playing a role in it, he wouldn't enjoy it as much. As I said, he gets off on the seduction part. It would be hard to seduce someone who was willing to....well you know.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I'm beginning to see the picture. So earlier, when you said it wasn't planned, that it just happened, you weren't really being honest?"}, {"instruction": "No I wasn't. I wasn't sure if I should tell you, but then I figured what the hell. I've told you everything else about my twisted life.", "input": "", "output": "Sarah, I can certainly understand if there are things you'd rather not discuss with me, but being honest when we do discuss things will always produce the best results from our sessions."}, {"instruction": "Yes I know that. I just wasn't sure what your reaction would be, but like I said, you've never judged me on anything before so I decided to come clean.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not here to judge you, Sarah. I just want to help you understand the feelings and emotions that you have and help you make the right decisions for yourself."}, {"instruction": "And I appreciate that more than you know.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. So tell me, have you talked with Lisa about the events that have occurred between you and Glen?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, we've talked at length. She is one wild woman! Glen came home and told her all about how he seduced me, and that he almost had me talked into having sex in the car, but I insisted on the sleazy motel across the street. We both laughed because she knows how I've been feeling lately...sexually frustrated and all. Hell, it was all I could do to keep from saying, \"Glen, do me right here right now!\" Anyway Lisa told me that Glen really enjoyed himself and she wondered if I enjoyed myself too. I told her that I definitely had a good time. Then she asked me if I'd ever had anyone who was so big.", "input": "", "output": "Big?  I thought you said he was muscular but slight of build."}, {"instruction": "Come on, Dr. B.  Big, you know? His penis?", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry if I embarrass you.", "input": "", "output": "No no, that's fine. Please continue."}, {"instruction": "Well, I was quite impressed with his playing piece.  My god, I think he's probably as big around as a soup can! Anyway, it was all good and wonderful and fun, and I'm going to do it again as soon as possible!", "input": "", "output": "It does sound as though you have found a relief valve, but are you sure this is safe?"}, {"instruction": "Well, if you mean \"safe\" as in safe sex, we used a condom every time.", "input": "", "output": "Yes that, but also safe as in emotionally safe? I'm concerned that down the line you may begin to regret playing The Game with Lisa and her husband."}, {"instruction": "Dr. B., right now the game has put something back into my life that's been missing for a long time. I feel fulfilled and...filled!", "input": "", "output": "But what about emotionally? Are you filled emotionally, Sarah?"}, {"instruction": "No, I suppose not. But being physically fulfilled can replace emotional needs, at least for awhile anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but I just hope you don't start getting the two confused and...."}, {"instruction": "Oh would you look at the time! I've got to get going. Can we set something up for same time next week?", "input": "", "output": "Yes that's fine. Next Monday, January 6th at 2:00 pm."}, {"instruction": "That'll be great. Thanks Dr. B. See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Hi Doc. It's good to be seen. I'm sorry about canceling our appointment last week.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay. Was there anything wrong?"}, {"instruction": "Five people, the flu, one bathroom.", "input": "", "output": "I see. I hope everyone is better now."}, {"instruction": "Most everyone. Melissa is still home sick. School started last week. She went two days and has been in bed since.", "input": "", "output": "Have you taken her to the doctor?"}, {"instruction": "I called the doctor's office and they told me it sounded like what everyone else had. They called in a prescription for her, so hopefully she'll be back on her feet soon.", "input": "", "output": "And what about you? How are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "Other than still being kind of weak and run down, I'm doing okay I guess. I think I'm about to go through one of my down periods, though. Not something to look forward to.", "input": "", "output": "How long has it been since your last down period, Sarah?"}, {"instruction": "Two maybe three months. It's hard to remember sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "When you have these episodes, do you find that the Xanax helps?"}, {"instruction": "Not much. Maybe a little. It's just so difficult to tell. I wish I could be more specific.", "input": "", "output": "I would like to try an anti-depressant with you Sarah, if you're agreeable."}, {"instruction": "You think I'm depressed? No, I don't think so Doc. Depression is for people who live in sanitariums with padded walls.", "input": "", "output": "Sarah, you're stereotyping. Being depressed doesn't mean that you're insane."}, {"instruction": "Then what does it mean?", "input": "", "output": "In your case, I suspect it's a chemical depression. Think of the spark plugs in a car. If they're all gummed up, they don't spark as they should. You can think of your brain working in a similar way. Your brain needs certain chemicals, they're called neuro transmitters, to help it regulate emotions, including anxiety and contentment.  If the levels are low, those sparks don't fire properly in your brain. That, in turn, causes many of the symptoms that you've talked about before."}, {"instruction": "Which symptoms?", "input": "", "output": "Well, without looking at your entire transcript, I'd say..."}, {"instruction": "Being afraid in crowds? Noise levels seeming very high? Sitting on the floor crying? Not being able to complete a sentence? Are these the symptoms you're talking about??", "input": "", "output": "Yes, exactly.  Zoloft has shown to be a great help in treating patients with those types of symptoms.  I had a talk with your cardiologist and he doesn't seem to think that it presents a problem."}, {"instruction": "Well....I'm not crazy about having to take more pills, but if you think it may work, I'll give it a try.", "input": "", "output": "Good. It may take a few weeks, but I think you'll see a great improvement in your emotional well-being."}, {"instruction": "That would be wonderful, but I'm not going to hold my breath.", "input": "", "output": "Let's just give it a try. If it doesn't work, no harm done, right?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, you're the doctor. Let's talk about something else, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Sure. What would you like to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "I told you that I gave my resignation at work. My last day was supposed to be December 31st.", "input": "", "output": "Supposed to be? You mean you're still working?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. They haven't found anyone to replace me yet, and I don't feel right about just walking out. They've had several ads in the paper but no one seems to fit the qualifications. I told them I'd stay until the end of the month, after that they're on their own. I suppose they'll have to go to temp service.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still comfortable with your decision to quit your job?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes. In fact, I'm looking forward to it. I'm hoping that once I'm home all day, Robby and I can...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Talk. Restore part of our relationship before he goes. I still have so many unresolved feelings towards him. Love, hate, anger. I'd hate for him to die without being able to work some of that out.", "input": "", "output": "How is Robby's health these days?"}, {"instruction": "He still has mostly good days, but the bad ones really put him down. I try not to think too much about the reason behind it, you know? I try not to think AIDS everytime he coughs or sneezes. I've noticed though that he's starting to lose weight. He's already slim. I imagine by the end, there won't be anything left but skin and bones.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, depending on quickly the disease progresses. As your psychiatrist, my primary concern is about you and how well you will be able to handle his death and dying."}, {"instruction": "I try not to think about it. I mean, I'm not putting blinders on--I know he's dying, but I've accepted that. It just makes me sad.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it is a very sad situation. How is Robby's and Jeff's relationship these days?"}, {"instruction": "Well, sometimes I think Jeff makes up excuses not to spend time with Robby.", "input": "", "output": "Really? I would like Jeff would want to spend as much time as possible with his dying lover."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, you'd think so wouldn't you? I haven't figured it out yet, but I have a feeling now that Robby is safely tucked away and being taken care of, Jeff's feelings for Robby have waned somewhat.", "input": "", "output": "You suspect Jeff isn't in love with Robby any longer?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know about that. There's something odd there, I just can't put my finger on what it is. When Robby first moved in, Jeff spent nearly every minute he was home with Robby in his apartment. He wanted to take Robby with him on business trips, that sort of thing. Now Jeff hardly sees Robby. He'll call him, ask if he needs anything, they'll chat for a while, but that's it.", "input": "", "output": "It does sound strange, considering Jeff begged you to let him move in."}, {"instruction": "Yes, well time will tell, I suppose.", "input": "", "output": "You're probably right. Do you mind talking about Glen today?"}, {"instruction": "Glen? Sure, what do you want to know?", "input": "", "output": "Have you played The Game with him recently?"}, {"instruction": "No, we haven't had a chance. He was working the day shift last week, then I got sick, so we haven't spoken in a while. Lisa said that he's anxious to get together again, though. I think she's more anxious than he is! It still just blows me away to think that Lisa gets off by hearing about Glen having sex with other women. All this time I've known her, she's never mentioned a word about it!", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes you can know a person your whole life and still never know everything about that person. Most people have a certain mask they wear for others. Perhaps Lisa thought you would think less of her if she told you about her fetish."}, {"instruction": "Yes, we talked a little about that. She said she didn't want me to lose respect for her. I said, \"Shit, Lisa, if you knew about some of my fantasies, yours would seem tame!\"", "input": "", "output": "So you still believe you can continue The Game with Glen and Lisa and not become emotionally involved?"}, {"instruction": "No problem. I mean Glen's a wonderful guy, but he's not...everything. I'm sure the novelty will fade, and both of us will laugh about it when it's over. No one gets hurt. That's the best part.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you're right. Looks like our time is up for today. I'm going to discontinue the Ativan and I'm going to write you a prescription for the Zoloft. Try it for a few weeks and see how you feel. If you have any problems, just give me a call."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I'll give it a try. Can we meet the same time next week?", "input": "", "output": "That'll be fine.  Let's see, that's Monday, January 20th."}, {"instruction": "Great. I'll see you next week. Goodbye Doc. B.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sarah."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor. How are you?", "input": "", "output": "Very well thanks. How are you feeling?"}, {"instruction": "Still kind of down.", "input": "", "output": "Are you taking the Zoloft I prescribed?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, every morning.", "input": "", "output": "It may take a few weeks for you to feel any difference, but stick with it; I think you'll notice a great improvement."}, {"instruction": "I will. The waiting gets me down. Everything gets me down. Some days it's all I can do to get myself out of bed and dressed. Other days I feel fine.", "input": "", "output": "Have they found a replacement for you at work yet?"}, {"instruction": "No, but they've interviewed several people so I think it will be soon.", "input": "", "output": "And are you still anxious to be finished with your job?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, even more so after last week.", "input": "", "output": "Did something happen?"}, {"instruction": "No, it's just the regular stuff. I'm still working on a lot of end of the year shit...balancing all our accounts, that sort of thing. It's a pain in the ass any time, but right now it seems especially draining. Everyone at work keeps telling me how tired I look.", "input": "", "output": "Being tired often comes with depression, Sarah."}, {"instruction": "I know, but knowing doesn't help. Sometimes I feel like I'm wading in wet cement. Every motion, every thought takes so much energy.", "input": "", "output": "I understand what you're going through, but trust me, it will get better."}, {"instruction": "I know.", "input": "", "output": "How are your kids? Is everyone over the flu?"}, {"instruction": "Everyone is well. Knock on wood! They're off from school today. Martin Luther King Day. Saturday was Jeff's birthday. The kids made him a cake and we went shopping Saturday morning for gifts. Robby came down and had dinner with us that night. Jeff seemed uncomfortable with them there, but after dinner they left together. Robby told me yesterday that Jeff took him to the coffee shop they used to meet at. Apparently I'm not the only one who has noticed a change in Jeff's attitude toward Robby.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? Did Robby say something to you about it?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, he told me that when they were at the coffee shop he came right out and asked Jeff if he was seeing someone else.", "input": "", "output": "And is he?"}, {"instruction": "He told Robby he isn't, but I have to wonder.", "input": "", "output": "Did Robby believe him?"}, {"instruction": "He wants to believe him, but I think he's starting to give up, too. He knows that he and Jeff will never have the relationship they once had, and he doesn't want Jeff tied to him, but it pains him to think Jeff is seeing someone else.", "input": "", "output": "And how does that make you feel, Sarah?"}, {"instruction": "Like I care. I don't give a shit what the man does. I don't want him to hurt Robby, but the way I see it, if he's screwing around with someone else...well, never mind.", "input": "", "output": "What? What were you going to say?"}, {"instruction": "If Jeff fools around and gets AIDS too, well....no big loss.", "input": "", "output": "Sarah, you don't really mean that, do you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes I do. Well, it would hurt the children, and I wouldn't want them to suffer, but other than that, I'd rather he was dying of AIDS instead of Robby.", "input": "", "output": "Life is never dished out according to our grievances."}, {"instruction": "Ain't that the truth! I want so much to be with Robby, to comfort and protect him, put my arms around him, make things better for him. He hasn't always deserved my love and sympathy, but he has it regardless.", "input": "", "output": "I hope that you and Robby will be able to talk and work out some of the emotions you both have before it's too late."}, {"instruction": "Me too. Sometimes I lay awake at night and think about all the things I want to tell him and ask him. I don't know how much time we have left, but I want to make the most of it, for both of us. Last night when we talked, and he told me about Jeff taking him to the coffee shop, I felt really close to him, yet I didn't have the nerve to bring up anything I wanted to tell him. He was hurting so much as it was because he feels Jeff slipping away. I just wanted to be there for him. A friend. A shoulder to cry on. My turn will come, I know it will. All my questions will be answered. I'm just not very patient. I'm very tired, Dr. B. Would you mind if we cut our session short today?", "input": "", "output": "No Sarah, that's fine. Can we meet again next week?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. Can I call you later this week and set something up?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, if that's what you want. I'll wait to hear from you."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I'll call in a few days. Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sarah. Take care of yourself."}]
