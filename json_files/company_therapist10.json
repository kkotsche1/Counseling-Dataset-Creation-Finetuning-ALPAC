[{"instruction": "Hi there, Doctor. Please, call me Olivia. I'm a rather informal person.", "input": "", "output": "I'm pleased to meet you, Olivia. So how may I help you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's really my father that you'll be helping. He's so over-protective. He seems to think there must be some deep-seated emotional trauma for me to deal with.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I haven't been sleeping too well lately, and even though I live on my own, Daddy still worries--Daddy's little girl and all that. But, I have been feeling a bit stressed, I suppose. When Daddy suggested I see you, I just knew you'd be the answer I needed.", "input": "", "output": "Answer?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I need you to do some psychoanalyzing of someone. A stalker.", "input": "", "output": "A stalker. Not you, I hope."}, {"instruction": "Yes, me! No. I mean...I'm not the stalker. I'm the stalkee, or whatever you call it. I'm being stalked.", "input": "", "output": "Have you contacted..."}, {"instruction": "The cops? No. They can't do anything until a crime has been committed. I just want to get into this guy's head and figure out how to shake him.", "input": "", "output": "Please start at the beginning and explain to me your relationship with this man."}, {"instruction": "Well, we began talking a few months ago. Let's see...it was July or August, I believe. Sometime around there. He said he's thirty two, but I've since learned that he's actually forty five. And he's married. We just talked about stuff in general for a while. Then, out the blue, he said that he loves me and wants to marry me! I was totally shocked! We were just friends, you know? And here he is talking about the big \"forever.\" Okay, so I told him that I thought he was a great guy and all, but I was just not interested. I have my whole life in front of me, and I'm just getting started and all. Well, that's when he got a bit creepy.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, please go on."}, {"instruction": "For a week or two, it was like he was in denial or something. He didn't believe me, I guess. I wasn't rude or mean or anything, but I must have told him a zillion ways that there was no chance of us being together. Then, he just disappeared. Poof, gone. Not a peep out of him. I started getting worried. Then, I started getting weird messages from him. He...uh, said that he loved me more than life and that he was trying very hard to accept my refusal of his love. He told me that he was very, very sad--depressed, in fact--and that he hadn't slept for three days. He also had hardly eaten anything and sat in his room with the windows closed. And...", "input": "", "output": "Take a moment to breathe, Olivia. Close your eyes and concentrate on breathing a bit."}, {"instruction": "I'm okay now. It's just...it still freaks me out, you know?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Olivia, let's stop here for a moment. If you're really in danger, you need to alert the authorities. Before you protest, I must stress to you that alerting the authorities could possibly save your life. Even if he hasn't committed a crime yet, you can still get a restraining order against him so that if he ever does come near you, he's breaking the law.  Do you think he's likely to do something criminal?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he said he tried to kill himself. He drank a lot of vodka, swallowed a lot of Benadryl, smoked some pot, and then tried to hang himself.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Well, he didn't secure the rope or something and fell to the floor and hit his head. Then, he just slept it all off. You know I thought he was a decent guy. He seemed kind of stable. But now...jeez! He's like a freak! He's been trying to make me feel guilty, trying to guilt me into being with him. Forget that! I'm not stupid. But he's scaring me. He's...um, mentioned to some of my friends that he plans to show up at my work and beg me to go away with him. I've been getting a lot of hang-up phone calls lately, too. This is constantly on my mind, and I guess it's been stressing me out a bit. Like I said, I haven't been sleeping too well lately.", "input": "", "output": "It can be very frightening when someone tries to intimidate you into loving them. Do you think that his threats of suicide are emotional blackmail or are they serious?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I hadn't given them that word, but yes. And then threats to show up at my work...sheesh! My dad would freak! I've been working at Stillwell Enterprises for a couple years now, and I'm finally at the point where I've proven to everyone there that I don't have my job because my dad owns the company. Daddy has always considered me his china doll, and the possible repercussion of all of this would send him ballistic!", "input": "", "output": "What repercussion?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the scandal of being involved with a married man, for example, even though I'm not involved with him. And the scare Daddy will get when he finds out I'm being stalked. The gossip at work. Once the initial shock wears off for him, he'll be \"disappointed in my judgment\" and all that stuff. He really does think I'm incapable of making good decisions.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Let's set this matter aside for a moment, Olivia. You've mentioned some anxieties, you said you haven't been sleeping. Tell me a little about that."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm just really restless. I feel tired. My body gets tired, but my mind isn't sleepy. That sounds kind of weird, but it's the best way I can describe it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Besides for dealing with your stalker, the first thing you and I will do is try to get you to sleep to get some rest. This will relieve some stress on your body and allow you to relax more, which in turn will allow you to deal better with your stalker problem."}, {"instruction": "Well, I could definitely use the rest. I'd appreciate your help with that, yes. But other than that, I just want to figure out how to get this guy out of my life. But as for other possible therapy issues...I know my feelings. I haven't been abused. I'm not psycho. I just want to get this guy to leave me alone.", "input": "", "output": "All right. How often during the day do you think about this problem, Olivia?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? Um...often. A lot. Okay, almost all the time.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  From what you told me so far, I don't have a real feel for whether this man is dangerous or not.  I suggest that you go to the police and get a restraining order against this man. Get that little device that the phone companies have to identify the caller's number--caller i.d.  If you suspect that the hang-up calls that you're getting are form him, you could tell the police about them and they will trace the number and try to deal with it.  But you have to get the restraining order."}, {"instruction": "Restraining order?  Won't that get him in trouble?", "input": "", "output": "It's not like an arrest record.  But remember, he shouldn't be bothering you either."}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Next, I would like you to pick up some Melatonin in the pharmacy downstairs on your way out. Melatonin is the agent in warm milk that makes you sleepy. It's not addictive and it might help you sleep."}, {"instruction": "I can do that. Oh, my father said he would send you the billing information. Did he?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. I'll send the bills to him. This does not mean that I share any information with him, Olivia. He is only going to be paying the bills. I want you to understand that what you and I discuss here will remain strictly between us unless you give specific permission to do otherwise."}, {"instruction": "I was pretty sure about the confidentiality stuff, but it's nice to hear you say it.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't we go ahead and schedule our next session?"}, {"instruction": "I would like that.  But next week is Christmas, and then there's New Year's Eve...", "input": "", "output": "Let's schedule a session on the first Monday of 1998.  That's January 5th.  Does this time work for you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, it's fine.  Since my dad insisted on therapy, I'm free to take time off during the week to see you.  Four in the afternoon is just fine.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  In the meantime, if something comes up and you want to talk to me, you can call my number and my answering service will contact me."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure I won't need to do that, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "It's just in case.  Okay, Olivia.  It was very nice to meet you.  Have a Merry Christmas.  And I'll see in the new year."}, {"instruction": "Hi there. Yeah, no more circles under my eyes. Well, they're almost all gone, anyway. That Melatonin has been knocking me out night after night. It must be making me sleep really deep, too. I've been dreaming a lot more lately, more than probably ever before in my life!", "input": "", "output": "Good dreams or bad dreams?"}, {"instruction": "I knew you'd ask that! Actually, I can't remember the dreams, I just remember that I had them. I usually wake up with a good feeling, though. If they were bad dreams, I think I'd be able to feel it when I woke up.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad the Melatonin is helping. Have you tried sleeping without using the Melatonin?"}, {"instruction": "I did last night. It took me a while longer to fall asleep, but I was able to do it and I wasn't up all night. I'm going to keep trying to sleep on my own, but I'll use the Melatonin if I need it. Thanks for telling me about it; it's been great for me.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I'm glad it worked for you. Have you given any more thought to getting a restraining order?"}, {"instruction": "I have. But I just don't know how to go about doing something like that in Denmark.", "input": "", "output": "Excuse me? Denmark?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, okay. Don't look at me like that. I know, I know--I should have mentioned that to begin with but...well, everyone gives me these weird looks when I mention how much of a computer geek I really am. You know, Doc, if your eyebrows go up much further, you'll never have to worry about a receding hairline.", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, one thing you should understand is that this is the one place where you won't be judged. I'm not here to decide how you should live your life. I'm here to help you do well with your life and deal with the issues that you face. I am on your side as your advocate to help you understand the various facets of your life. Now to get back to what you were saying: what are you talking about?"}, {"instruction": "No one really seems to think that online stalking is real. My friends think I should just ignore it. But it's scary and really creepy. Jonas has learned quite a bit about me that I never told him. And the things I have told him, he's used to learn even more. I'm scared of this guy.", "input": "", "output": "The tissues are on the table."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor. Look at me--I'm trembling. You know, nothing has ever bugged me like this. But this guy...he just makes me shudder.", "input": "", "output": "What things have you told him about yourself that he is using against you now, Olivia?"}, {"instruction": "I met Jonas online, and we started chatting. We had some similar interests. It seemed that he found me to be completely intriguing. To him everything I said was witty, intelligent, wise, blah, blah, blah. Now that I look back, I can see he was just buttering me up. I'm normally very cautious when I'm online--you never know who is on the other end. I never give out personal info. If he had hounded me for info, I would have clammed up and shut him out. But he didn't. He mentioned once or twice how nice it would be to hear my voice. After I felt like I knew him pretty well and didn't consider him a psycho--boy, was I wrong--I told him he could call me. Since I didn't want him to be able to find out where I live, I gave him my work number. I know I could have called him, but I figured that he could foot the bill a few times first. Just before he started getting all mushy on me, he called and got my voice mail. My message gives my name and the company name. He put two and two together and came up with Daddy-dearest. He asked me about it and was amused at how Daddy's little girl was trying to be so fiercely independent--as he put it--while working for Daddy.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. So not only does he have your work phone number, but he knows where you work, and he knows that your father owns the company you work for. Do you think he might try to extort money from your father?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so. I don't have skeletons in my closet...well, besides this one. And this isn't even a big skeleton. It's just something I'd rather not broadcast.", "input": "", "output": "What is it that he feels he can gain by hounding you?"}, {"instruction": "Me. I guess he thinks I'll see the error of my ways, realize what a wonderful man he is, and go flying into his arms. No need to worry about that, Doc, I can see him for what he really is.", "input": "", "output": "And that is?"}, {"instruction": "He's selfish, insecure, and immature. He's also evil and conniving. He told a friend of mine--an online friend--that he got on a plane and flew all the way to New York before he realized that I would probably have his butt hauled to jail if he came near me. She said he was very depressed and that all he wanted was to be near me. He told her that he didn't care if I didn't love him back, that just being part of my life would be enough for him. On top of everything, he told me that he's married. To be honest, I don't know what to believe. The only thing I've been able to verify about him is that he lives in Denmark and works for a University. He is a professor. I checked with the phone operator to verify the country of the phone number he gave me, and she said that it was Denmark. Then, I checked the Internet to see if the university has an online presence. It does, and it even has a directory of all of their professors. I was able to verify that he does work at the University of Denmark and that he does work in the department he told me.", "input": "", "output": "What are you planning to do with this information, Olivia?"}, {"instruction": "Information is power. It means that I have something to hold over him. I have told him to quit e-mailing me. I contacted my ISP--Internet Service Provider--and told them what was going on. They will put a filter to block his e-mails to me. If he changes his e-mail address, he can still e-mail me, but at least my ISP knows what's going on. Their abuse department takes these things seriously. Since he uses his university e-mail address to e-mail me, I'll contact them as well if I need to. But I'd rather hold onto that ace.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "He loves his job and is hoping to get a tenure. If they find out he's abusing their facilities in this way, I'm sure it wouldn't go over well for him. Doc, I don't want to hurt him. I just want him to leave me alone. I've configured my IRC client so that he is on \"ignore\" status and can't talk to me. I've blocked him out of e-mailing me. I think things are going to be okay now. But I'm still worried.", "input": "", "output": "If you have closed those avenues of communication..."}, {"instruction": "He still has my work number, so that's a problem. He knows where I work and can probably find my work e-mail address if he's clever enough. He can also call my father directly.", "input": "", "output": "Let's look at each of these things objectively. Yes, he has your work phone number. It doesn't seem likely that the whole company will change their phone numbers just to keep this man from calling you. So that's not an option. As for your e-mail address, try to see if they can filter him out there as well--block him before he even has the chance to get through."}, {"instruction": "But if I can't stop him from calling me, I can't stop him from calling my father!", "input": "", "output": "Correct."}, {"instruction": "I just hate feeling like I'm at his mercy.", "input": "", "output": "Has he ever threatened to call your father?"}, {"instruction": "Well, no. So, I guess I'm worrying over nothing. I know this is rather trivial compared to the schizos and people with multiple personality disorders you probably see, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks a lot, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "But this is real to me, and I'm frightened. For once, I'd like someone to take me seriously, you know? I'm sick and tired of being this simple-minded showpiece that performs on command, speaks when spoken to, and wears pretty pink bows in her hair. I'm smart, and intelligent, and I'm independent, damn it! I don't need you to trivialize my life, too!", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, please come back in and sit down. I think psychological manipulation and torment is very serious. So let's continue."}, {"instruction": "I need to cool down. I don't know if I'll be back or not. It really sucks to be minimized, you know?", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you might have some issues with your fath..."}, {"instruction": "My life is real and so are the things that happen to me! They might not seem significant enough to warrant media attention, but they are important to me!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Olivia, I respect your desire to let your temper cool before continuing with our conversation.  But I would like to work through this with you and not let this go until our next session. So please sit down. I apologize if I gave you the impression that your situation is insignificant. I do want to help you work through this, Olivia. Let's give it a chance."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry for screaming at you like that, Doctor Balis. But I'd just like to go home now, if you don't mind. What a scene I've made here. Please, I just want to get out and clear my head. I'll be back next week, and we can talk then, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "I understand. But I'll be out of town for the next few weeks."}, {"instruction": "Then I'll call.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Please call me if you need to. Our next session will be Monday, January 26th at 4 pm.  And I can always be reached in an emergency.  Also, a doctor will be covering for me while I'm out of town."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doc. Again, I'm sorry for being so crazy a second ago. I usually don't lose control like that. I'll see you later.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. It's good to see you again.", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, please come in. I'm glad to see that you've come back. Frankly, I was worried after our last session. Please, come in and sit down."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I'm so sorry about our last session. I was just...well, I guess I'm a bit sensitive to how people perceive me. Tissue paper feelings and all.", "input": "", "output": "That's quite all right, Olivia. And again, I do apologize if I somehow gave you the impression that I thought your problem was not serious. But walking out is not acceptable."}, {"instruction": "I understand. It was terribly rude of me and not helpful at all. Now I know you weren't making light of things and I just took things wrong. Well, Jonas won't bother me anymore anyway. I'm pretty sure he won't. And that was why I was here--to get your help understanding him. So I'm pretty pleased to see that we've accomplished what we set out to do.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. I'd be interested in hearing what happened with Jonas."}, {"instruction": "He's been arrested. He's a really bad computer hacker from what I hear. I don't know all the details nor do I care to hear it all. I'm just glad that he's not going to be bothering me anymore.", "input": "", "output": "How did you find all this out?"}, {"instruction": "I got online the day after our last session and was immediately bombarded with people sending me e-mail messages about Jonas. There are various versions of the story, but the bottom line is that he was caught hacking into a server. Evidently, he was posting pirated software and software license numbers. From what I've heard, someone alerted software police or something and his ISP about this. First, his home account was canceled. Then, he was arrested. I called the university and pretended that I was a reporter. I asked a lot of pointed questions and was told that he's on an extended sabbatical and his return was unknown at this time. I e-mailed the abuse desk at his ISP and was told that they had been monitoring his actions and that his account had been terminated for violation of their Terms of Service. I don't know what kind of punishment he's looking at in Denmark, but in the US they usually forbid convicted hackers to use computers as part of their punishment.", "input": "", "output": "I see. I'd expect you to be happier with him out of your life and unable to harm you.  But you don't seem all that relieved."}, {"instruction": "Yeah...well, I have other things on my mind--good things, splendid things, yummy things!", "input": "", "output": "Such as?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I managed a major coup while you were on vacation! Speaking of which, how was your vacation?", "input": "", "output": "Quite relaxing, thank you. What was your coup?"}, {"instruction": "I've been thinking a lot about getting out from under my father's thumb, personally and professionally. I started looking for a new job a couple months ago, but I was very picky about the ones I considered. I did my homework and came to the conclusion that Silicon Impressions was the best place to go. That is also how I found you. I did some snooping and found out that you were covered under their insurance plan. That was why I chose you. My father was bugging me about the bags under my eyes, and always being late to work, and being so tired, so I decided to appease him. In the process, I was allowing him to think he had more control. But actually, I was setting things up to take as much control away from him as possible.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So after our last session, I had a phone message at home from Vince Martinelli asking me to call him as soon as possible. I did, and he offered me a job! I'm in this group called Marketing Imagery. We come up with the logos and fonts and color schemes for all of SII's products. We set up guidelines on how a certain logo should look in color, reverse color, black and white, reverse black and white, and what fonts to use when the first choice font isn't available...all those things. We create the press packs. We work with the legal department to make sure we have everything properly licensed and trademarked. And we work with the graphic designers who come up with the logos. It's really a neat department.", "input": "", "output": "How did your father take the news of your new job?"}, {"instruction": "Not too well, and that's an understatement. He's beside himself. I turned in my notice the day after our last session. But since I had so much vacation time built up, I started working for SII immediately and took my two weeks notice at Stillwell as vacation. Essentially, I got double pay. I knew that if I worked my last two weeks, he'd be on me like white on rice. He would wear me down and make me give up my new job.", "input": "", "output": "Didn't leaving on such short notice put your co-workers in a jam?"}, {"instruction": "Nope. I've been anticipating leaving for several months, so I made sure that I was always up to date on all my work. I even created procedure documents for everything that I do, so the next person just has to follow the steps. I've planned this for a while, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "While I understand your desire for more independence from your father, I hope this hasn't created a permanent rift between the two of you. Are you speaking to each other?"}, {"instruction": "A little. It's still a bit strained. He's shocked that I ventured out on my own like I did, and I guess it hurt his pride a bit. I didn't do it to be spiteful or to make him look bad; I just had to have some breathing space and to know that I can do things on my own. He has always had such a watchful eye on me, and it's a smothering feeling at times.", "input": "", "output": "Parents have a tendency to be protective of their children, Olivia. That's part of the child-rearing process."}, {"instruction": "Not like this. He's not my real father, you know. I'm not even related to him. When he was a teenager--I guess he was around seventeen or eighteen or maybe a bit older, because he had graduated high school--he was working for a moving company. He'd load people's things into trucks, unload them, and put the stuff in the correct places in the house. One day, he was helping unload for this one family, my mother's family. My mother was fifteen, I think; her name was Melissa. While he was unloading the truck, my mother was unpacking some of her things and was kind of putzing around the house. Her family went back to the old house to pack some more and asked my father to keep an eye on her while they were gone. Melissa was in the kitchen when someone came in the kitchen door and attacked her. My father...uh, Eric ran in to see what was going on. The attacker had Melissa on the floor and was going to rape her. Eric tried to pull him off and ended up being knocked out cold. Melissa was raped and became pregnant with me. Eric felt very guilty: he was supposed to be taking care of her and had failed. He felt so obligated that he offered to marry Melissa. She was a wreck. She quit talking; she would rock in place and just rub her belly. She died when I was born. Melissa's parents didn't want me, I only reminded them of the daughter they lost and the shame of the rape. Eric was so consumed with guilt that he felt he had to make it up to Melissa's parents. They allowed him to adopt me as long as he took me away. He moved to California and got into computers.", "input": "", "output": "That's a horrible story!  And it sounds like your adopted father took a lot of responsibility onto himself. What did his family think about all this?"}, {"instruction": "They were in complete shock when Eric offered to marry Melissa, let alone when he adopted me after she died. They just couldn't fathom his guilt. They also thought he'd never be successful or be able to get ahead in life with a baby and no wife. I found a letter at their house once. Eric sent it to them shortly after he adopted me. He told them that even if they couldn't understand why he felt so responsible to Melissa's family, he hoped that with time they would try to accept me.", "input": "", "output": "And did they?"}, {"instruction": "I really don't know. They lived back east, and we hardly ever saw them. They both passed away when I was in elementary school, so I never really knew them. Sometimes I feel like my father is trying so hard to protect me because he wasn't able to protect my mother.", "input": "", "output": "You seem rather dispassionate about all this."}, {"instruction": "Well, I can see why he is so protective and, in a way, I guess I understand it. But I'm on the receiving end of this, and it's hard not to be resentful or angry at the smothering.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay for your father to express his wishes and desires for your life. And while you don't have to do what he wants, it's okay to hear him out. Do you agree?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, that's true. But he becomes so adamant about things sometimes. It's hard to say no to him.", "input": "", "output": "How about \"maybe?\" Saying \"maybe\" doesn't mean yes or no. \"Maybe\" could give you an opportunity to decide for yourself while relieving some of the immediate pressure."}, {"instruction": "I use \"maybe\" a lot and then just don't tell him that the answer is really \"no.\"", "input": "", "output": "Communication is very important, Olivia. If your decision is not to take his advice on something, try explaining your reasons to him. He just might surprise you and accept your decision. You're obviously not a child anymore, but maybe he needs some help cutting the strings."}, {"instruction": "That's no understatement, Doc! Now with my new job, he has even less control, and it's just bugging him something fierce. I think I'm going to make a dinner date with him every week and see if that helps cool him down a bit.", "input": "", "output": "I think that's a wise decision. I don't get the impression that you want to exclude your father from your life.  It sounds like you just want to lessen his impact on your decisions. He may be feeling alienated by you right now."}, {"instruction": "He needs a woman. I've been checking out some of the women at work to see who is single and decent.", "input": "", "output": "Playing Cupid can be a dangerous game, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm not real obvious about it. I've set him up before with my teachers, my friends' mothers and stuff. It's helped take the pressure off me for a while. Don't get me wrong, I want to see him happy. My matchmaking isn't entirely selfish.", "input": "", "output": "I still advise caution. Love isn't something that can be forced or manipulated."}, {"instruction": "I'll be good; I'll be good! But if he won't fish off of his own company's pier, I'll just introduce him to my company's pier. Arranged meetings aren't bad. If nothing happens, nothing happens. I don't send love letters to them and sign them from my father! It's all innocent. I just arrange the first meeting and let nature take its course.", "input": "", "output": "Just be careful, Olivia, okay? It looks like our time is almost up. Before we go, however, I'd like you to consider keeping a journal."}, {"instruction": "Like \"Dear Diary?\"", "input": "", "output": "Not necessarily. Just someplace you jot down your thoughts, feelings, doodles, or anything that comes to mind. You don't have to show it to me, if you don't want to."}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it. I'm doing so much writing at work that it might feel like a chore. But I'll think about it.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Will your new job permit you to keep the same appointment time?"}, {"instruction": "Yup! I go in early and leave early, so it's no big deal. Our group is really informal. As long as we get our stuff done, everyone's happy. I'll see you next week, Doc!", "input": "", "output": "Sounds good, Olivia. Have a good week."}, {"instruction": "Hi ya, Doc, sorry I'm late. Whoops! Sorry about that! I normally don't trip all over furniture. For what it's worth, I normally don't twirl into someone's office, either. I'm just absolutely giddy about life.", "input": "", "output": "That's wonderful. What's been happening..."}, {"instruction": "No need to ask, Doctor. I'm dying to tell you all about everything. My new job is fabulous; I absolutely love it. I've been taking work home on a regular basis and cutting down on my time in the office. My boss, Vince, is really cool about that stuff. And get this--yesterday, I had lunch with some of the secretaries and boy did I get an earful! I told you last week that I was going to do some snooping for a chick for my dad, right? Well, I casually asked the girls if they knew of anyone I could set my father up with. They all burst into peals of laughter and told me that I'd come to the right place for \"office incest.\" My jaw just dropped! Then, I found out what a soap opera SII is! There's one executive woman who was accused of sleeping with a 14-year-old boy and ended up getting the boy's mother fired--the mother worked at SII, too. And one guy is dating a woman here but got their roommate pregnant. That one shocked me. One of the girls tried to tell me that the roommate was really a cousin of the girl who is dating the guy, but I said that was a bit far fetched. But by far, the best one was the nympho who used the guys in her group to get pregnant. I wouldn't have believed that one at all--as a matter of fact, I refused to believe it until they brought out a newspaper article--it made the press. Here, I xeroxed a copy.  I didn't think you'd believe me.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you."}, {"instruction": "You know, when I saw it, I just about passed out. What a hoot this company is. Have I lost you with all of this, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "No, I'm just a bit surprised at the rumor mill at SII."}, {"instruction": "It's vicious, that's for sure. I know I'll be keeping my personal life to myself. It just cracked me up to hear about all the inner-office dating; who was caught kissing whom on the sofas; who sleeps with whom. What a hoot!", "input": "", "output": "I do hope you take it all with a grain of salt, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah...I know better than to believe that it's all 100% true. But there wouldn't be rumors if there weren't some sort of foundation for them. Each rumor has to be based on some sort of fact. I'm pretty sure they are all inflated though.", "input": "", "output": "What else has you so happy today?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my boss said that if I keep up my good work, I'd see a reward at my 3-month review. I'm absolutely tingling with excitement.", "input": "", "output": "That's wonderful! Does your father share the same excitement?"}, {"instruction": "Ugh. I knew we'd be going there today.", "input": "", "output": "No need for the dramatic sigh, Olivia. You need to work through your difficulties with your father. He is your father, after all, and a pretty important part of your life."}, {"instruction": "Hello? Weren't you listening last week, Doc? He's not my father. He's just someone who took over my life and has been trying to make up for his mistake through me.", "input": "", "output": "I seriously doubt the situation is as simplistic as you put it."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, my father is a nice person. He's very generous; he is very intelligent. He is also overbearing. If he were the father of a friend of mine, we'd probably get along wonderfully. But he's not. So I have to work with what I have.", "input": "", "output": "You can't work with what you have by shutting him out. Did you have lunch or dinner with him like you planned?"}, {"instruction": "Nope. He hasn't been answering his phone at home. He doesn't return my calls and has been having his secretary play interference for him when I call him at work. Phyllis is usually pretty slick and will...uh, accidentally let me through to him. He must have put the fear of God into her, because she gets off the phone with me as quickly as possible.", "input": "", "output": "That doesn't sound good."}, {"instruction": "I'm not overly worried about it. He was like this when I decided to go to UC Santa Cruz instead of that uppity Mills College. No way was I going to an all girl-school. Ick! He was so furious with me for even applying to another college that he didn't talk to me for a week. Don't worry, Doc. He always comes around.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think this rift will put any permanent strain on your relationship with your father?"}, {"instruction": "Nah. He's too committed to being the perfect father for any problem to last for very long. Oh, something weird happened this week though. It was really odd. At the time, I thought nothing of it, but now I wonder. At first, I thought my memory was just flaking out on me. But later, I tried really hard to remember and just couldn't, which I think is really odd considering that it was probably such a big event at the time. I mean, kids don't just forget about things like that, you know? Those are the things that make life-long memories.", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, what are you talking about?"}, {"instruction": "Oh sorry, Doc! Guess it would help if I brought you in at the beginning of the thought rather than the middle. See, last week, I went over to my father's to pick up some of my stuff--college yearbooks and such. I was going through a box and came across a picture of me. I looked to be about 5 or 6 years old. The picture was taken at an amusement park, but I swear I've never seen the park before. My father happened to be walking by so I asked him when it was taken. He said I was probably too young to remember and stormed up to his den and shut the door.", "input": "", "output": "Is it an amusement park near here?"}, {"instruction": "It doesn't look like any amusement park I've seen. It looks like it's all about dinosaurs or something. Maybe it's a theme park, not an amusement park with rides. Oh well, I guess I was just too young to remember. It just struck me as odd.", "input": "", "output": "Memories often return at the oddest times. I wouldn't worry about it, Olivia. It's stored in your brain and could come out at any time. Our time is just about up, but before you leave, I'd like to know your thoughts on the journal that I asked you to consider."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah. I thought about it and I think it would be a good thing for our sessions. The only problem is that I'm so overwhelmed right now. I'd probably never remember to write in it. Then, I'd just start to feel guilty for neglecting something that I'd committed to do.", "input": "", "output": "This doesn't need to be a daily entry type of journal. It's just a way for you to write down your thoughts, feelings, any drawings...I don't want you to feel pressured to do this; however, I do think it would help you sort out your feelings."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doc. I'll see what I can come up with this week.", "input": "", "output": "Great, then we'll see each other next Monday."}, {"instruction": "Have a good week, Doc!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "I'm okay, Doc. Really, it looks worse than it feels...sometimes. I was...uh, mugged.", "input": "", "output": "When did this happen?"}, {"instruction": "Friday night. Last week, I was in the legal department talking to this girl, Caren. She introduced me to another \"admin\" there named Stephanie. Stephanie and I really hit it off, so we went out for drinks Friday night. When we left the bar, some guys jumped us and beat us up. Fortunately, other people were leaving the bar and helped fight off the attackers. Someone called the cops, so I spent the night in the emergency room talking to the fuzz.", "input": "", "output": "What did the doctors say? Are you on any medication?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my neck is strained, so I have to wear this brace for a week and monitor how it feels. At first, they thought my nose was broken, but it's not. So aside from bad bruises, I escaped unscathed.", "input": "", "output": "I wouldn't exactly call it unscathed, Olivia. Was your companion hurt as well?"}, {"instruction": "Poor Steffy. They managed to knock out two of her teeth. A fat lip and two less teeth is not a pretty sight. She also has a fractured rib. I'm going to take her some soup tonight and stay with her.", "input": "", "output": "Do the police think they'll be able to apprehend the suspects?"}, {"instruction": "They hope so, and so do we. No one deserves to hurt like this. But I have my doubts about the cops catching anyone.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "They kept giving us funny looks and asking weird questions. Like it's so uncommon for two girls to go out for drinks after work. Sheesh! I mean yeah--Steffy is pretty hot, and I'm no eyesore. But jeez! You'd think, living in San Francisco, they wouldn't bat an eye at two chicks going out for drinks, whether or not they are just friends. The damn cops didn't even patrol the area looking for those creeps. They just asked the people in the bar a few questions and took us to the hospital. Well, I don't plan to be unprepared the next time someone decides to use me as a punching bag.", "input": "", "output": "What are you planning to do?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know how yet, but I'll be ready. Ooooh. All this excitement is making my neck hurt.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry. Can I do something to make you more comfortable?"}, {"instruction": "I'll be all right.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Will your injuries keep you from work?"}, {"instruction": "Nah. Vinnie lets me do a lot of my work at home. He's a pushover, so I'm sure it won't be a problem for a week or so. When I spoke to him this morning, he was really sympathetic. He made a comment about hate crimes being so outrageous in this day and age. That really got my dander up, but I let it slide. If he's willing to let me work from home for a week or two, I'm not about to challenge him on a slip of the tongue. He's a really nice guy. He even offered to bring me some meals and drop off my work so I didn't have to go into the office. I told him that it was really nice but I'd rather come in and get my stuff in the evening when most of the people have left for the day--I don't need people ogling me.", "input": "", "output": "How did your father react to this?"}, {"instruction": "Well, what he doesn't know won't hurt him, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "I don't necessarily agree with that philosophy. I'm sure he'd be upset to find out about this at some later date..."}, {"instruction": "Well, he's the one who blocked me out for the past few weeks. If he doesn't want to know, I'm not going to volunteer the information.", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, I thought you enjoyed having some freedom from your father. That's what getting a job at SII was about, wasn't it? And finding someone for your father to date was about keeping his attention off you. So..."}, {"instruction": "Doesn't make much sense, does it? I guess...well, hmm. I guess it's about security.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, go on."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's nice to have someone care for you. He's taken care of me, and I do love him. No one else wanted me, but he did. He has taken care of me all my life. He is all I have--like it or not--so when he's not there, it really is a punishment for me. Doc, if the only thing in the world you had for a companion was an ugly cat that scratched you and hissed at you most of the time but was always there, you'd miss it if it left. That's kind of how I feel about my father. I don't want him gone completely. I don't want to shut him out, nor do I want to be shut out of his life. I just want a lesser degree of butt-in-ski-ness.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds reasonable, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Actually, what I need right now are a few painkillers. Do you mind if we end a bit early today, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "Sure. Please take it easy, Olivia. And give some thought to breaking through your father's silence. He probably misses you."}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it. Thanks for letting me out early. I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Better, much better. Thanks for asking. I've been getting headaches, but the doctor said that will subside once my neck is back to 100% working order. Since most of the bruising is gone, I'm back to work. Unfortunately, staying away from work didn't stop the rumor mill. SII is just thick with grapevines. And I'm sure that making a scene in one of the lounges didn't help either.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Last Wednesday, the cops came to SII to see Steffy and me. They picked up a couple of punks and were holding them for questioning. They wanted us to come down and ID the kids, so we did. The whole way down to the station, I was scared to death. I was so afraid that they'd know it was Steffy and I, and that they would come after us again. I know the chances of that happening are slim, but I was still petrified.", "input": "", "output": "That's an understandable fear, Olivia. It takes a lot of courage to try to help the police catch these men. So many crimes remain unsolved--some never even get reported--because the victims are scared. You did the right thing, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Well, once I got there, I calmed down some. Steffy and I did the ID's separately. And, sure enough, we identified the punks that beat the crap out of us. We hung around a bit longer to talk to the cops, to go over our statements, to find out about what happens next. But then another cop came in and called out the other cops. When the first group of cops came back in, they told us that they had to let those little creeps go! I was so furious! I could see the steam shooting out of my ears!", "input": "", "output": "Why did they let them go?"}, {"instruction": "Those punks have diplomatic immunity! Can you freaking believe it? Their parents are diplomats in DC; they are going to school out here and can do whatever the hell they want with no repercussions! Steffy and I just stood there in shock. Then, we saw them walking down the hall together. They were laughing. Laughing! I charged at them, but the cops held me back. I swear I would have torn out their eyes and shoved them in their filthy little mouths! I just wanted to claw their skin off. When we got back to work, Steffy and I were screaming at each other in the lounge. I just started kicking things and throwing things. Steffy punched me in the stomach and told me to chill. Then we both just started sobbing. We just stood there, the room in total disarray, holding each other and crying.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Olivia.  You didn't get justice. What do you think makes you the angriest about this whole thing?"}, {"instruction": "All of it! Every single stinking part of it. I'm angry that it happened, that we were beat up, that people thought we were gay, that the butt-heads didn't have to pay for what they did, that they were laughing. Laughing...", "input": "", "output": "The tissues are right there on the table. Olivia, let's work on your anger. First, I think it is important to understand what has hurt you. Although it's fairly obvious, let's discuss it anyway, all right?"}, {"instruction": "Well, those guys hurt me. They hurt me physically and emotionally. I could have fallen off my bike and been hurt just as much physically. But this is different. I don't feel safe anymore; I'm afraid that someone else is going to prey on me again. I feel like a walking target. And when they laughed, it was like all the air was sucked out of my lungs.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think can make you feel well again?"}, {"instruction": "I need to feel safe. When I thought that they were going to pay for their crime, it helped. But that's not going to happen.", "input": "", "output": "They still might be punished, Olivia. Often times, colleges and universities will enforce some kind of punishment for inappropriate behavior, especially when there are legal ramifications involved.  And I think that I would get the police to file a report with the State Department.  Although these kids can't be prosecuted here in the United States, the State Department may decide to expel them.  Maybe you can create a diplomatic incident."}, {"instruction": "Yeah!  Actually, that's a bit comforting. I feel so helpless knowing that they will get away with this and not have to pay for what they did. It seems like they have carte blanche to do this any time they want!", "input": "", "output": "I'd like you to talk about what happened--how it has affected you and how it makes you feel. I'd also like you to talk about what you feel you need to get past this. And you don't have to just talk to me about this. Talk to your friends, your father, your co-workers, and talk to Steffy. It would make you feel better to release your feelings this way."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't really like people to know my business.", "input": "", "output": "Just think of yourself as a balloon filled with air. Every time you talk about what happened, you will be releasing a bit of your anger, just like releasing air out of the balloon. Talking about it will help take the sting out and help you move closer to overcoming this."}, {"instruction": "I understand. I shouldn't keep it all pent up inside me.", "input": "", "output": "That's right. It will help you accept what has happened and move forward with your life. Mind you, I'm not advocating becoming obsessed with what happened. Rather, I'd like you to get to the point where you feel comfortable talking about what happened without any undue rage or anger. That will be our goal, okay?"}, {"instruction": "I can do that. It does help to talk about it. I like talking to Steffy about it, because she understands how I feel. Steffy is still pretty sore. She's back at work, but it will take a while for her ribs to be completely healed. She's still so shook up about the whole thing. She even went to the woman in charge of security at SII to see if it would be okay to bring a dog to work. Steffy wants to get a guard dog, and she said she plans to take it with her everywhere. I told her that wasn't very practical, but she is insisting on taking the dog to work with her. It should be interesting. SII is pretty accommodating with its employees. I even heard that some of the guys get together and watch porn in the conference rooms after work! Anyway, the company is pretty liberal--with its flexible work hours, work at home situations, and all that--but bringing a dog to work? I'm not so sure how well that will fly.", "input": "", "output": "It would make for a very unique work environment."}, {"instruction": "You know, Doc, I do feel better. I can breathe, and don't feel so weighted down. I'm still really pissed about everything that has happened, but I can think about other things. Oh, this past week, I was down in the accounting department getting info on the advertising budgets for the different projects. We have to know how much money we can spend. And even though the project manager tells us we can have the moon, we know better and double check everything. Well, anyway, I was down there talking to this really nice guy, Jeff, when his boss came in. Wow, you want to talk about a cold, hard, executive woman! She's all business, let me tell you. Jeff said she's a good boss--fair and helpful and all that. I don't know though. If making the big bucks means you have to have this ultra-bitch persona and be so aloof, I don't think it's something that I want for myself.", "input": "", "output": "Are you interested in becoming an executive?"}, {"instruction": "Heck no, Doc! Not yet, anyway. I know I don't want to be a peon at the bottom of the barrel, but I'm not so sure the top of the heap is any better. I must say, though, there's something about that Ms. Lippard that is unique. There was a glimmer in her eye or something. I bet she's a real nice person and just has to be a bitch for work.", "input": "", "output": "Some people feel more comfortable in their work environment when the roles of leadership and responsibility are clearly defined."}, {"instruction": "I guess.", "input": "", "output": "We are out of time, Olivia. But before you leave, I want you to know that I think you're doing wonderfully. We will work together to get past this anger, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sounds groovy, Doc! See, I'm even snickering and being my old silly self.", "input": "", "output": "Some days will be easier than others, so please keep that in mind. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "See you, Doc!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Well, Doc, today we're going to need the couch.", "input": "", "output": "Pardon me? And hello, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "All hell has broken loose! I never thought I'd do the stereotypical shrink-thing and lay down on a couch, but let me tell you, I just want to sink in and never come back out.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I took your advice and told my father what happened. You should have seen the fireworks. You'd have thought they raped me and peeled my skin off from the way he acted. He immediately got on the phone with his attorney. Somehow, they got the names of the creeps who did this, and now my father is planning to sue those punks' parents. He blew his top when he found out that the boys are brothers. I think they are a year apart in school. I'm sure the neighbors heard my father bellowing on the phone with Mr. Bergen, our attorney. He was yelling about attempted manslaughter, pain and suffering, mental anguish, and all this stuff. Uh, I can just see us on the Jerry Springer show now. His face was an odd shade of purple, and he just kept storming around the den, pacing back and forth while muttering to himself. He'd stop every once in a while and bang his fist on the desk. It was a terrible scene. The housekeeper kept checking in on us. Later, she told me that she thought he was going to have a heart attack because his face was so red.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, that was last Monday after our session. I finally got home and tried to sleep. I was up almost the whole night. My mind was just racing. Now that my dad is calling all his attack lawyers, I'm scared that these punks will come after Steffy and me again.", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think that would only bring more attention to their actions and cause more problems for them?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, they have a heck of a problem coming their way as it is. My father even called the State Department. He's hounding them to do something about the incident. He said he won't rest until those hoodlums receive justice. He has even threatened to go to the press and make a big scene in the papers about this. I know for a fact that he's spoken with a writer for the Washington Post. Doctor, will you adopt me please? I need a sane father.", "input": "", "output": "Now, Olivia..."}, {"instruction": "I know--work with what you have. He's become such a freak, though. Doctor, look at my nails--they're all bitten down to the quick. My cuticles are all scabbed from picking at them. I can't concentrate at work. We had a staff meeting last Wednesday, and all I did was doodle. Here, take a look.  Vinny kept giving me weird looks, so now I have to worry about my job, too. I'm going insane.", "input": "", "output": "You do seem to be under a lot of stress."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Stressed, uptight, upset, scared, and angry. That's an accurate description, do you agree?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Very stressed and very scared. I'm so jumpy. I can't sleep at night because I hear things. Every little bump, creak, or moan of the wind has me curled up in a ball, shivering. But what burns me up the most is that my father never once asked me how I am doing. He just went on this Alpha-rampage and became this Neanderthal man protecting his territory. I don't think he's stopped once to think how this all might turn around and bite him--or more likely me!--in the butt. If he makes all of this public knowledge, then the creeps will know my name and will be able to find me. They might hurt me again. I spent the weekend in my townhouse with the doors all double and triple locked, the curtains pulled, and no lights on. When it got dark, I didn't turn on any lights. I don't answer my phone or my door anymore. I have even been sleeping at work at night, so I don't have to go home after dark. My boss thinks I'm totally loony.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like your fear has really taken over. Let's work on that. You are a victim of a random attack."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "They didn't premeditate their attack on you. That means that you are anonymous to them. Although they might remember what you looked like, they don't know your name."}, {"instruction": "Uh huh.", "input": "", "output": "Except for seeing you as they left the police station, they have no way of knowing who you are. Doesn't it seem logical that they can't know your name or where you live?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess. But Steffy said that they could have followed us when we left the police station and then followed us home when we left work that day.", "input": "", "output": "That would take a considerable amount of determination on their part. What reason would they have? They were in no danger of legal recourse because of their diplomatic immunity. It seems to me that they would have nothing to gain by standing outside your office to watch you."}, {"instruction": "I don't know. I just don't feel safe. Are guns legal in California? Do you know what I would need to do to get a gun?", "input": "", "output": "A gun, Olivia? There are other alternatives available to you besides firearms."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I guess I could get a dog like Steffy did. She tried bringing that monster to work and was escorted out of the building. I'm no authority on dogs, but I think she has a real problem on her hands. She wanted a mean, tough dog, and that's what she has now.", "input": "", "output": "What breed did she choose?"}, {"instruction": "A Rottweiler. His name is Chain Saw. She has no idea what she's doing. I think the dog is dangerous.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, I've done some checking, too. I've been talking to some rescue groups that handle the adoption of abandoned Rottweilers, and it sounds like Steffy has a poorly socialized dog that is going to hurt someone. She got the dog from a guy who kept Chain Saw chained in his backyard. The dog had almost no socialization. It scares me. Steffy's going to wish she'd listened to me when that dog bites someone. But then, she says that's why she got the dog--she wants it to bite anyone who messed with her. I think she's confusing loyalty with lunacy. She does have a good idea though.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, a barking dog is a deterrent to any intruder. It might be worth looking into. It would be better than getting a gun, at least for me it would be.", "input": "", "output": "I hope you plan on doing some research before you make any final decisions."}, {"instruction": "You know how I plan things out, Doc. I'll be sure to do some research first. I couldn't imagine making any decisions without thinking through all the possible consequences. I just want to feel safe again. I've even considered moving back in with my father.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "I wouldn't give up my place, but I've considered just staying with him for a bit. I was staying with Steffy for a while, until she got Chain Saw. He growled at me a few times, and I decided that I'd rather be safe than sorry when it comes to bone-crushing power.", "input": "", "output": "Last week, we talked about letting out some of your anger by talking to other people. How is that going?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. One day, I spent about an hour in Caren's cube talking about it. I don't think she'd gossip about me, so I felt safe telling her. She told me that people think Steffy and I are lovers. I just snorted at that--as if. Oh, I also called a couple of college friends and ran up a healthy long distance bill. It was good to catch up with them, even if it was to tell them about the horrors of my life.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think talking about your attack has helped?"}, {"instruction": "A little, I guess. I'm not so much angry as I am scared. Doc, I'm trying so hard to be rational about this and not be paranoid. But sometimes, I get this feeling deep in my gut that I should run screaming and just hide for a few months. I don't like the feeling. Damn, there aren't any tissues left.", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, there is no need to throw things. Here is a new box. While I encourage you to express yourself freely here, please try not to be destructive."}, {"instruction": "God, I'm so sorry, Doc. I'm acting like a brat. I just want to close my eyes and know that when I open them, all this will be gone.", "input": "", "output": "One step at a time; one day at a time, Olivia. You can work through this. I'm going to be here for you and help you. Remember that you can call me anytime you need to talk. If I'm not here, my service can find me. Are you still taking the Melatonin?"}, {"instruction": "No. Actually, I'm all out and should pick up a new bottle.", "input": "", "output": "Just get them downstairs on your way out. I'd like you to start taking them again to help you fall asleep."}, {"instruction": "Sure. Thanks. I guess our time is up, huh?", "input": "", "output": "Just about. I want you to try to focus on one day at a time, okay? I know you are worrying about a lot of things and that you're scared. Try to stay focused on each day as it comes. I think doing so will help you relieve some of your anxiety."}, {"instruction": "I'll try, Doc. I'll see you next week. And again, I'm sorry I threw that tissue box.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay; it was light. Have a good week, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Um, I'm okay. It's been a weird day.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, how so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it started off when I walked in on a sultry phone call. Talk about weird! I went down to payroll to get some tax stuff straightened out. The admin down there told me to talk to Gary Hindle, and I headed to his office. The door was partly open, so I walked in. Now, I don't have virgin ears, so nothing he said really shocked me. But to hear it coming from someone and then have to talk to him about your paycheck...well, it's just really weird. He was totally embarrassed and kept stuttering and sweating. He kind of gave me the creeps. I was glad to finally get out of his office.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like an uncomfortable situation for both of you."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. At least I didn't burst out laughing. Caren just about fell out of her chair laughing when I told her about it.", "input": "", "output": "What else happened today?"}, {"instruction": "I had a reporter call me. It really freaked me out. Evidently, my father has been blabbing to any and every reporter he can find.", "input": "", "output": "Evidently? I thought you were going to move in with your father for a while. Didn't he mention it?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, good Lord. I could only handle being there for one night, Doc. He was even more smothering than I remembered. The one night I was there, I couldn't sleep, so I stayed up watching cable all night. He must have came down at least a dozen times to check on me. Finally, I threw a pillow at him, and he finally got the hint. Oh, but wait! I have some juicy news for you, Doc. Remember I told you about the executive at SII who was having an affair with a 14-year-old kid? Well get this, I saw them together.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Uh huh. And man, what a doll he is! No wonder she's rolling in the hay with him. He was carrying out some gifts. I bet they were presents from her for her boy-toy. They were wrapped kind of girly, so maybe not. He looks a lot older than fourteen, so I have a feeling that someone exaggerated on his age.", "input": "", "output": "Rumors are often inflated, Olivia. I wouldn't put too much faith in any of it being true."}, {"instruction": "Oh? Hey, do you know these two, Doc?", "input": "", "output": "When have you ever known such an outrageous rumor to be true, Olivia? Just think about the rumors about you and Stephanie being lovers."}, {"instruction": "Nice soft-shoe there, Doc. I see what you mean, though. Oh heck. It's more fun to believe the rumors.", "input": "", "output": "Even when they are so blatantly untrue as those about you and Stephanie?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I can see how people would think that about Steffy and me. We do hang out together a lot, and we do sleep over at each other's houses, and sometimes come in to work wearing each other's clothes. But I figure that if people want to know the truth, they'll just ask.", "input": "", "output": "Then I suggest you take your own advice and ask this executive about her supposed affair with the underage son of one of her co-workers."}, {"instruction": "Ouch! Calling the kettle black and all that, eh? The rumors are more fun.", "input": "", "output": "What is the saying? \"Sometimes, truth is stranger than fiction.\""}, {"instruction": "Ha! No kidding. I found out that an old friend of mine was kicked out by her husband. This was after she suggested that they each have one affair to help spice up their sex lives. Well, he did, and he fell in love. Now, she's at her wits end--no job skills, a small child to care for, and no hope of creating a decent income to support herself and her daughter. And all this after she herself had an affair first and was thinking about leaving him. What a mess.", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, let's talk about you, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, sure. I just thought that this little anecdote fit in well with the flow of our conversation.", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned earlier about a reporter calling you. Tell me about what is happening with that."}, {"instruction": "Nothing, nada, zippo, zero, ka-pooey. I'm not talking to reporters, or to lawyers, or to government officials--including the fuzz--or to my father. I don't feel strong enough to let all these strangers in so that they can examine my life, and poke and prod, and ask all sorts of personal questions. Speaking of attorneys, I have a joke for you: A famous lawyer finds himself at heaven's gates confronting Saint Peter. He protests that it is all a mistake--he's only forty-nine and far too young to be dead. \"That's odd,\" says Saint Peter, \"according to the hours you've billed, you're one hundred and nineteen years old.\"", "input": "", "output": "That's amusing, Olivia. I'm glad that it's not a psychiatrist joke.  But you do realize that you're avoiding any discussion relevant to your attack, don't you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want to talk about it today, Doc. Is that okay?", "input": "", "output": "I don't recommend it for the long term, but I think it'll be okay to discuss something else today."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, Doc. By the way, I found a chick for my dad. At least, I think she's a possibility. Her name is Barbara, and she's not hard on the eyes, if you know what I mean. I'm going to do some snooping and see if she's attached or anything.", "input": "", "output": "How did you meet Barbara?"}, {"instruction": "She works at SII, of course. I saw her in passing and asked Vinny who she was. Vinny grinned and told me her name. When I asked what the big goofy grin was about, he changed the subject. Oh, that's the other weird thing that happened today. Vinny asked me to have a dinner meeting with him tonight. I was pretty shocked. He really took me off guard with that one. Since he said it was a meeting, I said okay. I'm assuming that Brad and Kelly will be there, too. They're the other two people in our group. I got the impression it's one of those Dilbert-Management, team-building types of things.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes it helps morale and productivity to do things outside of the office."}, {"instruction": "We'll see. I'm not so sure I want to spend my off-time socializing with the people from work.", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, have you been sleeping well? You seem a bit edgy."}, {"instruction": "Doc, that melatonin stuff is not working very well. Besides, I'm not sleepy. I guess I get about 3 or 4 hours of sleep a night. But I'm getting up every couple hours to take the puppy out.", "input": "", "output": "You have a puppy?"}, {"instruction": "Yup! I adopted her Friday night. She's a nine weeks old Rottweiler named Sherman. They found her tied to the mailbox of the animal hospital one morning. She'd been left out all night and was shivering when they brought her in. The vet kept her at the hospital and has had her for about 2 weeks now. She's so cute! She's only eleven pounds. The vet said she's going to gain about ten pounds every month and will be around ninety or a hundred pounds when she's full-grown. I'll bring some pictures in next time to show you.", "input": "", "output": "What made you decide to adopt a puppy?"}, {"instruction": "I told you that I'd been talking with a Rottweiler rescue group, right? Well Judy, the woman who runs the rescue, has been giving me lots of information about Rottweilers. I joined an e-mail list about Rotties and have read a ton of books in the past couple weeks. Judy wouldn't let me adopt a Rott from her organization because they don't adopt out guard dogs, only family pets. At first, that irritated me, then I realized that it's her organization and she can do what she wants. I can respect that. We talked about it for a while, and she told me that while Rottweilers are territorial, they are even more social. Lots of times, they become problems, like Chain Saw, when people leave them outside to be guard dogs and don't make them a part of the family. Anyway, I saw an ad in the paper about this puppy and checked it out. The vet said I could adopt Sherman only if I promised to take good care of her, get her spayed, and bring her in for all her shots. I can do that! Besides, if I have the dog from a really young age, she'll bond with me and be more likely to protect me later on.", "input": "", "output": "Puppies are a lot of work, as I'm sure you're realizing. I'm glad that you plan on being responsible about this dog, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "You know, even though Sherman is just a teeny little thing, I feel safer having her. When I told my father about Sherman, he laughed. I told him that if someone were to break into my house, I could shout, \"Stop! Or I'll throw my puppy at you!\" Of course, I wouldn't do that, but it was funny to think about.", "input": "", "output": "Looks like we are out of time, Olivia. Next week, I'd like to talk some more about your attack and how you are doing, all right?"}, {"instruction": "I'll be ready, Doc. Thanks for letting me off the hook this week. I can't come in next week, but I'll see you the week after, okay?", "input": "", "output": "I guess it's all right, as long as it's not a stalling technique."}, {"instruction": "No, no.  It's legitimate.  Thanks.  Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Hiya, Doc. Before we get into the session, I want to show you these pictures of Sherman. Isn't she a doll? She looks so sweet and cute. My favorite is that one, where her tongue is sticking out.", "input": "", "output": "These are very sweet pictures."}, {"instruction": "Well, I never dreamed that a puppy would be so much work, but I still love the little booger. She's chewing everything. And she howls during the night to be let outside, jumps everywhere, and uses my hand as a teething ring. It will be nice once she's completely housebroken and can be trusted to roam around the house. Okay, enough procrastination. I'm ready, Doc. There are two things I'd like to discuss today: my anger and my fear.", "input": "", "output": "They sound like good starting points. Let's begin with your anger."}, {"instruction": "I'm still angry with those punks. But It's not a burning hatred kind of anger. It's more a \"why me?\" kind of anger. At first, I would have welcomed a chance to tear them apart with my bare hands. Now, I think that they have a good change of not becoming a homicide statistic if our paths cross.", "input": "", "output": "What do feel has contributed to this change?"}, {"instruction": "Talking about it helped. Well, talking to everyone except my father helped. Sheesh, he's such a nut case sometimes. But I actually became tired of talking about it. Every time I'd tell someone about what happened to me and Steffy, I would shorten the story leaving out more details each time.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I guess because the details aren't that important to me anymore. I'm not exactly sure. Family friends asked me about it the other day, and I basically told them that I was mugged outside a bar and that the men who did it were not going to be prosecuted. That was it--no details, no long drawn out description of the agonies, nothing about the cops or the hospital. It was all very to the point. They were aghast and thought it was terrible that the crime would go unpunished. While I agreed with those sentiments, I also realized that there really isn't much I can do about it.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds as though you're beginning to let go."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess I am. It still pisses me off, but I don't feel the need to scream and throw things anymore. Having Sherman has helped as well.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "She's a handful, Doc. Spawn of the devil, I'm sure. Nah, she's not that bad, she's just an energetic and mischievous puppy. She takes up a lot of my time and attention. I've been spending a lot of my time playing with her and teaching her what is good and what is bad. I've noticed that when I play with her, I tend to forget about the attack. I feel calmer with her. They say that animals are great for therapy, and I can understand why. Puppy licks can make anyone smile. She's always so happy to see me and play with me, and I've just fallen in love with her little antics. Here I thought I was going to get this big guard dog to protect me. Instead, her love has helped me in a much more significant way.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "In a small way, I feel important because of her. She really does depend on me and not just for food and shelter, but for love and nurturing and training. She is a lot of responsibility, not as much as a kid, but still a big responsibility.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have pets growing up?"}, {"instruction": "Just a few fish. My father bought a really nice tank and some tropical fish. They didn't last long, though. I had a friend over to play one day, and she boiled them.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Since they were tropical fish, the tank's temperature had to be regulated. Robin decided to play with the neat glowing thing in the water--the thermostat--and essentially boiled the fish. Boy, was my father mad! I think we had the whole set up for maybe a month when that happened. But why do you ask? Do you think something was lacking in my childhood?", "input": "", "output": "Knowing your background helps me to understand who you are. I wasn't probing for childhood trauma, Olivia, I was just curious. Let's get back on track and discuss your fear for a bit, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. The fear is still there, but I'm not paranoid anymore. I can't believe I actually spent a whole weekend in the dark. I'm still extra cautious, and I suppose I will be for a while. Doc, for about a week, I was like that guy in the movie \"Conspiracy Theory,\" the guy who put a toothpick in his door so he could tell if anyone had broken in while he was out and who put an upside down glass bottle on the door knob so it would fall and break if someone tried to enter his apartment. I felt like him for a while. It was so stressful. I wanted to jump into my car and just drive and drive to anywhere, to nowhere, to just any place but here.", "input": "", "output": "Do you still want to run?"}, {"instruction": "No, I can't. All along, I've known that I have to face this. But it was even scary to talk to you about it. I kept imagining myself as that balloon filling up with air, and I'd rather let out all the air than pop.", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned since the attack, that you've become more cautious. How so?"}, {"instruction": "I bought pepper spray and an air horn. They're both small, so I keep them on my key ring. I double check all the doors and windows. I lock my car doors when I'm in the car. I always look around when I step out of the door of a building. I don't walk Sherman after dark. I call and check in with someone whenever I get home, so there's always a person who can say when they last heard from me. I carry a cordless phone with me in the house, and I always have my cell phone on. It's all things like that. Sounds pretty paranoid, doesn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Most of this sounds like common sense for a woman living alone. And I'm glad that you're being careful. I'm even more pleased with the progress you've made in overcoming your fears. I worried that you might let your fear keep you from living your life."}, {"instruction": "I know. It's not healthy to be so afraid of something that you can't turn on the lights in your own home. And being scared all the time really took its toll on me. That's part of why Vinnie asked me out to dinner.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, that was a team meeting as I remember, correct?"}, {"instruction": "It was. I was a little afraid that Brad and Kelly wouldn't show up, but they did. We all had a good time. We went out for Mexican and we all got a bit sloshed on margaritas. It was nice to see them outside of work. It kind of gave me some new insights about them.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I had thought Kelly was an airhead, but she's not. She's actually quite intelligent and rather witty, too. She just doesn't say much at work, and when she does, it's usually an off-the-wall comment that makes no sense to anyone but her. But she's pretty decent. She's married to someone at Apple and said that things were a bit tense at home for her back when SII made a play for it. Brad is pretty cool, too. He's a flaming queen, incredibly artistic, and has a really wry sense of humor. He showed up for dinner in drag! I thought Vinny's jaw was going to hit the floor. I laughed so hard. By the end of the evening, Brad and I set a date to go shopping together. He says that he prefers shopping for his drag clothes with a girl, so they can both go ga-ga over the price tags. I like him a lot. He came over one night last week and had dinner with me. Sherman adored him.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like the team building effort was successful."}, {"instruction": "It was nice. I learned a lot about Vinny, too. Actually, I didn't really learn anything specific about him, but I got the impression he was a decent guy. Brad told me that Vinny is a widower; his wife died of ovarian cancer a couple of years ago. Before that, Vinny was a real mover and shaker on the stock market. But when his wife died, he just lost it. He didn't have a full-blown nervous breakdown, but he was definitely a changed man. He moved out here and got in with SII. It made me realize something.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Here, I thought my life was falling apart and that no one could possibly understand what I was going through. Then I found out that these people with which I work, talk, sit, eat, and joke everyday all have their own dramas. Sometimes you never get to know what's going on in people's lives or what they are facing each day.", "input": "", "output": "Quite true. You'll find that by helping friends through their own problems will lessen the impact of--what was your phrase?--the drama in your own life."}, {"instruction": "Definitely. Whenever I'm really down, I like to do something for someone else, like buying a card or a scented candle for the person or sending a note. This takes my mind off of my problem and gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside. We're probably almost out of time, but I wanted to tell you that I've been giving a lot of thought to what you said.", "input": "", "output": "About what?"}, {"instruction": "About confronting that executive on the rumors of her and that kid.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Well, \"confront\" isn't exactly the right word. I've been thinking about what you've said, and I feel that she has a right to know what people are saying. I'm not going to jump out from behind an office plant and accuse her or anything. Who knows, I might not do anything at all. But when I thought about it, I realized that personally I would rather know what people were saying than to be ignorant of it. If I say anything at all, it won't be for a while. She looks like she got mugged, too. She's been limping around and seems jumpy. Being told about some stupid rumors is probably the last thing she needs right now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm out of here, Doc. Got to run home and let Sherman out. See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Good afternoon, Olivia. It's good to see you today. I'm sorry you had to cancel your last session."}, {"instruction": "Good to see you, too. Yes, sorry about that. I had an opportunity to take a few days off and get away from the city life, so I took advantage of it. It was really relaxing.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad."}, {"instruction": "My father had booked a few cabins for a weekend excursion with some of the executives from Stillwell Enterprises.  It's the type of excursion where executives can get away from the office and family, drink beer, and do manly things on the company tab. Male bonding, I suppose. Unfortunately for them, a big proposal came in, and they had to cancel their trip. They couldn't get a refund on the cabins on such short notice. So Phyllis, dad's secretary, called me and asked if I wanted to use a cabin for an extended weekend. And I was more than willing to relieve them of their burden! Sherman and I had a blast!", "input": "", "output": "Lake Tahoe?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah! God was it fabulous! The snow was just gorgeous. A snowboard camp had just finished the day before I got there, so a lot of people from the camp hung around for the weekend to practice and goof off. I've never snowboarded in my life, but it was so cool to watch some of those guys clown around. You could tell who the serious ones were--you know, the fanatics--and who the vacationers were. Mmm! I just want to hug myself when I think about how much fun it was! I met some really great people, too.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, this one guy...what a dream! Oh, jeez! That sounded so fifties. But when I looked into his blue eyes, I just wanted to melt. There are beautiful people in this world, and he's one of them. Jordan and I had dinner together a few times. It was so nice to have someone be so considerate and attentive to me. Most guys are like an octopus with tentacles that just want to flail about attacking wherever they can and clinging like a leech. Uh, no offense, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "None taken, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "I guess I'm a prude that way, but I've never felt comfortable being that...uh, accommodating.", "input": "", "output": "Have you dated much?"}, {"instruction": "No, I've never really been too attracted to anyone in particular. There have been guys that I considered handsome or cute, but none of them really completely appealed to me. Besides, I was too busy earning good grades for my father.", "input": "", "output": "How was your social life in college? I believe you mentioned previously that you opted for a more liberal school rather than the strict school your father chose for you."}, {"instruction": "That was more to peeve him than to party, although a good deal of partying did go on. I was more the \"giggly-drunk\" than the \"mattress-back\" sorority girl. I had a few casual dates, but no relationships. Like I said, no one seems to be able to elicit strong feelings from me. I guess I just haven't met Mr. Right yet. But I sure had a blast up at Lake Tahoe. It reminded me a bit of the carefree partying from school.", "input": "", "output": "It seems that your get away was just what the doctor ordered, as it were."}, {"instruction": "Ha! Funny, Doc. I really needed that break. I was feeling so...so...snowed under lately. See, I can do the puns, too.", "input": "", "output": "I know how avalanching circumstances can make you feel buried. But joking aside, Olivia, please tell me what has you feeling so stressed."}, {"instruction": "You'd think it was work, but it's not. My workload at the office has actually been exhilarating. It's my father. He's been putting pressure on me to proceed with legal action against the guys that attacked me. Between my father, his attorney, the attorney's associates and secretaries my answering machine is on overload. I'm past the \"maybe\" stage with this. I feel like a trapped animal. Eventually, I'll have to sit down and meet with these people. And don't think that just because I haven't mentioned it that the reporters have given up. There are a few who are holding onto this story for dear life.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Maybe Monica Lewinsky can come out with some new tidbit about the President, and all the scum sucking reporters will drop me like a hot potato. Wishful thinking, eh?", "input": "", "output": "It's been a while since your attack, and the reporters are still interested? Something must be feeding their interest."}, {"instruction": "Someone. Daddy dearest, who else? He accidentally on purpose let Steffy's name slip, so the reporters swooped down on the other victim. Poor Steffy. She was so confused and surprised that she told them enough to pique their interests further. She's pretty pissed that my father gave them her name. I don't blame her much; I'm in the same boat. Oh, Steffy's going to North Carolina in April and has asked me to go with her. She's going to some Communications Exchange meeting or something and will visit some of her family while out there.", "input": "", "output": "That's very nice of her."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  I'll get to be introduced to her whole family.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you think that Steffy may have romantic intentions towards you, Olivia?"}, {"instruction": "Pardon me?", "input": "", "output": "Well, is it possible that she is enamored with you?"}, {"instruction": "What are you talking about?", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, it's just a question. I don't know Stephanie, you do. Could she have a romantic interest in you?"}, {"instruction": "I see. So you think I'm a....that...that I...this is ludicrous! I don't have to sit here and have you judge me and make these preposterous accusations about my character and personal life. I am not even sexually active, let alone interested in...in....How dare you assume such a thing about me! Really, Doctor Balis. Up until now, I've considered you a rather non-judgemental person, but this is beyond comprehension.", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, I'm not making any assumptions or judgments about you. Rather, I'm exploring a possibility regarding someone else's intentions towards you."}, {"instruction": "And what makes you think that I would attract the attention of a...", "input": "", "output": "Lesbian. The word is lesbian, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "I know what that word is, Doctor. I'm just a bit ruffled at the moment and having a hard time thinking clearly. This revelation of your perspective on me is quite insulting.", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, this is not an assessment of who you are. Stephanie has become very close to you in the past few months. And I'm glad that you have her friendship. I just wanted to ask you if there was a possibility that she wanted more than friendship from you. And just because someone hasn't came out and pointedly told you the intimate details of their life, doesn't mean that the possibility is not there."}, {"instruction": "But why on earth would you think she was interested in me if you didn't think that I'm....that I'm like that, too?", "input": "", "output": "One does not imply the other, Olivia. If a gay man was attracted to me, it wouldn't mean that I am gay simply because he desires me. If a heterosexual woman was to fall in love with a homosexual man, what does that say? Simply that we can't always control who we're attracted to. It's nothing more, nothing less."}, {"instruction": "But...", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to see that I've offended you, Olivia. That was not my intention."}, {"instruction": "It's just...I don't know. This is all so...argh!", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, in general terms, how do you feel about homosexuality?"}, {"instruction": "Are you gay?", "input": "", "output": "We're not here to talk about me, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "So you are. I see.", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, I'm sensing that you do gave a problem with homosexuality. Right?"}, {"instruction": "I...I don't think...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "If you do, you can tell me. You don't have to worry about how I feel about it or whether I'll judge you based on your feelings about homosexuality. I don't judge my patients' lives, nor do I push my opinions on them. What I want to do here is help you understand who you are."}, {"instruction": "But I don't see any pictures of your wife or children, for example.", "input": "", "output": "Well, imagine how those pictures might look to a patient who was grieving the loss of a child, for example.  Or if I had happy family pictures, might it stifle the honest responses of a young man who was questioning his own sexuality? Can you see how detrimental that might be in therapy?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes.", "input": "", "output": "Because I want to help my patients progress in their therapy, I leave my personal life at the door. I'm here as your doctor. I'm not unfeeling, but I try to be as non-judgemental, non-critical, and as neutral as possible."}, {"instruction": "So, are you gay?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not gay, OIivia.  This subject is clearly causing you a lot of discomfort. Let's move on. Where in North Carolina will you be visiting?"}, {"instruction": "It's a suburb of the Raleigh-Durham area. Our plans aren't firm yet. Steffy has been doing some freelance stuff for another company, and they'd like her to attend this function.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Will you attend the conference as well?"}, {"instruction": "No, I think I'll just...um, hang out and stuff. There are some great outlet malls in the Burlington area, so we might go down there. Doc, I have a raging headache. Would you mind if we ended a bit early?", "input": "", "output": "Before you go, Olivia..."}, {"instruction": "Yes?", "input": "", "output": "Let's plan to talk about your childhood a bit more next session, okay? I'd like to have a better understanding of your formative years. I'd like you to try to remember some of your earliest memories. It might help to write them down so you can keep track."}, {"instruction": "Uh, sure, Doc. I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doc. Here are the memories I came up with. You wanted early childhood, right? I tried to limit it to my earliest memories.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. I'll take a look at this later. That is a beautiful bouquet of flowers."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I think I have a secret admirer. Well, I do have a secret admirer. Look at these cards. That first one with the flower on it was on my desk when I got into work on the 31st. There was a daisy next to it. I didn't think too much of it until the next day. When I got back from lunch, that second card was on my desk--the one of the skyline--with a little Las Vegas skyline trinket.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Now, this one was the doozey. I got this one with the music on it last Friday and was totally confused. It looks weird, don't you think? I was feeling a bit creepy about all these notes, so I told our security chick, Brenda, about it. She thought it was just some kind of prank my co-workers might be playing on me. Evidently, she doesn't think we computer geeks are very mature.", "input": "", "output": "This one with the music does look a bit odd."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I played the violin for years. When I looked at it, I could tell that something was off, but I just couldn't figure it out. I was reading a book on Saturday and was using this card as a bookmark when I noticed something. The timing is 7/8, but it's not seven beats per measure like it should be. Besides, 7/8 is such a weird timing to use. It was the 7/8 timing that clued me in to the rest of it.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, look at this. Wait, let me explain a few things first. The timing tells the number of beats per measure. Each section of this--everything up to that vertical line--is called a measure. Inside each measure, the sum of the length of all the notes--the length of a note is the duration it is played--must equal the number of beats per measure stated in your time signature. This piece of music says that there should be seven beats per measure.", "input": "", "output": "But these notes don't measure up to seven beats in each measure?"}, {"instruction": "Nope. Now, each note has a numerical value that tells you how long or short the note is. The most commonly used time signature is 4/4. That means there are four beats per measure, and the measure is divided into four equal beats: one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four. This first note is called a quarter note because in 4/4 time it's equal to one quarter of the measure. The values change numerically based on the time signature. Follow me so far?", "input": "", "output": "I think I follow you."}, {"instruction": "Now for this, we'll pretend that doesn't happen. Even if you change the note values to compensate for the 7/8 time, it still doesn't equal the correct number of beats per measure. Did you get that?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I believe so."}, {"instruction": "Okay. This second note is the sixteenth note--one quarter of a quarter note is a sixteenth note. You can tell it's a sixteenth note because of its two little tails. For each additional tail, you square the value or something, so it goes: quarter note, eighth note, sixteenth note, thirty-second note, and so on. These next two notes are also sixteenth notes. They are played consecutively because they are hooked together by the bar on top.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Now, if this was real music, all three of those sixteenth notes would have been hooked together by a bar.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "I'll get to that in a second. So based on all of this, you can plainly see that in the first measure we have one quarter note and three sixteenth notes. The quarter note is one beat, the sixteenth notes are a quarter of a beat each. If you played this you'd have dum, du-du-du. Long, short-short-short.", "input": "", "output": "I think I'm with you."}, {"instruction": "So if you add up a quarter note and three sixteenth notes, you get one-and-three-quarters beats. I think that's right.", "input": "", "output": "One beat for the quarter note, and a quarter of a beat for each of the sixteenth notes."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I'm not good at articulating the math. But I can read it, and it's nowhere near the seven beats it's supposed to be.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "The longer I thought about it, the more perplexed I became. And I was really bugged about the three sixteenths notes not being hooked together. I just couldn't figure it out.", "input": "", "output": "Is this important, Olivia? We've spent almost half a session analyzing this note."}, {"instruction": "Indulge me, Doctor. So let's continue. Each note also has a name. A letter that represents it and the location of the note on the scale tells you its name. So I wrote out all the notes: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. There are sharps and flats as well that slightly modify the sound. But they aren't used here, so I won't explain them.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "So in this note, the letters for the first measure are B, B, C, C. The second measure reads G, A, E, D. The third measure is E, F, B, B, C, C, G, A, E, D, E, F. I tried rearranging these letters all sorts of ways, but couldn't come up with anything that made sense. Then I did this. Take a look.", "input": "", "output": "What is it?"}, {"instruction": "I made a table of the alphabet based on the letters used in music. Now, you see that first note? It's a quarter note--one beat--on the B line. The second note is a sixteenth note--it's a quarter of the length of the quarter note and has two little flags--and is on the B line as well.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Well, if you look at my chart, the second line under the B is the letter I.", "input": "", "output": "So it is."}, {"instruction": "So far, we have B, I. This next one had me confused. It's two eighth notes on the C line. B, I, C, C? Nope! It's an X. See? Two sixteenth notes--two notes together each having two little flags--equal four!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Four under the letter C is an X. If you do the rest of it, it reads BIX GOLD ST. I looked in the phone book and found that there is a restaurant on Gold Street called Bix!", "input": "", "output": "I'm amazed."}, {"instruction": "Someone took the time to make up this code, and I figured it out. It's great!", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "Well, an invitation is no good without a date and time. 7/8 is too obvious for a date and is too far away. I think it means the time--between seven and eight o'clock. Of course, I'm assuming PM.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds reasonable."}, {"instruction": "I was stumped on the date, until I got this last card on my chair this morning with these flowers: \"Will I gaze into your eyes tonight over a glass of wine?\" It is romantic enough to be unassuming if I didn't figure out the code. But it also gives me the date of the invitation if I did figure out the code.", "input": "", "output": "Do you have any idea who might be sending you these cards?"}, {"instruction": "None whatsoever. I'm at a complete loss for ideas. I can hardly wait for seven o'clock to come!", "input": "", "output": "Do you think it's okay to meet this mystery person alone?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'll be safe, Doc. I've asked Caren to come with me. I told her that I'd treat her and her husband to dinner at the restaurant even if no one shows up to meet me. I wouldn't dare meet someone like this without a backup. I'll have them in the restaurant with me, and they'll get a free dinner.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds good. You have your bases covered. What will you do if this secret admirer is someone you don't care to have as an admirer?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm, good question. What if it's that gross guy, Gary Hindle, in accounting? Phew! He's all sweaty and nasty. I'll have to work out a signal with Caren. If I give her the signal, she'll pretend to come running in and will whisk me away on some emergency. Or maybe she can call me from her cell phone and I can make my excuses and leave. That sounds like a good idea, too. Speaking of Caren, do you know her, Doc? I know you can't say whether or not she's a patient, so let me rephrase: I think Caren knows you.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I was telling her about last week's session, and she asked who was my therapist. When I said your name, she just kind of blinked at me and gave me a blank stare. Then we picked up the conversation and chit chatted away about other stuff. I got the impression that she might know you.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Well, anyway, I wanted to talk to you about my memories for a little bit, Doc. I don't want to run out of time, so can we change the subject?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "I had to do a lot of concentrating to come up with some of those early memories. Every time I remembered something, I tried to make myself remember something before that event. The memories are about the car accident, falling into the hole in the hill, swinging on the vines, and...I don't know who are the people in these memories. Should I?", "input": "", "output": "Are they familiar to you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I guess so. I feel like I should know who they are, but I can't remember. I can't remember faces, just that they were there.", "input": "", "output": "That's not uncommon. You were very young during these events."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I guess worrying about it won't make me remember. It's really not a big deal. I'll ask my father about them, he was there for one of those memories. Maybe he'll remember.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a good idea. On that note, why don't we wrap up for the afternoon."}, {"instruction": "Time sure does fly.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you for the music lesson, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Hey, no problem, Doc! See you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Be careful this evening. Have a good time."}, {"instruction": "See you, Doc!", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Who was that gentleman in the waiting room with you?"}, {"instruction": "The Big Kahuna, the grand daddy of them all--my father.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "When he's determined about something, there's no stopping him.", "input": "", "output": "What's going on, Olivia?"}, {"instruction": "He is going to shanghai me into talking to his attorney this evening. He wants me to give an affadivit about what happened on the night of the attack.", "input": "", "output": "And are you reluctant to do so?"}, {"instruction": "That's an understatement! It's odd. After the attack, I would have done almost anything to see those punks face justice. But I'm over it now, totally over it. I just want to go on with my life, such that it is, and put it all in the past. But my father keeps dredging it up and wants me to tell him all the details. He even hired someone to do a background check on Steffy. He said he doesn't want any \"surprises\" to come out in court, if this ever makes it to a courtroom.", "input": "", "output": "He does sound very determined."}, {"instruction": "And, Doctor, I owe you an apology. You were right. I went totally bananas on you, and there was no call for it. You were so right. Steffy is a...um, lesbian and...uh, she does...um, I mean...she is interested in...", "input": "", "output": "She is interested in more than just a platonic relationship with you?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, yeah.", "input": "", "output": "How did all of this come out?"}, {"instruction": "My father showed me his findings on Steffy. Here's a page of it. I was only able to get this last page, but it's enough to give you an idea of what's in the rest of the report.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure what he expected me to say when he showed this to me. He was probably relieved to read that \"currently living without a companion\" part. Anyway, I went over to Steffy's place the night my father showed this to me. I wanted to hear it from her--I asked her if she was a lesbian.", "input": "", "output": "Which she confirmed?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. She hugged me tight and told me that she'd been afraid to tell me. She was afraid that I'd treat her differently or stop being her friend. She said that when she \"came out\" to her parents, they refused to continue to pay for her school. She was devastated. Ever since, she's been very cautious about telling people about her sexuality.", "input": "", "output": "Mmm hmm."}, {"instruction": "That club we went to for drinks, Club Universe, it's a gay club. I feel so stupid. I had no idea. I guess I was the victim of gay bashing and didn't even know it.", "input": "", "output": "How does that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I was kind of angry at first. But then I just felt sorry for the guys that did this. I just can't imagine having so much hatred pent-up inside.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell Stephanie that your father had her investigated?"}, {"instruction": "No, I was too embarrassed that he'd do such a thing. It really is an invasion of privacy.", "input": "", "output": "She didn't question why you were suddenly enlightened regarding her sexuality?"}, {"instruction": "I was slick about it, Doc, I didn't just blurt it out. I just steered the conversation in the direction I wanted. We talked for a long time. I even asked her what made her realize that she wanted to love women and not men. I was impressed with her answer. She said that it wasn't like one day she woke up and was suddenly attracted to women.", "input": "", "output": "Self-realization is usually a slow, ongoing process for most people."}, {"instruction": "She said that she had always been curious about other women's bodies. Whenever she would go scooping for cute guys, she'd also see women that she thought were particularly hot. The more she thought about it, the more she realized that it wasn't the equipment that stirred her soul, but the person.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I thought that was a good way to look at life. Too often, people become distracted by physical characteristics and fail to see who that person really is. While physical attraction is important, I think that many people find that the more they get to know someone, the more attractive that person becomes.", "input": "", "output": "That's very observant, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Well, all of this has made me start looking at my life. Look at me. I live in a house my father bought for me. I pay him a paltry sum each month for rent. I got my start in the industry working for daddy's company. I have almost no friends. I have no social life. I've never had a real relationship. Doctor Balis, I'm a virgin! I'm a twenty-five...almost twenty-six year old virgin. That is pitiful.", "input": "", "output": "The tissues are on the table beside you."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. It's just that...well, here's this woman who knows herself. She's confident with who she is and with her place in the world. She has faced adversity and has even been outcast from her family. And then there's me--a sniveling little daddy's girl. When Steffy was telling me about her decision to come out to her parents, I could see the determination and strength in her eyes. I could never tell my father something like that. I feel like he has me on this pedestal like a trophy, and as long as I'm dressed in petticoats and lace with every hair perfectly in place...well...he would only accept me that way. But I'm tired of being on this damn pedestal.", "input": "", "output": "Your father obviously loves you, Olivia. When you first came here, you were in the process of distancing yourself from your father, and I believe that you've made some progress."}, {"instruction": "I suppose I have. I don't work for him anymore, and I don't live with him anymore. But what did I do at the first sign of trouble? I ran right back to him. Remember when I tried to stay at my father's house because I didn't want to be alone in my own house?", "input": "", "output": "It's only natural to want to feel safe and protected after a trauma. You know that your father will always protect you and that you will be safe with him. Don't discount that as weakness, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "I just want to feel that I can rely on myself for what I need and to know that I won't always be running back to my father for some...for whatever comes up. I don't want to talk about this anymore, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, we can drop it for now. What else is on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the mystery of the secret admirer has not been solved.", "input": "", "output": "Your blind date was a no-show?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And I felt pretty stupid for showing up. At least Caren and her husband had a nice evening out. I left before they did, but I gave their waitress my charge number and told her to call me when they were ready to go. No big deal.", "input": "", "output": "Was there anyone else in the restaurant that you recognized?"}, {"instruction": "Nope. I kept looking around to see if I could recognize someone from work, but I didn't see anyone though. It's kind of creepy when you think about it. Someone went to all that trouble to make all those cards and then didn't even show up. Oh, I almost forgot. Steffy might have to put Chain Saw to sleep.", "input": "", "output": "Her Rottweiler?"}, {"instruction": "Uh huh. He bit some kid. I told Steffy that Chain Saw was a lawsuit waiting to happen, but she didn't listen.", "input": "", "output": "I hope the child wasn't seriously injured."}, {"instruction": "So does Steffy. Not only will they make her put her dog to sleep, but she could end up with criminal charges brought against her, not to mention a hefty lawsuit. I think it happened over the weekend. She was really late getting in to work this morning because she was on the phone for so long with her landlord. If her landlord's insurance company finds out about the bite, they might drop the policy. If this kid's parents decide to sue, the insurance company would be paying.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a bad situation."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I don't envy Steffy. We didn't have a lot of time to talk about it at work, but she said she'd fill me in on all the details tonight. She asked me to go with her to the animal shelter to see Chain Saw. But now that my father has decided to plan my evening for me, I can scratch the visit to Poochie-Ville off my list for tonight.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Well, our time is up. But before you leave, I want to say a few things."}, {"instruction": "Um, okay.", "input": "", "output": "You probably feel a lot of internal pressure to have sex just to lose your virginity.  But I respect you for not lowering your standards just to lose it.  Your desire to find the right person to share yourself with is admirable. It's not something to be ashamed of. One last thing before you head out..."}, {"instruction": "Yes?", "input": "", "output": "Do what you want, Olivia. If you don't want to go forward with a civil suit against your attackers, you don't have to do so. Just keep in mind that this decision is yours."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I will. Thanks, Doc. Uh, would a hug desecrate any doctor/patient ethics?", "input": "", "output": "In this context, I think it's quite permissible."}, {"instruction": "See you next week, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye and good luck this evening, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Happy birthday!"}, {"instruction": "Why, thank you, Doc! You remembered.", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "I know--it's in my files. Oh, sorry about last week.  With this new product announcement, I had more than my usual load to deal with at work.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay.  I hope you had a chance to celebrate your birthday."}, {"instruction": "My father and I went out to dinner. Aside from that, my birthday was just another quiet evening at home with Sherman.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds very nice, actually."}, {"instruction": "It was.", "input": "", "output": "How did things go with your father and his attorney?"}, {"instruction": "Pretty well. I stood my ground and explained to them why I did not want to go ahead with a lawsuit. Mr. Bergen was pretty pushy about it, but my father called him off when I burst into tears. I just cried and cried. I kept trying to make them understand that a lawsuit wouldn't help me get over this or feel any better about what happened. I think my father finally heard me...I mean really heard what I was saying when it was through tears.", "input": "", "output": "Mm-hmm. Where did things go from there?"}, {"instruction": "My father asked Mr. Bergen to give us a few minutes to talk. After Mr. Bergen left, my father asked me why I hadn't told him this sooner. I was absolutely floored. How on earth could he not realize that I did not want to do this? It's not like that was the first time I'd voiced my opinion on the subject. Jeez! How long have I been telling him that I don't want to talk to reporters and that I don't want to deal with the State Department? I don't want to file a civil lawsuit period! Great Gertie-Schmertie! How many times do I have to tell him? So there I was sniffing, dripping, and whining. I'm sure Mr. Bergen thought I was a nut-case.", "input": "", "output": "It's good that your father finally understood your feelings about this, Olivia, even if it did take a while."}, {"instruction": "Well, there's no doubt now. He was a bit peeved because they had done a lot of preliminary work and it all went down the drain now. After that, we left Mr. Bergen's office and headed over to my house for a long talk.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "By the time we got there, I was furious about everything. I said some pretty harsh things to him. I pretty much let off a lot of steam that had been building up.", "input": "", "output": "What did you tell him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we started with the attack. His eyes teared up when I told him how much he hurt me the night I told him about the attack. He was really confused, so I spelled it out to him. When he realized that he totally blew off how I felt about the attack and my emotions so that he could go for blood and track down the attackers, he had to sit down and close his eyes for a while. I told him that when he did that, he made me feel like a tarnished trophy. And I told him that it felt like his only concern was getting retribution from the person who damaged his possession.", "input": "", "output": "What was his reaction?"}, {"instruction": "He said he was sorry and held me tight for a while. He tried to explain, but said that there was no way to justify his behavior.", "input": "", "output": "Did his remorse help you feel better?"}, {"instruction": "Not at the time. I was too caught up in telling him about all his faults. Upon reflection, it did help to know that he realized how he had hurt me.", "input": "", "output": "Did you continue talking after that?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I launched into what I call my Trophy Complex.", "input": "", "output": "Trophy Complex?"}, {"instruction": "Trophy Complex is all about being that perfect daughter on a pedestal. It is always knowing that Daddy will be there to pad each step I take and to make sure the world is perfect for me. It's being afraid to live my life and do the things I want to do for fear of his disapproval. It's always wondering if my life measures up to his expectations of me. Oh, drat! Do you have more tissues, Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Here you go. It seems that you were able to vent a lot that night. How did your father respond?"}, {"instruction": "At first, he was angry and told me that he did not raise me to speak to him in such a disrespectful way. So I...um, I stuck my tongue out at him.", "input": "", "output": "Quite mature, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I know. It still makes me laugh when I think about it. Don't bother to try hiding your smile, Doc. It's pretty funny when you think about it. My poor father just blinked a few times. Then I just burst out laughing! He stared at me for a few moments longer, and then he laughed a little, too. Then he suggested that I lay down for a while and that we would discuss all this later when I wasn't so weary. And I told him to quit patronizing me and to treat me like an adult. I swear, Doc, I thought he was going to have a heart attack!", "input": "", "output": "Is that your pager, Olivia?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Oh, wow! It's Jordan. He's in town and wants to meet me for drinks and dinner. Doctor, I know we have a lot to discuss, but can I leave early please? See?  I can get messages on my pager.  I didn't know he was going to choose an address across town--this is in the outer Sunset.  I need to leave now, if I want to meet him on time.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Go ahead, Olivia. Have a good evening."}, {"instruction": "Thanks a million, Doctor Balis! Thank you, thank you, thank you, and thank you!", "input": "", "output": "Olivia, I'm glad you and your father had that talk. I'm looking forward to hearing more about it next week. Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hi there, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "You seem pleased today, Olivia. You're grinning from ear to ear."}, {"instruction": "Well, Doc, things are really starting to shape up.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "I'll start with the good news and move up to the great news. How does that sound?", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a good place to start."}, {"instruction": "Well, Steffy won't be sued by the parents of the kid that Chain Saw bit. The little boy had a few small scratches and was a bit shaken up, but no serious damage was done. The parents called Steffy at work today to let her know that they would not be pursuing the matter further.", "input": "", "output": "That is good news for Steffy. What happens to her dog now?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Steffy had him temperament tested over the weekend. Temperament testing is really neat. Someone interacts with the dog in a variety of circumstances, and based on the dog's responses, they can evaluate how aggressive or submissive the dog is. Well, Chain Saw is definitely an aggressive dog. The animal behaviorist said that unless Steffy is willing to put a lot of time and work into fixing Chain Saw's aggression problems, she should put him down.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, bummer. But it would probably be the best thing. They told her that they can't guarantee that he can ever be considered a \"sound\" dog or that they would be able to correct all of his aggression issues. They also warned her that sometimes, the trauma a dog endures at an early age can never be erased. She will probably end up putting him to sleep. The good part in all of this is that the child was not seriously hurt.", "input": "", "output": "I agree."}, {"instruction": "Steffy is upset about all of this--the bite, the possibly of a legal action, her landlord bearing down on her, and now having to decide whether or not to put Chain Saw to sleep. She was really starting to depend on Chain Saw as a kind of security blanket. She realizes that she needs to do what is best for the greatest number of people--she needs to put him to sleep. I think that she'll probably get another dog. Hopefully, she'll be a bit more judicious about finding the right dog for herself. Anyway...", "input": "", "output": "What's the other good news?"}, {"instruction": "I found out who sent all those notes to me!", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "A drum roll please! It was the butler in the kitchen with the candlestick. Just kidding. Brad sent them to me!", "input": "", "output": "Isn't Brad the cross-dresser in your group?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. And he's gay on top of that. I was so shocked.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "I was confused, too. I thought it was a prank at first, that he was just jerking my chain. Then I thought that he was considering...uh, changing teams. He said that he admires my spunkiness and my friendship and that he wanted to find a way to make me feel special. So he sent me the notes and flowers. And get this: he was there at Bix that night. He was in full drag and looked so good that I didn't even see him. He planned to wait and see if I recognized him. If I didn't, he'd approach me and drag me back to his table. Unfortunately, I left just as he decided that I wasn't going to be able to recognize him--our timing was off.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, he's a sweetie. And speaking of sweethearts, my father has a girlfriend. Can you believe it? He told me last Tuesday when we went out to dinner for my birthday. I totally forgot to tell you about it last week. My father is seeing some chick he met at a business conference. Her name is Kelly, and she sounds really nice. He even boasted that he found this one without any help from me. He has been dating Kelly since December. He thinks she might be a \"keeper.\"", "input": "", "output": "Did that surprise you?"}, {"instruction": "At first, it did. Then I was a little irritated that he didn't tell me about her sooner. But after I thought about it, I realized that he needs to have his life just as much as I need to have mine. The three of us will probably go out this coming weekend. It should be fun. Now for the second best news...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "The lawsuit has been officially terminated. Talk about a load off my mind. My father even personally called all the reporters and told them that the story was dead. He also contacted the State Department and told them that we wouldn't be pursuing a civil suit but he hoped that they would act on his official complaint. Looking back, I'm glad that my father made the complaint to the State Department. I think they should be aware of problems even if diplomatic immunity prevents any criminal prosecution.", "input": "", "output": "Did he bring all of this to a close because of your conversation with him or for some other reasons?"}, {"instruction": "I asked him that, too. He said that he couldn't continue with this if it was hurting me. He felt pretty bad about being so caught up in seeking vengeance that he overlooked what I was going through. I really do believe that he felt that he was doing the right thing for me. It took a lot to get through to him, but in the end, he heard what I was telling him and immediately did what was necessary to make things right with me.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "And the big news, the biggest news of all is sad news, too.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I think my therapy is over, Doc. I originally came here to figure out that creep Jonas, but that's over. And I'm over my attack. So I think it's safe to release me back into society.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "You don't sound too convinced. What's wrong?", "input": "", "output": "There is nothing wrong. I think you're an outgoing, loving person, and basically pretty capable of taking care of yourself."}, {"instruction": "But?", "input": "", "output": "But I also believe that you still have a few issues that we haven't fully explored and that need work. I'd like to help you with them. But the decision to continue or discontinue therapy is certainly yours, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Doc, I'm not a psychopath. I think I'm a pretty well adjusted person. I do like being able to have a sounding board, though. I think you help keep me on track and help keep me focused, you know? Why don't we try this. Let's change the sessions to every other week and see how that works. This way, I could gradually quit.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "I think that's wise. And for your next session, I'd like to you formulate a list of areas that you think you need to work on. I think it would help us both to have an agenda and a goal."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I can do that. So, our next appointment will be....", "input": "", "output": "Monday, May 18th."}, {"instruction": "Okay, great. I'll see you then, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Olivia. Have a good week."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doc. Isn't it gorgeous today? Just a few clouds but no rain. I just might try to do some gardening when I get home today. I'd like to have things all nice and tidy before I go on vacation.", "input": "", "output": "Vacation? Where are you going?"}, {"instruction": "I'm going to head to the East Coast for a week. Steffy was supposed to go to Washington, D.C. last month for some meeting, but it was postponed. They've rescheduled it for this week. I'll be tagging along with Steffy. It'll be nice to do some sightseeing while she's in her meetings.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds good."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it should be fun. We've been collecting brochures for all the cheesy amusement parks and theme parks we can find in the area. We don't want to limit ourselves to D.C. only.", "input": "", "output": "You might want to visit Luray Caverns. The stalagmites and stalactites are breathtaking."}, {"instruction": "Ooh! Thanks for the tip. I haven't told my father that I'll be going to the East Coast yet. I'm not sure how he'd take it considering that...well, considering everything that happened there.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Birth, adoption. And with that nice segue, I put together my thoughts on issues that I need help with and my thoughts on them.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Why don't we get started then?"}, {"instruction": "Well, first on my list is that people don't seem to take me seriously. I'd like to try and figure out why people don't take me seriously. I want to see if maybe it's something that I do or say, and then I want to try to change that. Mostly, I feel like my father doesn't think I can do things on my own. When I tell him about projects I want to get involved in, he just kind of pats me on the head and sends me on my merry way.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that it's only your father who treats you this way or do other people do it as well?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm. It's mostly my father, but sometimes it's other people, too. When I was in college, people either thought I was stuck up or a complete ditz. But I can't help that I'm a bubbly person, can I?", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel that people treat you this way in professional circles?"}, {"instruction": "I feel pretty good about work. We all work well together and are able to joke around and still tackle the projects effectively. Vinnie lets me work on my own most of the time. I get the feeling that some of the executives are a bit snobby, but I don't think it's a reflection on me personally--it's just a superiority thing, I guess. It was different when I was working for my father in his company. There I really felt like a clod. But my father was the big boss, and people didn't want to give me the benefit of the doubt.", "input": "", "output": "I agree working for SII seems to have improved your sense of self-assurance."}, {"instruction": "Do you think? I'm sure it has on some levels. I do have more confidence in my ideas, and I definitely have more conviction when I feel that I'm right about an issue. I think that comes from increased skills as well as a new environment. I've learned a lot about project management, time and task management, organization, and prioritizing work since I started working for Vinnie.", "input": "", "output": "What about family, Olivia? You seem to focus on work rather intently but rarely on your family unless it's unavoidable."}, {"instruction": "Well...I mean...I don't really have a family, Doc. My father and I aren't exactly the typical all-American family with two-point-five children, a dog, a cat, and a house with a white picket fence.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want that type of a family?"}, {"instruction": "Well, who wouldn't? I know that every family is dysfunctional to some degree or another. No one is perfect. But it would be nice to have a mother and a father. I think that if things had been different...well, things aren't different.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that it might be worthwhile to talk about your mother and the role she played in your life?"}, {"instruction": "Her role? She's dead, Doc. She doesn't have a role in my life.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "What? Whenever you give me that look, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that there's more to it. Well, there isn't. I'm not heartbroken. I'm not devastated. I'm not trying to find the meaning of anything. I'm not trying to resolve why she died. It's a fact, and I've accepted it. End of story!", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be expending a great deal of effort minimizing the impact your mother's death had on your life, Olivia. There's no need to feel defensive; my intent is not to attack you."}, {"instruction": "I know. It's just...uh. I don't really think about where I came from. It's just easier to deal with things as they come up, you know?", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "There you go again with that look. I swear! Can we please change the subject?", "input": "", "output": "I think that this is something we should talk about, Olivia. However, I'd like you to take some time over the next two weeks to really think about your mother. Are there aspects of your life that are affected by her rape and her death? Those were very traumatic events. And I believe they have left an impression on you. I'd like to know what you feel and think about this."}, {"instruction": "Not much more than what I've just told you. Okay, okay! I'll think about it. Can we go on now please?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. What else do you have on your agenda, Olivia?"}, {"instruction": "Um, I think my dating standards are too high. Or maybe I'm just destined to be an old maid. Maybe I should buy stock in a vibrator company. Oh my God! I can't believe I said that. Oh God. I'm so embarrassed.", "input": "", "output": "There's no reason to be embarrassed. Everyone has sexual feelings and desires."}, {"instruction": "Yes, but...well, that's just a very private thing for me. I...uh, I don't like to discuss things like that.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine. Let's go back to your original point. You said that you were feeling destined to be an old maid. You mentioned in another session that none of the young men you met were able to draw amorous feelings from you. But what about Jordan? How do you feel about him?"}, {"instruction": "Jordan is...he's like a dream. It's like he's not real or there's something wrong and I just haven't discovered it yet.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Sometimes, I think he's just too perfect. I like being around him and talking to him. We hold hands a lot and exchange soft kisses, but not much more than that. It's not that I'm looking to jump into bed with him right off the bat or anything, but...", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to develop a deeper relationship with him?"}, {"instruction": "I think I might. But I don't know. It's an awful lot of work to go through. And if it doesn't work out in the end...", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you are thinking of a relationship as an investment. Perhaps you should approach it as a learning experience. You can learn how to be vulnerable, how to give yourself to another.  You can also learn what you might want in a life-long partner. These are all very important things..."}, {"instruction": "I guess. I don't know. Maybe I'll be happy spending my life on my own with gentlemen friends from time to time like that one executive. What's her name? Katie or Cathy Lippen or something.", "input": "", "output": "We're almost out of time, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I think it would be a good idea to continue with therapy.", "input": "", "output": "I think so, too."}, {"instruction": "Can we keep it to every other week? Things are really busy at work.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine. I'll see you in two weeks. Have a good time on your trip, Olivia."}, {"instruction": "Hi, Doctor B!", "input": "", "output": "Good afternoon, Olivia. How was your trip?"}, {"instruction": "How was it? Well, it was definitely not an ordinary vacation. There were some tense moments, but all in all it was pretty good. I have a lot to tell you. But before we get into that, I have something for you. We were in the Smithsonian gift shop, and I saw this little inspirational plaque. I bought one for myself and one for you. I thought it might help lift the spirits of your other clients.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Olivia. It's very nice of you."}, {"instruction": "I like what it says: \"Get in a positive mind set; develop guiding principles; recite affirmations; set goals; and produce daily outcomes.\" I've sort of taken this on as my personal mantra. I put my plaque up on the wall in my bathroom so I can read it as I get ready for work in the morning. I thought that maybe someone else might enjoy it as well.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Olivia. I appreciate your gift."}, {"instruction": "Doc, I did something wild and crazy on my trip.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I got a tattoo. It's a little heart with a teardrop. Do you want to see it?", "input": "", "output": "Where is it?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, don't be a chicken, Doc! It's on my top rib, directly under my left breast. I can't wear a bra yet, but I promise not to flash you.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. What brought this on? Normally, you're pretty conservative."}, {"instruction": "Steffy got me drunk, and we were playing truth or dare. I chose dare. My dare was either kissing her for a full minute or getting a tattoo.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Well, at least it's small and inconspicuous. I'd hate to be an eighty-year-old woman with a Tweety Bird tattoo on my ankle.", "input": "", "output": "That would be a bit odd."}, {"instruction": "I did something else kind of crazy on my trip. I...um...well, I looked up my grandparents.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I was so scared, Doctor Balis. I really was. I spent a whole day trying to get up the courage to contact them. Steffy was totally against it. She said I was opening Pandora's box and that I wouldn't like what I found. I don't know, though.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm? Oh, I looked them up in the phone book. They never moved away, so it was easy to find them. When I called, I didn't tell them who I was. I just pretended to be taking a survey. Once I verified who they were, I was too shocked to say anything else and just hung up. I decided to put the ball in their court. I wrote a letter telling them who I am and that I'd like to meet them. I didn't get all mushy or anything. I was very matter-of-fact about it. I gave them the phone number and address of where I was staying, and the rest was up to them.", "input": "", "output": "Were you worried that they might not respond?"}, {"instruction": "Why wouldn't they? I'm their granddaughter. It's not like my mother died yesterday. This is twenty six years later. Why on Earth wouldn't they want to meet me? But to put your mind at ease, they did respond.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Thanks for being so supportive--I thought you'd be the one person who would encourage me in this. You needn't sound so incredulous. You kept telling me to think about my mother and explore those feelings. Well I am! Now my father is furious. Steffy thinks I'm making a huge mistake. And Jordan...well, Jordan thinks I'm only going to find sadness and pain.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not trying to be discouraging, Olivia. I just want to know what happened and how you feel about it."}, {"instruction": "It's just...this is so hard. It's so much harder than I thought it would be. I can't believe I'm crying over this.", "input": "", "output": "Here are some tissues."}, {"instruction": "I thought that meeting them would help fill an empty part in me. But it didn't. It just made it worse.", "input": "", "output": "I don't understand."}, {"instruction": "I thought it would be like walking into an instant family: Pick two grandparents, add one lonely girl, mix well, and voil\u00e0--instant family. But it's not that easy.", "input": "", "output": "It never is, Olivia. Relationships take time to develop. There is no such thing as an instant family. This is going to take a lot of work. By entering their lives, you have reminded your grandparents of the loss of their daughter."}, {"instruction": "But it's not my fault! It's not my fault that she was raped and got pregnant. It's not my fault that she had a nervous breakdown. It's not my fault...why do I have to pay for it?", "input": "", "output": "No, it's not your fault, Olivia. But I think there is a lot of guilt going around. I believe your grandparents feel guilt for leaving their daughter alone in the house when she got raped. You told me that your father felt enormous guilt for not being able to protect your mother from the rapist. He felt so much guilt that he married your mother and adopted you. So it is to be expected that there would be some difficulties in trying to restore your family. Don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "I guess. And they, my grandparents, got rid of me so they wouldn't have to deal with that guilt on a daily basis.", "input": "", "output": "It's possible."}, {"instruction": "They are going to have to deal with that guilt. I deserve to have a family. It may not be the picture perfect family, but I need more than just my father. I need to know who I am, I need to know my heritage. So I've decided to move out to the East Coast. You might want to pick your jaw up from the floor, Doc. I'm very serious about this. I can easily get a job as a contractor. I have money saved up to handle the move and immediate expenses.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And how do your grandparents feel about this?"}, {"instruction": "They aren't too keen on it, but they said they'd give it a try.", "input": "", "output": "And your father?"}, {"instruction": "He hugged me for a long time, and we cried together. He said that he doesn't want me to go because he'll miss me, but he understands why I need to do this. He offered to call some friends out there to help me get a job, but I told him that I want to do this on my own. I really want to do this on my own.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "This will be a chance for me to make it completely on your own.", "input": "", "output": "Are you scared?"}, {"instruction": "I'm scared shitless, Doc. Oops! Sorry, didn't mean to cuss. This is my chance to make it or break it. Moving to another big city won't be too difficult, but it will be lonely. I'll have to rely on my grandparents for help with some things, like where the good neighborhoods are and where the red-light areas are. I'd hate to end up living next door to Marion Barry's crack dealer. He was sent to jail on possession charges, you know.", "input": "", "output": "I've heard some of the stories about the mayor of D.C."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and they reelected him when he got out of jail. Amazing! Anyway, I wanted to thank you for putting up with me and my neurosis and quirkiness. I know that's what you get paid to do, but I think you did it because you really cared about me.", "input": "", "output": "I do care, Olivia. I'm glad that I've been able to help you. Please e-mail me at some point and let me know how you are doing. I'd be happy to provide you with some references for good therapists out in the D.C. area, if you would like."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis. I'd really appreciate that. I'm not sure what I'll be able to afford when I get there, but I'll definitely keep in touch. I don't want to make this a permanent move, but who knows?", "input": "", "output": "Good luck, Olivia. I wish you the best."}]
