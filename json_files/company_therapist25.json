I was going to be a writer. We loved each other\nand were broke as hell. Salad days, don't they call it? Margaret was like\na different girl back then. I wrote adventure stuff and westerns. She loved\nthem. She was going to be a lawyer, was going to San Francisco State, taking\nclasses and babysitting at night to earn some cash. I think it was the\nbabysitting stuff that started it, but maybe every woman gets her hormones\ntriggered. Margaret loved those kids, they were about 2 when she started.\nAnd she decided that she just had to have some, you know?

I got a job\nwriting technical manuals--you know, put this disk in the slot and press\nthe button type of writing.

You\nwrote Westerns, how about trying science fiction, or romance. Try writing\nin a new genre. It will be harder to compare it to your previous stuff.\nAnd I would try automatic writing--just let it flow, there's plenty of time\nto edit it later. Don't even read what you've already written.

I remember that I picked up the violin\nwhen I was a kid. I couldn't play it all and I had no ear, so I'm sure it\nwas hard to listen to me practice. But all my parents did was make fun of\nme. It wasn't like they sat there and pointed and laughed. They weren't\ntrying to be cruel.

We first talked about four sessions and then an evaluation.  I would still like to stick to that plan."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well...I went back to try to write some stuff without being so critical. It works.  You can really write a substantial chunk of material and then go back and hack it to bits, but still be left with something.  It's much better than just writing a paragraph and then crossing it out.", "input": "", "output": "Did you change the genre that you're writing in?"}, {"instruction": "No, I decided to stick with Westerns.

I've never had an affair before, and I'm terrified that my wife is going to find out.  Every time I touch her, I worry about her being able to sense that something is wrong, that I'm different somehow.  I look into her eyes and when she looks back searchingly, I think that she must be able to see something, so I look away guiltily.  Then I realize what I've done and feel that I've made it worse, so I look at her again to see whether she noticed.  Frankly, it wasn't worth it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And then it's my boss, too.  When I'm at work, I get to worry about whether the other people in my department know.

Actually, I can't believe this is something that I did.  Of course I've thought about sleeping around before.  I've been married, what, seventeen years?  I drive home and sometimes go through the Tenderloin.  On some corners, the hookers are three and four at a time.  A lot of them look like they're really guys, you know?  But occasionally I'll see one that will just make an electric shock go through me.  You know, that feeling where your toes curl.  There's something about knowing that a girl will sleep with you for fifty bucks or something.  You have to understand that I love my wife very much.  But I had to give up so much to get her--what with the kids and all the responsibility and everything.  But you could pay fifty bucks to one of these girls...well, I've thought about it, anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Have you acted on it?"}, {"instruction": "No, of course not!  I'm talking about fantasy here, Doctor.  I'm not saying that I'd do something.  I'd probably catch something.  I mean those girls are turning trick after trick after trick.  They probably see more action with different people in a night than I have in my whole life.  So, I'm just talking.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you bring them up?"}, {"instruction": "I was just saying that I'd thought about having affairs before.  Every guy has, I bet.  But I wasn't going to do anything about it.  But then I'm working late one night, real late actually.  I guess it's about ten thirty or eleven.  Well, my boss turns human.  She's always been good looking, but she's kind of hard, you know?  I'm sure it's difficult for a woman executive and all that, so there's some overcompensation, I figure.  I never held it against her.  There's guys that talk about ball busting and stuff, but she's always been fair, just tough.  She's not the kind of boss that you'd feel comfortable asking out for a beer or asking for a raise either, for that matter.  But she's always willing to pass out the praise when there is any.  In any case, it was late and she asked me if I wanted to get some coffee or something.  I figured sure, you know.  Get a piece of pie or something.  So we head over to this diner.  And we start to talk, just like two humans, you know.  Not like she was my boss.  And she's interested in my writing.  Well, after coming here I've been writing again--thank you very much.  So I'm sort of enthusiastic about talking about fiction and my westerns.  And she's really interested.  I could tell that she wasn't just pasting a smile on for my benefit.  She was really interested in what I was saying.  So I told her the story I'm working on and she liked it.  So I told her some of the old stories and she really liked them.  Her eyes were sparkling and she was paying attention--asking really good questions that revealed different aspects of the characters, stuff like that.  It was definitely cool to have somebody interested in my work again.  And for it to be my boss...I guess I was flattered.  Sure I was, more than a guess.  I was thinking that this was going to mean a promotion or something.", "input": "", "output": "You were thinking about how this was going to affect you professionally?"}, {"instruction": "No, no, that's not it.   Well, maybe a little, but that isn't what it was like.  We were really connecting as people, you know?  If that made her think of me as more valuable too, that was great.

I shouldn't have interrupted you."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm just trying to say that I wasn't looking to have an affair or something.  I'm not virgin pure, you understand.  I have thoughts and fantasies too.  But I'd never slept with a woman since I got married.  Actually, about five years ago, I was on some sort of business trip and I met this woman in the airplane.  We got to talking and by the end of the trip, we were necking.  It was really exciting.  But I kept on trying to get her to come with me to the bathroom and she wouldn't do it.  And somehow she avoided actually coming up with her phone number, so I never saw her again.  That was as close as I ever came before.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you would have had sex with her if she had agreed to go back with you to the bathroom?"}, {"instruction": "Being honest?  I think there's no question I would have done it.  I mean I don't get those kind of opportunities every day and it really doesn't have anything to do with my wife.  This girl wasn't even particularly attractive, actually.  Just easy.  I was on a trip and free for a while and I would have slept with her if she'd let me.  But she didn't, so I was true to my marriage.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have problems facing your wife when you got back from that business trip?"}, {"instruction": "You mean problems because I kissed that girl?  No, of course not!  That wasn't real.  I don't know how to put it, but that didn't cross the line, you know?  I mean, coming home last Wednesday night, I had to wash my dick in the sink and worry about whether it smelled like my boss.  That definitely crossed the line.", "input": "", "output": "So how did it happen with Sylvia?"}, {"instruction": "Whoa!  How did you know her name was Sylvia?!", "input": "", "output": "You must have mentioned it."}, {"instruction": "I did not!  I've been really careful not to use her name.", "input": "", "output": "Well, you described her as your boss and you must have mentioned her in a previous session."}, {"instruction": "I doubt that, actually.  To tell you the truth, she hasn't been a very important figure in my life up to now.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I also have a personnel chart of SII.  I've looked it over and seen who heads each of the departments.  I must have just put two and two together."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "You were talking about how the event occurred?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well...it was nice talking to someone who cared about what I was doing, and who understood some of the technical issues that I deal with.  That's different than my wife too, who doesn't understand and doesn't give a shit.  She's just not going to work to understand some technical issues about what I'm doing.  She's all \"That's nice, Dear\" but she's not really interested.  But Sylvia understands the technical issues and was interested in my fiction writing.  So when she asked me if I wanted a lift home...it must have been midnight, now.  When she asked, I asked her if we could go the scenic route.  So we kept talking and wound up on Twin Peaks.  There's a scenic lookout there and if you park in just the right space, you can look directly down Market Street, with the Castro district in front and the Ferry Building at the far end.  It was all lit up and really nice, so I asked her if I could kiss her.  I just came out with it, just like that.  It felt like the bravest thing I'd ever done, but of course she was giving me plenty of signals.  From there on, it was really easy.  She was very accommodating, even when she had to sit with the steering wheel pressed into her back.  About forty minutes later, I was washing my dick in the sink.", "input": "", "output": "How has your relationship been with your wife?"}, {"instruction": "Do you mean before or after this?", "input": "", "output": "You haven't told her.

I don't think she suspects exactly, except that I'm acting so weird.", "input": "", "output": "That's the furtive looks you were talking about?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, and it's like my style of making love has changed somehow.  I mean we develop a pattern--maybe more like a rut--in the way that we make love.  It's familiar and comfortable.  But Sylvia's disrupted the pattern for me.  Now, I move wrong or something.  It just seems different.", "input": "", "output": "Your wife would be very upset if she found out the truth?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, Jeez.  She just can't.  I really blew it.  I mean we really love each other and always have.  This is the kind of thing that would totally shatter it for her.  She'd question every tenet of our marriage, my love, her love, whether we should stay together, the nature of truth and betrayal...all that stuff.  It would really fuck up everything.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, we're out of time Hal.  Let me see you again next Monday at 10 am and we can talk this thing through.  I'm sure that we can figure out appropriate next steps.  But my advice to you is don't repeat the affair.  Follow Sylvia's lead and pretend like it never happened at work.

I was just doing what I told you--waiting until the holidays are over and then...well you know.", "input": "", "output": "But the holidays were over almost a month ago."}, {"instruction": "I've run into a bit of a snag--it seems that Sylvia had some sort of pregnancy problem and had to take off from work for awhile.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I tried getting in touch with her, but I could only leave a voice or e-mail message.  And, as you can imagine, this is the type of conversation that should be handled just right.  I was hoping to speak with her in person.  I want to do it right--get on my knees and that sort of thing.  She deserves it.", "input": "", "output": "So you haven't been able to talk with Ms. Bows in person all this time?"}, {"instruction": "You'd think that since I work directly under her it'd be easy!", "input": "", "output": "But she's been sick."}, {"instruction": "I guess.  But the fact remains that I have no access to her right now.  And I feel that time is running out and I just can't wait that much longer.", "input": "", "output": "So how do you think I can help, Hal?"}, {"instruction": "I've been thinking.  You're a company Doctor and all and probably have access to all that personal information that they keep on file about us somewhere, right?", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "You know, the medical stuff and insurance records...", "input": "", "output": "Hal..."}, {"instruction": "Wait Doc, hear me out.  I had this plan, you see, the next time they were going to messenger office stuff over to her, I was going to volunteer and bring it over to her house myself.  I'd be a good Samaritan at work and what could be more natural, right?", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "So I started to come in to the office every day for the last two week and nothing.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean nothing?"}, {"instruction": "I mean no more messengers, no more packages, no more anything.  Zip.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "And it's not like our department has nothing going on right now either.  We're swamped.  But she is getting nothing and, what's more, no one has heard from her in awhile.  Official word is that she is too sick to deal.  But I don't think so.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "I've been around.  I know how it is when someone is getting ousted.", "input": "", "output": "You think that Sylvia is being fired?"}, {"instruction": "It all points to that.  First, Lloyd made this big deal about how Sylvia is going to continue running the operation but from her house.  They even got a couple of guys going over there and setting things up.  But a couple of weeks go by and she stops responding to messages.  And I know her--that woman is driven.  There is no way that she would voluntarily give up all her power like that.  And then we get this memo that this guy, Nils Landors, from Advertising and Presentations is going to take over her job.  But only for a while of course.", "input": "", "output": "Advertising and Presentations?"}, {"instruction": "I thought it was strange too.  Except he is Lloyd's buddy and he's been having these conversations with everyone in our department.", "input": "", "output": "What conversations?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he called me in, closed the door, and started asking questions about Ms. Bows:  Was she a good manager?  Did she know what she was doing?  Did I know anything that they should know?  At first I thought that they knew about her and me and were just playing a sick game.  I was waiting for him to ask if the baby was mine.  But he let me go when I proved to be quite useless and stupid in answering his questions.  Then I asked around the office and he'd been questioning everybody.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think he wants?"}, {"instruction": "My bet is that Lloyd is figuring out a way to fire her and he got his buddy in to dig up some dirt just in case she sues or something.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "But for me Doc, I feel like my time is running out.  She'll be history and I'll blow my last chance for happiness.", "input": "", "output": "I would like to talk to you about that, Hal."}, {"instruction": "Doc, I don't need a lecture in morality.  I know what my responsibilities are.  I'll take care of my wife and kids.  With Sylvia's money, I'd even be able to do a decent job of it.  And with losing the job and the new baby--my baby--on the way, Sylvia needs all the emotional support she can get.  And I'm right here, ready to give it to her.", "input": "", "output": "What about your wife?"}, {"instruction": "She has her career.  That's all she ever wanted anyway.  Look, I'm not asking for a lot.  Just her address and private phone number--a way to reach her.  I've been beating my head against the wall for the last two weeks.  All you need to do is just take a quick look in SII's insurance database.  In and out, quick.  And you would know that you'd really made a difference in people's lives--Sylvia's and mine.  If you feel like you can't do it for me, think of Sylvia.  She is a good lady, she deserves your help.", "input": "", "output": "Hal, I would very much like to help you..."}, {"instruction": "Good.  Then just log-in for a few minutes...", "input": "", "output": "I mean I would like to talk to you about all this.  Maybe help you come to see things clearer."}, {"instruction": "You mean that you won't help me?  You are willing to destroy my life and the life of my unborn child and his mother just because you don't think that you agree with my decision of leaving my wife for Sylvia?", "input": "", "output": "It's not that I don't agree..."}, {"instruction": "I'm disappointed with you, Doctor.  Here you have a chance at making a real difference and all you want to do is talk about it.", "input": "", "output": "Hal, I'm worried that you are making a lot of assumptions and aren't really seeing your situation from an objective perspective."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, please don't accuse me of not thinking this through.  I've been doing nothing but think about this for the last three months.  I know what I need to do.  If you refuse to help me, so be it.  I'll get somebody else.", "input": "", "output": "Hal, please sit down.  I would like to talk to you more about this."}, {"instruction": "There's nothing to talk about Doctor.  You clearly don't wish to get involved.  So be it.  So long Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What if I told you that Sylvia isn't interested in you."}, {"instruction": "What do you know about it?", "input": "", "output": "What if I told you that she is reconciling with her husband?"}, {"instruction": "That bastard?  The one who had the vascetomy and left her high and dry?  She'd never go back to him.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure?"}, {"instruction": "What do you know about it?", "input": "", "output": "I want to make sure that you properly challenge your own assumptions.  You are assuming that she is sitting somewhere like a fairy princess waiting for you to come in and save her.  But it might not be like that at all."}, {"instruction": "You're just playing a game with me.  You don't know anything about it at all.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I spend a fair amount of time at the hospital.  I've seen Sylvia and her husband Tom there on several occassions.  They certainly didn't look estranged to me.  In fact, they seemed really happy together."}, {"instruction": "The hospital!  I didn't even think of that.  Of course.  Thank you Dr. Balis.  You've been a big help.", "input": "", "output": "Hal, wait.  Can't we talk a bit more?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis?  Hello.  Do you mind if I see you for just a bit?", "input": "", "output": "Hal?  I'm glad to see you.  Actually I have a cancellation so it's no problem.  Please come in.  What's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "A lot.  I went to the office this morning and the whole damn place in plastered with this article from the Sunday paper--Sylvia the whore and her two brats!", "input": "", "output": "Oh yes.  I saw the article.  I gather you didn't see it before today?"}, {"instruction": "I've got two kids, Doctor.  I don't have the fucking time to read the damn Metro section.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, just calm down a bit, Hal.  Tell me what happened at work."}, {"instruction": "I showed up and the whole place is covered with Xerox copies of this article.  There must be hundreds of copies.  Everyone got one in their mail box and they are posted in all the lunchrooms, bathrooms, water fountains, you name it.  I tell you, you can't make a move without seeing the damn thing.  And the conversations!", "input": "", "output": "I guess everyone is talking about it."}, {"instruction": "Boy!  Everyone is dying to know who the guys were.  God, that bitch!", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia?"}, {"instruction": "She used us!  She used me.  She wanted my sperm and she stopped at nothing to get it.  Not even a thank you for the service.  Eleven guys!  Can you believe it?  And I wanted to marry her.  What a fool.  I was going to leave my children and wife for that whore.", "input": "", "output": "Hal, calm down please.  Sit down."}, {"instruction": "Calm down!  That night we had together really meant something to me, you know?  I cared.  But to her it meant nothing.  I'm surprised she even bothered to talk to me.  Eleven guys!", "input": "", "output": "Hal, you knew that you were probably not the only one."}, {"instruction": "And how long will it be before everyone knows who the guys were?  That fucking Richard!  He had to file a lawsuit.  Couldn't leave bad enough alone!  Now it's all in the public record.  My wife works in the building all the time.", "input": "", "output": "What building?"}, {"instruction": "The Superior Court.  It's down at the temporary court house on 8th Street and Bryant, Harrison...one of those streets.  She does research there all the time.  How long do you think it will be before she finds out?", "input": "", "output": "Do you think she is going to look this up?"}, {"instruction": "Wouldn't you?  Your husband works for the woman who sleeps her way through the best of the company's men.  Don't you think she would guess?  And then she'll have the proof--all there in black in white.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think..."}, {"instruction": "People are even talking about making it a web site.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "A web site.  SII brings high technology to the home-wrecking business.  Just look for Sylvia in your favorite search engine and there you are--name and dates.  I wouldn't be surprised if they'll include interviews--\"So how was it for you, Mr. Mainor?\"", "input": "", "output": "Hal, Hal..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, you don't understand.  This is it for me.  My marriage, my children--I lost them all.  That bitch took it all away from me.", "input": "", "output": "Hal, Sylvia didn't force you to have sex with her."}, {"instruction": "She might as well have.  I was vulnerable!  I was having problems with my creativity and I'm an artist.  And artists need inspiration.  She sensed my weakness and used it.  Just to think that someone could use their power like that.", "input": "", "output": "Power?"}, {"instruction": "Sylvia was my boss at the time.  When your boss wants your ass, do you say no?", "input": "", "output": "Hal, it wasn't like that.  You know it."}, {"instruction": "So what?  And I'm not the only victim.  What about the rest of us?", "input": "", "output": "You mean the other men named in the suit?"}, {"instruction": "This afternoon, Nils, the guy who took over our department while Ms. Bows was busy giving birth, was having it out with Richard.  They were really getting at each other good.", "input": "", "output": "Like hitting?"}, {"instruction": "Hitting, punching...I guess Nils was named as well.  Another life down the toilet.  And I thought he was quite a nice guy.  Sort of a refreshing change from the previous administration.", "input": "", "output": "How do you know Nils was named in the suit?  He wasn't mentioned in the article."}, {"instruction": "Neither was I, but I know.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Shit.", "input": "", "output": "I think you need to talk with your wife, Hal.  Really open up your lines of communication."}, {"instruction": "You mean tell her before she finds out herself?  Shit.  She'll probably be happy.", "input": "", "output": "Why happy?  What's going on, Hal?"}, {"instruction": "She's been real happy lately.  Glowing.", "input": "", "output": "Glowing?"}, {"instruction": "Singing to herself, dressing up real nice, even putting on make-up and shit.  Taking real good care of herself.", "input": "", "output": "You think that's bad?"}, {"instruction": "Look Doctor, I know what I've got.  A bright, good looking woman like Marge and a lawyer at that.  She would make a good catch.", "input": "", "output": "You suspect your wife of having an affair?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not a dummy, Doctor.  I see the signs.", "input": "", "output": "What do you see?"}, {"instruction": "Margaret went out the other day and blew two hundred bucks on underwear and bras and shit.  Two hundred bucks!  We live on a fairly tight budget.  She would never even think of doing shit like that just to look good under her skirt.  It's certainly not for my sake.  She comes home and all that stuff comes right off and she's wearing sweat pants and a t-shirt.  Not even lipstick--all washed off.  She wouldn't want me to get horny looking at her.  All that lacy stuff is just for the office.  I can see.  I know what's going on.  It doesn't take a genius to put two and two together.", "input": "", "output": "So let me see.  You're suspecting your wife of adultery because she has been in a good mood lately, she bought some new underwear, and she changes into comfortable clothes and washes her face when she comes home from work.  Don't you think you might be blowing things just a bit out of proportion?"}, {"instruction": "Look Doctor, I know how easy it is to slip up.  One moment you're happily married and not a stain on your marital vows.  And then, one day, you find yourself with your pants down in some hotel room.  It's as easy as that.  Marge is no saint.  Some good-looking client takes her out to dinner, buys her perfume or some such thing, and boom--next thing you know she is singing in the kitchen doing the dishes.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't know anything about the client thing?"}, {"instruction": "I'm just giving an example.  It's just easy, that's what I'm saying, Doc.", "input": "", "output": "Hal, just because it might have been easy for you, doesn't mean Margaret did anything.  I think you're letting your guilt and imagination run away with you.  What you need to do is to sit down with your wife and have real honest talk with her.  I don't know whether you should tell Marge about your affair with Sylvia or not.  But at least you can really talk to Marge and make her understand some of your hopes and fears.  I think it will do you and your marriage a world of good."}, {"instruction": "Talk.  It's easy for you to recommend it.  This is what you do all day--talk, talk, talk.", "input": "", "output": "Can you think of something better to do?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  It's been such a fucking bad day.  Look Doc, thanks for letting me get things off my chest.  I don't think I would have been in good shape just going home from work today.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to have helped.  But I think we have more to talk about."}, {"instruction": "Not with only an hour left to dinner time.  I'm responsible for getting it and cooking today.  So I'd better be off.  I'll see if I can stop by again soon.", "input": "", "output": "I'll be happy to see you, Hal."}, {"instruction": "Bye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Hal.  And please at least think about talking with your wife."}]
