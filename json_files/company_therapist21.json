[{"instruction": "Hi, Doctor Balis. It's nice to meet you.", "input": "", "output": "Please sit down."}, {"instruction": "Do I need to lie down or anything?", "input": "", "output": "If you think that would make you more comfortable."}, {"instruction": "Um, actually no. I'll just sit.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Let's get started."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "What have you come to see me about?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm having...I guess you could say I must be having a lot of unresolved anger or something. I've been getting really mad at all kinds of people lately.", "input": "", "output": "Friends and family?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. But it's more just people on the street. I've practically gotten into fights a few times in the last couple of weeks. Mostly when people whistle at me or make some comments. I get so mad because...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "See, this is where the confidentiality thing really comes into play with me. I work at SII during the day. I started there as a temp right after college. And when they offered me a full time job, I really didn't know what else I wanted to do with my life, so I took it for the benefits. And, of course, that's how I can afford to see you today.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But I also have another job. I took it mainly to pay off some credit card debts I managed to rack up...it's ridiculous how they just hand these things to college kids, and I wasn't too responsible with mine. Well, it was more just a matter of being broke all the time. And my salary at SII just doesn't cut it.", "input": "", "output": "So what is your other job?"}, {"instruction": "I started stripping at this place called the Lusty Lady. Do you know it?", "input": "", "output": "No."}, {"instruction": "Well, good. If you did, I would have to walk out of here right now.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I really like my job. In fact, it's one of the most interesting experiences I've ever had. And I really love some of the women I work with. They're all so right on...well, it's hard to explain. And the Lusty is a great place. It's owned and managed by women--there's even an employee's union.", "input": "", "output": "That does sound unusual for a strip club. Do you believe that if I knew this establishment, it would..."}, {"instruction": "If you knew about the place, I would assume that you were a customer. And no matter how you upgrade the sex industry, I think the customers will always be the same--a bunch of sorry, lonely losers with no respect for women at all.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Isn't it difficult working in an environment like that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the environment backstage is fantastic. Standing around the coffee machine in nothing but pumps and garters is hilarious, I think. And the conversations are a lot more interesting. I guess I'm just not really a corporate person. I've never been happy in an office, it doesn't matter what the business is. I had to temp during the summers to get through college, and I was always miserable.", "input": "", "output": "Did you try other professions? Other ways of making money?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I tried waiting tables, but I'm probably the worst waitress in the history of the world. Aside from the obvious errors I made and the many things I forgot and spilled, I just basically had an attitude problem. I can't stand serving people. I snapped at my customers and never got any tips. I was just a little piece of misery as a waitress. I think it was bad karma for me.", "input": "", "output": "If I had to guess, I'd say it sounded as if you were angry at your customers for having to serve them."}, {"instruction": "Definitely. Yes, that's very sharp actually. And even now, I'm still in a position where I'm serving people. Look, I don't want you to think I'm stupid or something. I know what I'm serving. And I know that it's very personal and sort of raw. But if there's a way to work through it, I'd like to find it. Because other than this side effect, stripping is the best job I've ever had. I'm even thinking of quitting SII to do it full time. I mean...well, I probably won't quit for a while.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  You want me to help you work through your anger, so you can feel better about serving your customers as a stripper. Did I get it right?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but I'm impatient. My whole life I've been this really good girl, and I'm sick of it. I have no interest in remaining in this whole SII corporate sphere. I feel trapped in it. And I feel different from all the women at work, at Lusty's I mean. Well, not all the women, but the cool ones anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Who are the cool ones?"}, {"instruction": "I guess...it sounds so dumb. They are basically the tattooed and pierced ones. I think I must have a lot of cool envy. It's sort of straight out of junior high. I just never feel quite right around those girls. But maybe this is one of those long-term therapy issues, because I never feel comfortable in most social situations. I always feel on the outside of any group, and I never seem to have what it takes to make it...to make myself the one who's at the center.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been in therapy before?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yeah. But it never really worked out.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about that."}, {"instruction": "Well, in school they had a therapist at the clinic. But she was like a dinosaur. Really, she even looked like a big old lizard. And she would just sit there and listen while I went on and on about my family and how poor I was. I talked to all my friends about her. Sophomore year, we all confessed that we had gone to see this woman. This lady had tried to convince all my gay friends that they were really straight. And vice versa. So I don't know what she was about.", "input": "", "output": "Where did you go to college?"}, {"instruction": "Berkeley. I was an English major--as in everybody speaks it, but nobody pays for it. I had no idea what I wanted to do after school. Or, for that matter, why I went to school. I was pretty much just hell-bent on getting away from home.", "input": "", "output": "Why was that?"}, {"instruction": "Because my folks are both completely crazy. Uh, I hope we won't have to talk too much about that. But I guess I'll have to take you through the whole ugly story.", "input": "", "output": "I would like to know about your family and those relationships."}, {"instruction": "The thing is I'm pretty settled on all of that. I really don't think it's affecting me anymore. In fact, I grew up in a really weird situation, but now it seems to have really settled itself. I've made peace with my folks for the most part. So I sort of feel like I'm here about things that are going on in my life now, like getting mad at people I don't know. I constantly want to say, \"Look, not on my free time.\" I get hassled enough at work, and I don't want to deal with it on my off days.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I'm following you.  Are you talking about your personal life? Are you getting angry at men you date?"}, {"instruction": "I get enough of it at work, thank you. But I get really angry, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "So you want to find a way to control your impulse to anger?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess that's it. I feel like eventually I'm going to get myself killed in a bad, bad way if I keep this up. Most people ignore this kind of stuff. But I just have to make a point of saying something about it. I can't control myself.", "input": "", "output": "I gather we are talking about sexual advances, right?"}, {"instruction": "Not only.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Mostly I would try to get at the underlying cause of the anger and try to squelch it from understanding those causes better.  But if control is all you're after, maybe you can try the old counting to ten technique."}, {"instruction": "Is that an official prescription?", "input": "", "output": "We're just getting started. There seem to be a lot of issues that we need to explore. And until we spend a bit more time and go deeper into all of this, counting to ten before responding to an angry impulse seems like it's worth a try. When you feel yourself becoming angry, try to delay your reaction. You might also want to try to free associate a little bit and see if the particular anger-provoking situation reminds you of anything else in your life that made you respond similarly.  Maybe you're not really responding to the situation in front of you, but something's triggered a memory of a situation in your past."}, {"instruction": "Well, I definitely know what makes me feel the same way.", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "My job. What I need is a way to separate my feelings about work from my feelings about the world.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever considered taking some time off from work?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but it's really my job at SII that I would like to take some time off from.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "You see, I started getting involved in some things that are really interesting to me. There is this very interesting place where they make videos, and I wanted to explore the possibilities. But I have no time at all to do any of that stuff. There's no one there who has a real day job. People who work there arrange their own schedules and can make time to do their videos and stuff. I want to be able to do that, too. I just feel like I'm close to people who live the way they want to live. Like my roommate--she got me into this Lusty job in the first place. She's just so much cooler, from where I'm sitting, than anyone I work with at SII.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Lisa, we got a good start today, but our time is up. Try out my suggestion. The next time you feel an angry outburst coming up, count to ten and see if you can control your outward expressions of rage."}, {"instruction": "I guess I can try to do that.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Would you like to come in next week?"}, {"instruction": "I was kind of interested in coming every other week. My schedule is pretty crazy--two jobs and all. Maybe when things open up a little, I can come more often.", "input": "", "output": "Every two weeks will be fine. Our next appointment then will be Tuesday, April 7th, at four in the afternoon.  Does that work for you?"}, {"instruction": "That's fine, thanks.  I'll see you then.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Lisa."}, {"instruction": "Pretty good. Very busy and tired. But I tried out your suggestion, and I think it actually did work a couple of times.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Did you use the counting technique to help you control your anger?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, twice actually. Coming home from work, I walk down Market Street, and it's the real drag of my life. I just get tons and tons of comments from people on the street. I'm sure this happened to me a lot before I started working at the Lusty Lady, but I used to just ignore it. But now, I just can't stand to be bothered. I guess my attitude has changed. Now, I get paid to show myself to jerks all day long, so on my time off, they really have no right to bother me for free.", "input": "", "output": "Do you normally react with anger to these comments?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. One time, I got so mad that I chased after a guy who was cat-calling me from his car. I even took a swipe at him with my backpack.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds dangerous."}, {"instruction": "It was fairly stupid, and it turned out to be very dangerous. He grabbed my bag, and the driver of the car took off. They didn't go very fast. But he started driving, and I didn't want to let go of my bag. I held onto my bag and was almost pleading with them to let go of it while I ran alongside their car. They got it away from me and then threw it onto the street. I had to run and pick it up. The whole time, they were laughing. It was so awful. That happened about a month ago, I think, and it was one of the things that made me come to see you.", "input": "", "output": "Because you got angry like that, you put yourself into a threatening situation."}, {"instruction": "I know.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about the times this week that you were able to control your anger."}, {"instruction": "Well, I was walking home from work the other night, and this guy got right in my face. It was Friday, pretty late, but there were a lot of people out. One of those stupid college frat boys came right up to me, and he whispered in this really low voice, \"Oooh yeah, pretty babe, walk that way some more.\"", "input": "", "output": "Were you walking in a provocative manner?"}, {"instruction": "Hell no. I was walking in a dead tired manner. Maybe he was being sarcastic. Maybe he thought he had a right to point out that I wasn't being sexy enough walking down the street. Or maybe my exhausted walk was really provocative, I don't know. Anyway, I almost blew up at him. But I somehow managed to just cool it and keep walking. That's when I counted to ten. I was afraid I'd turn around and start screaming at him. But by the time I got to ten, I had turned the next corner.", "input": "", "output": "How did you feel about keeping yourself under control?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure I avoided some trouble. But I did feel upset at the unfairness of somebody...anybody thinking they can say things like that to me. I think it got under my skin for the rest of that day, actually.", "input": "", "output": "Were you unable to release your anger?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess that's it.", "input": "", "output": "What about the other time?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the other time was at work, at the Lusty Lady. During one of my late night shifts, I got incredibly mad at this guy who kept asking me to come over to his window. He was really insistent. I was actually told when I got hired that I would never have to take orders from customers.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean, his window?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I guess I should explain the way the Lusty Lady works. It's a peep show. There's a space where women are dancing, and surrounding them are ten windows. Customers put in quarters, the windows slide up, and there we are dancing. It's like that Madonna video, do you know which one I'm talking about?", "input": "", "output": "No, but I understand the setup."}, {"instruction": "Okay. So, on the other side of the windows, the men are masturbating. Well, not all of them, but a lot of them.", "input": "", "output": "And you can see this?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Except for a couple of windows, we can see those guys through the windows. Actually, a lot of them seem to like us watching them more than they like to watch us. That was one of the first things that struck me as interesting. The whole thing is fascinating, to be honest. Human sexuality is a wacky, wacky freak show.", "input": "", "output": "You must see a variety of...."}, {"instruction": "Fetishes, deviant behavior, odd couplings and triplings. Yeah, what comes through there is just insane. But it's all so glorious to me, in a way. It's craziness everywhere, and it's all normal people from all walks of life. It's just your average guys, and they turn out to have all this drama going on. I love it.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you get angry?"}, {"instruction": "Right, back to my story. This guy kept motioning me over to his window and knocking on the glass. On the late shift, the supervisors go home. And sometimes, one of the girls will blow up at a customer. No one would rat anyone else out, so late night is venting time. But I wanted to see if I could get a handle on myself, so first, I just explained the rules to him. When he didn't stop, I told everyone I was going on break--I switched breaks with the girl who was supposed to go right then. Then in the dressing room, I just calmed myself down. I called security and made them toss the guy out--this is our prerogative if we feel like a customer is bothering us.", "input": "", "output": "Do you exercise that right often?"}, {"instruction": "No, I usually get caught up in yelling at the customer before I get to that point. But I have to say, it felt great to play by the rules. And I did get some release for my anger because the guy got kicked out. And he got no release, if you know what I mean. That was a nice revenge for me.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Did you have any insights into the underlying issues that could have caused you to become so angry?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, and I'm not so happy about it. I think--when I really admit it to myself--the job at the Lusty Lady hasn't been all just interesting, fascinating, and positive. I think it's getting to me. It's making me distrust men everywhere, no matter who they are. I look at all the men at SII as if they are my customers.", "input": "", "output": "And in your first session, you suspected I might be a customer."}, {"instruction": "Right. And even if you aren't, I believe that you could be. I'm sorry if that's insulting to you. I think in the last couple of weeks I started to realize that I have this perception of men as being all the same, but that's not the reality. My perception is being warped a little by what I do.", "input": "", "output": "I know I brought this up last week, but do these thoughts make you consider taking a break from this job?"}, {"instruction": "No, they make me realize that I'll be able to work through this, so I can do this job and so I can get involved in all the other things I want to do. Oh my god! I almost forgot to tell you. I am going to start volunteering at this excellent place where I can trade office hours for editing time.", "input": "", "output": "Editing time?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, editing videos. I want to start directing videos. I've been afraid to do it for the longest time. Actually, I'm still afraid. But I think I'm going to make a documentary about the Lusty Lady. If I can get free editing time and use the camera at this place, it will be very cheap to make. I know that a lot of people make documentaries about this subject--stripping, I mean--but I think it's best to start with something that really captures your interest, don't you think? That way, you'll definitely finish your project.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know a lot about making films and videos?"}, {"instruction": "No, I really don't. But I talked to people who said that they didn't know much either when they started out. I thought I would take a class first, but they are all telling me that the best way to learn is by doing. I'm totally excited about this. I want to have more free days to work on this.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you have found something that peaks your interest. We have to stop now, but I'll be interested to hear how things progress at this new place. You won't be quitting SII anytime soon, will you?"}, {"instruction": "I think I'm going to have to change my schedule pretty soon. But first, I want to pay off more of my credit card bills. I'm in pretty deep with that. So I'm stuck at SII for a while longer.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Well, our time is up. I'll see you in two weeks."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. See you then.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Lisa."}, {"instruction": "Great! I have so much to tell you about this new place I'm working at.", "input": "", "output": "The video place?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Video Free America.  It's completely great. I met another woman there; she also works as a stripper, except she works at a job that pays a lot, lot more. She is making a documentary about her job, too. It was really interesting talking to her about it. She is doing the same thing I want to do--she's teaching herself as she's going along.", "input": "", "output": "Has this made you feel that your project has more of a possibility of becoming a reality?"}, {"instruction": "Definitely. This is great because I have so much fear about actually undertaking it. I'm so afraid that anything I'll try to do will just suck.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess this is as good a time as ever to get into my family a little bit. I think they really discouraged me from doing anything creative when I was growing up. Now, they are actually very excited about my job at SII. I think they want me to get into programming.", "input": "", "output": "What is it that you do at SII?"}, {"instruction": "I'm a secretary and I hate it. I do think I can actually work there as...well, as something more than a secretary. I'm actually great with computers. But I don't think I'd enjoy a real job there, although I'm sure I have the aptitude. I guess if I were really on the ball, I would use my experience there and with some more training...", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "They have a special effects department, and they have even done some film stuff. I guess I can make a move into that.", "input": "", "output": "You don't sound very enthusiastic about that idea."}, {"instruction": "Somehow it's just not where my heart lies. It seems like the easy path. I want to go off-road. I love meeting the people at this video place, and I love hanging out with the other women at the Lusty Lady. I guess I'm attracted to people who have had it a little tough.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that is?"}, {"instruction": "In these two little sub-worlds--the Lusty Lady and Video Free America--I've found all these people who seem to know where it's at. People at SII seem so sheltered to me. Maybe I'm wrong about that. Maybe they're like everyone else--perverts, but only in private. I like it when people let their weirdness show, when they're just open about it. When they can get past that hang-up, they can move on to realizing some amazing things about themselves.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you think the people you are meeting at the video place are more open-minded?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Some of them have been through some really terrible things. It's unbelievable. This women at work, Gabby, was a prostitute on the street and was addicted to heroin. But now, she's finishing up her education at Berkeley. She's getting the highest chemistry grade in her class. She's a smart kid with a twist. I think that's the coolest way to be. She came from a really awful home and went through some horrible times. But now...she may actually become my roommate soon, we're subletting a room together.", "input": "", "output": "Lisa, I can see that you admire people who have come from a difficult background and bettered themselves. But do you think that makes them superior to someone who comes from a supportive background?"}, {"instruction": "They've seen ups and downs at a younger age. They had to provide for themselves rather than depend on their parents. I want to go more that route. I don't know. Maybe it's because my parents got their nose in my business. I guess I need to break free of that...of them.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me more about your parents."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's a lot of things.  My job at SII, for example. But other things, too. But SII is a real sore point. They feel like I have a lot of potential I'm not living up to. They are disappointed that I'm just a secretary. And I can't tell them about any of the other stuff I'm doing. I was an English major, and that was a disappointment, too. I guess they wanted me to go for more practical stuff, but I wasn't interested. The thing is that I don't really commit to the things I actually do want. I'm stuck in the middle. I probably should have ditched college altogether and gone to film school. But I had this feeling that I should get a good, basic liberal arts education.", "input": "", "output": "Was this your parents' feeling as well?"}, {"instruction": "It must have been. It's not even so much what they said. It's how they always acted whenever I brought up the idea of making a film. I wanted to put together this project in high school--just a little video where I'd follow one of my friends around for a day. Somehow, it just never got done. I'm not sure why. But I always remember thinking that I just didn't have what it takes or something.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you got this idea from your parents?"}, {"instruction": "I just know that neither one of them really got to do what they wanted with their lives. Growing up, I remember them saying stuff like, \"Remember, there are no happy lives, only happy moments.\"", "input": "", "output": "Who told you that?"}, {"instruction": "My mom. I think I was crying about something, probably about some boy who didn't ask me to dance in junior high or something. Wow. Actually now that I'm thinking about that, that's pretty crazy. My mom should have been telling me the usual motherly line about how there would be plenty of boys or that I'd grow up to be pretty or something. That's what you'd see on a television, right? But instead, she was telling me to get used to misery. Great. And at thirteen, I was supposed to take that advice?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It sounds so unnecessarily grim. Yeah. So anyway, I know she gave me some weird messages about other things.", "input": "", "output": "Do you remember any of them?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, this one has to do with the video thing. I remember saying something like, \"Hey, Mom, I think I want to be a director.\" I probably started saying this pretty young, because I was always into movies as long as I can remember.", "input": "", "output": "What did your mom say to that?"}, {"instruction": "And she would say, \"Well, it's very difficult. Many people who try to get into this field end up with broken dreams.\" Then she'd get this far off look in her eye, like she was imagining all of her broken dreams. It was annoying at the time. I thought she was being totally over-dramatic. But maybe I believed her on some level. Oh! I have to split just a little early today.", "input": "", "output": "Work?"}, {"instruction": "I'm meeting some of my friends from work, we are going to a movie. I think we're going to get a little wasted and see this animation festival.", "input": "", "output": "Wasted?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah...well, I'm not sure how you feel about that, but I guess I should tell you everything, right? We're just going to get a little high", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "And then later, we might go dancing and do some speed.", "input": "", "output": "Are you a regular user of these drugs?"}, {"instruction": "I'm a recreational user. I guess I'll talk more about that later. Okay? I promise. I really have to run! Bye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not thrilled about you ending the session early so that you can go do drugs, but we'll talk about this next time.  Goodbye, Lisa."}, {"instruction": "Not so great, Doctor. I'm just exhausted. I've been burning the candle at both ends lately. Actually, what I've been doing is just throwing the candle right into the fire.", "input": "", "output": "Your two jobs are wearing you out?"}, {"instruction": "Definitely, yes. And I'm afraid my anger is really coming back lately. My patience is wearing thin, probably because I'm tired.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have another outburst?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Uh, I can't even talk about that now. Let me tell you about my week first, and then maybe I'll get to this at the end of the session. It was a really disturbing incident.", "input": "", "output": "All right. Tell me about your week."}, {"instruction": "Well, I started asking around at the Lusty Lady--I was doing research for my documentary--and everybody seemed pretty cool about me making this video. I had a long conversation with one of my coworkers. It turns out she's a dominatrix, she does that in addition to the Lusty Lady. She said that she makes a ton of money. After talking with her, I felt like I was nickel and diming it at the Lusty. She was completely interesting, and I actually scheduled a filmed interview with her. Hopefully, it will be as good as our talk was. Anyway, it was really a big deal for me to even ask her. I was actually nervous and shaky as I was asking.", "input": "", "output": "Why were you so nervous?"}, {"instruction": "I think I was afraid she'd laugh at my little project. But she didn't. So hopefully, that part of the project will get easier for me in the future.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Anyway, that talk was pretty much the only down time I had this entire week. The rest of the time, I was working non-stop and hardly sleeping at all. I worked a double Thursday night--I was dancing from six to eleven and then from eleven to four in the morning. When you work that late at the Lusty, you get to spend the night. After work, we all stayed up talking for a couple of hours. And then it was pretty much time for me to go back to SII. I worked all day there and then went back to the Lusty that night and worked again until eleven. This was all on no sleep. Finally, I got to go home and catch a few winks. And then Saturday morning, I got up and started dancing again. And then someone called in sick, and I worked a double shift. It was crazy.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to work so many hours?"}, {"instruction": "I really want to get out of debt, and I'm getting closer and closer. I want to be solvent by the time I really start to edit this video. From everything I heard, when that starts, I'll be locked up by myself for entire nights, and I'll want to be able to focus on my editing. I want to quit SII by the time I start editing. But man, life is rough. I wouldn't have gotten through this week without a little speed.", "input": "", "output": "You were using speed to help you cope?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Until now, I really haven't used speed except at parties. But this week was such a killer. It really helped. But it's always around the Lusty.", "input": "", "output": "Lisa, I think we need to talk about your drug use. I feel strongly..."}, {"instruction": "Right, right. I'll give you my drug history, Doctor. I think I'm a usual college story. I smoked pot and took some mushrooms a few times. I always avoided cocaine and anything heavy.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Speed seems to be a big thing with the crowd I'm getting into these days. I enjoy it when I go out. Other than that, I've taken it...well, a few times when my schedule had gotten out of control. It focuses me. But it's such a bummer coming down from it. I have to say I really enjoy it, probably too much, except for that part. Look, Doctor, I hope you're not going to get judgmental about this.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not here to judge you. But I don't approve of drug use either. Speed can be extremely addictive, and I'm worried..."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know. I think I'm in the clear right now. Well, I'll be careful. Anyway, I had my...uh, \"moment\" when I was coming down from speed.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mean the anger incident?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. So I guess I'm really not interested in becoming addicted.", "input": "", "output": "All right, tell me about the incident."}, {"instruction": "Yikes. This one is really rough. My job at the Lusty is so gritty. Have I told you about the private booth?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think so."}, {"instruction": "Mostly when I work at the Lusty, I'm just dancing around with four other women, and things are pretty easy going. But if you want to make some real money, the place to do it is the booth. There, I'm one on one with a customer, and I work for tips. First of all, I'm on display in this window for all walkers-by to see, and I sort of have to sell myself to them. I guess it's like the red light district in Amsterdam--that kind of set up.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So I'm there in my little sexy lingerie, and they're all going by, checking me out or being assholes and yelling obnoxious bullshit at me. Finally, I get a customer to come inside the booth. Then I close a curtain across the outside window, and I wait for the guy to put five dollars in this little slot. Then I open another curtain inside the booth. He gets three minutes for five dollars to watch me through the glass. So I take off my clothes and pose. The whole point is to get him to stay for more time or to get him to put more money in by offering to do all kinds of crazy shit.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, here comes the shocker. I've put dildos inside myself, peed into cups, talked through S&M fantasies, watched the guy suck off his friend. I mean this is whatever goes. It's a laugh a minute, I'm telling you.", "input": "", "output": "Couples can go into the booth also?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. And sometimes, there will be two girls in there, and that's like a special or something. This is much more intense than dancing. Really, to be totally honest, this is just prostitution through the glass. It's the same thing.", "input": "", "output": "Do you enjoy it?"}, {"instruction": "I'm completely fascinated by it, and I guess most of it doesn't bother me. I'm wearing a wig, and I just feel like I'm playing a character and getting to have all of these crazy experiences. But sometimes, it just fucking depresses me so much.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "All of these lonely people come in, and they're so disconnected from themselves and what they want. When I close the curtain sometimes after they finish, I just feel completely awful. It's this weird aloneness. It's like the truth of the world: nobody can really connect with anyone else or touch anyone else. Does it make sense? Sometimes, I get really into it--it's like I'm learning what life is really about, and I think it's going to make me really tough. But sometimes, it just makes me cry. Some of the girls were saying that one really needs to take a break from doing the booth to stay sane. But right now, I'm really trying to step up the money making thing, so I'm working other people's shifts in the booth. I'm making big bucks. But I'm burning out.", "input": "", "output": "The booth sounds very draining physically and psychologically."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess it's terrible. It's not the part of the job I really enjoy. I like dancing around naked with some friends. But the booth is way too much. I'll be glad to stop soon.", "input": "", "output": "Lisa, there are other jobs that don't require such a high emotional price for working them. Your work doesn't have to upset you so much."}, {"instruction": "Believe me, I'm thinking about it. But now, I'm wrapped up in this documentary project, and I'm in such a good place to finish it. But yes, I'm thinking about leaving. I just feel like other people around me manage to deal with it, so there must be a way that I can cope with it as well.", "input": "", "output": "You don't know how well they are coping. And just because someone does it, it doesn't mean that you can. We all have our limits. It's probably best if you knew yours."}, {"instruction": "Right. Goddamn. I guess I'm just trying to figure out mine right now.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. I'd encourage you not to venture into areas that make you so uncomfortable that you have to resort to drugs to get through the day."}, {"instruction": "You know what, though? That's where I want to go. I think I really need to get into the really dark places in life right now. I'm not sure why. I just have this need to figure it out. It's like I want to see everything there is to see, to see if I can handle it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. That's very dangerous. I urge you to be careful with that kind of experimentation. Now tell me about your outburst."}, {"instruction": "Well, I feel a little weird talking about it now. But if I don't, I think it would be worse to carry it within me for the next two weeks. I haven't talked to anybody about this.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "Well, the whole time this crazy shit was going on in the booth, I was basically...well, masturbating. That's what they all like to see. So, it was only natural that I got pretty aroused. Everyone does. We all talk about how we have to go get ourselves off after the booth shift is over. Well, at least those of us who aren't having sex with someone in the real world. But I never come in front of customers. I always fake it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Except I was so over excited that day, and I had this customer who just would not fucking leave. He kept on putting money in. It was like this weird contest. I actually think that he would not have left until I came. So finally, I actually did have an orgasm right there in front of him. I tried to just be really low key about it, thinking he wouldn't notice or something. But then I looked at him, and he had this awful smile on his face, like he had won our little duel. And I just lost it. I was so mad that he thought he had won. I really felt like I gave him something I didn't want to give. It was just terrible. I was calling him an asshole. And he just left. And I felt like a piece of me just walked out the door with him.", "input": "", "output": "I really think you should stop doing the booth for a while."}, {"instruction": "Maybe you're right. Just talking about that whole thing...well, I feel awful again. But you know what? I have a booth shift tonight. And it's too late to get out of it.", "input": "", "output": "How soon before you can stop accepting these shifts?"}, {"instruction": "The schedule comes out every week. I'll just try to trade my next couple of shifts this week. But that's after tonight.", "input": "", "output": "Good. And try to avoid speed. It just takes away your control over the situation. And that is what I think made you so upset--your customer wrestled control from you during the booth session. Well, our time is up. We should definitely talk more about this next time, though."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I'll try to get out of doing the booth. It's just that I need that money. But I guess I should take a break. Thanks, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "See you next time, Lisa."}, {"instruction": "Much better. I was really pretty sick two weeks ago.", "input": "", "output": "What was wrong?"}, {"instruction": "My roommate, Gabrielle, got this flu that was going around the Lusty Lady. As you can imagine, there's no way to avoid catching germs there. We're in such a small room dancing, and we all touch the same bars and...everyone got sick with this very same thing, and it was awful.", "input": "", "output": "What was it?"}, {"instruction": "A stomach flu, it was just terrible. I was really out of commission, couldn't keep anything down. The only thing good about it was that I took some sick days from SII, so I got to lay in bed and still make some money. Also, I stopped dancing for a little while. I've got to say my perspective on things really changed.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "I think I've been going about this credit card thing all wrong. I need to spread it out a little and not treat myself so badly while I'm paying it off. And stopping dancing definitely made me think a lot about what I'm doing at the Lusty Lady. Actually, I still got to work on the film--I interviewed Gabby while we were home. She has had a pretty crazy life. I'm a little bit less enchanted with it now.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about it."}, {"instruction": "Gabby used to work on the streets in Boston. And then she started doing dominatrix work. Everything's happened to her. She's been pregnant. She got raped. She and her boyfriend were addicted to heroin. Her parents were totally abusive and kicked her out of the house. And she's so smart. But I think it will probably take her another couple of decades to calm down enough to be happy.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "She seems to create so much drama in her life all the time. She has this one girlfriend now who is still doing heroin, and this makes her want to get back into it again. It seems so obvious to me that she shouldn't be dating someone like that. But she's not going to stop. I think she likes the danger. It would mess her up so badly in school, if she got back into heroin right now. She has to do really well this semester to maintain her scholarship. But I think she likes walking on thin ice. Actually, I don't think she would do as well if things were comfortable and normal. She thrives on danger.", "input": "", "output": "Are you upset by that?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I am. Do you know what? I'm upset because I'm like that. Lying around in bed for a week, stuck in my house, I started to realize it's not really that nice there. I think I need to figure out some things about how to live or something.", "input": "", "output": "Lisa, did you do more speed?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm? Did I? Yes, a little. I did some editing just for practice. And I did a little speed before that so I could stay up all night for it. Actually, as I was about to do that, I was thinking just how gritty that was, and I was kind of into it. Oh wait! I actually did a little more speed, but it was just this one day when I didn't have to work. I went shopping with my friend Amy, and we did a little just before that. It was great, actually. You can definitely get through thrift stores quicker when you're high.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you are using it fairly frequently."}, {"instruction": "Maybe, maybe. But I don't think it's something you should get on my case about. I've thought about it a lot. I think my drug use is different from Gabby's. A lot of people in their early twenties experiment with drugs, and I fit right into that category. I like it, and I want to use it. It's not something I think about every day or need. I just happen to enjoy it. If I really had a problem with it, I wouldn't be able to pay off my credit card debt every month.", "input": "", "output": "I don't want to get on your case about this, but I wouldn't be doing you a favor if I didn't continue to point out the danger of that drug. It can be highly addictive and dangerous. And considering that you are attracted to danger, I must warn you about what you're playing around with."}, {"instruction": "Yes, yes. I know. I'll be careful.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "The editing was really hard. I took one of my interviews and just fiddled around with it. It made me realize how difficult this project is going to be. When you edit documentary footage, it's so difficult to figure out where and what to cut. I'm not even sure what I want to say yet. So basically, I just logged everything so I would know where it was on the tape. Editing natural dialogue is hard. People really digress, and there are a lot of \"ums\" and \"ahs,\" it slows things down. I tried to write an outline, and it's going to be really tough as well.", "input": "", "output": "Is there someone who can help you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, everyone who works at the place where I edit offered help in some way. So I think I'm going to get more advice and help than I'll really need. But in the end, I think I'm just going to have to plow through it all on my own. I definitely need a break from thinking about it. In fact, maybe you'll like this--I'm going camping by myself. I'll definitely be clean then.", "input": "", "output": "Where are you going?"}, {"instruction": "Point Reyes. My friend, Amy, had this reservation and she can't use it. So I'm borrowing her tent and going instead. I was going to try and get someone to come along with me, but then I decided to just go by myself. At first, I thought that was pretty pathetic, but now I'm really into it. The week I was sick, I was thinking about this trip more and more. I want to just go and sit and think for a weekend and look at some nature. I don't think I can keep working these two jobs and keep these weird hours, but I'm not sure what to do right now. Maybe there I'll be able to come up with some answers.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds good. Are you worried about going by yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, actually, a little. I've traveled a bit by myself before, though. One summer during college, I traveled in Europe. It was actually pretty fun. I wish I could find someone else to do stuff like that with, though.", "input": "", "output": "No one wanted to go to Europe with you?"}, {"instruction": "No. When I went, there wasn't anybody. I had some very solitary times in school. When I traveled, I had just broken up with my boyfriend, and it seemed like I had absolutely no social circuit to replace him. Now, it's kind of the same, I guess. I feel like I don't have a lot of close friends.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that is?"}, {"instruction": "My two best friends moved to New York after college, and I haven't really connected with anyone at work. And even at the Lusty Lady, where I find a lot of the women really compelling, I also think they are a little scary. I think they're all a little nuts. There's always some wacked-out conversation in the dressing room. Take Gabby, for instance...hey! By the way, I stopped doing the booth. I'm making less money, but I'm definitely dealing a lot better.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. Do you think you will ever go back to the booth?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. They really put a lot of pressure on us to do it.", "input": "", "output": "Who?"}, {"instruction": "The managers. Man, those women are totally nuts. When I first started working at this place, I thought that \"owned and managed by women\" would be such a great thing. But actually, I think that women managers are even worse in some ways. All of our bosses used to be dancers, but they seem to have gotten a little lost in that world. I wouldn't want to end up a manager of a strip club. My job is great, but I'm starting to see it as a temporary step.", "input": "", "output": "What about SII?"}, {"instruction": "To be honest, now that I'm not working quite so many hours at the Lusty Lady, things are actually a little better at SII. I'm enjoying the day a little more. I'm even thinking that maybe I should look into their special effects thing. Everyone's very excited about this new mole, but I couldn't care less about it. But I guess it means the company will be in good shape for a while. I'm starting to think, as far as secretarial jobs go, I'm not doing so badly. I just wish I had more days free. I would love to be able to work at Video Free America during the day.", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "Huh? Video Free America? That's the place where I've been editing. I can't believe I've never told you the name of that place. That's weird.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I just don't have a clue. I really thought...well, I don't know if we'll figure that one out now. Aren't we out of time?", "input": "", "output": "Not really."}, {"instruction": "Well, I think I still better go.  I'm still not a hundred percent.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Will I see you in two weeks?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I'll be here. See you then.", "input": "", "output": "Bye, Lisa."}, {"instruction": "Do I look that bad?", "input": "", "output": "It looks like you have a rash on your face."}, {"instruction": "No, I just pick at my face when I get anxious--and this week has really been a doozy. It's a terrible habit really. I get it from my mother, I think.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Uh, it's something I should have figured out would happen. But I would rather start by telling you about my camping trip. It's sort of the setup for the big fall.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm actually all right physically. But emotionally, I've been feeling really crazy lately. So let me start with my trip. I think it'll help if I talk about everything in the order that it happened.", "input": "", "output": "All right. So you went to Point Reyes?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, and it was just fantastic. That was the weekend after I saw you. I drove out in a car that I managed to borrow from my mom's friend. Did I ever tell you that my mom lives in Walnut Creek?", "input": "", "output": "No."}, {"instruction": "Well, she lives out there. And one of her neighbors has let me borrow this old Toyota a few times, like when I moved. So I went out to my mom's place on Friday to pick up the car, and we had a monster, giant, huge conversation.", "input": "", "output": "About what?"}, {"instruction": "About what I'm doing with my life. Of course I hadn't told her about my job at the Lusty Lady, and she was getting on my case about SII and how great that company is. She's all fired up about their stock prices and the news about this Mole. She thinks I can get in on this new technology wave and take over corporate America or something. I kept trying to tell her about the video I was working on, hoping she'd see that I was involved in some cool stuff. I was really proud of the footage that I edited so far--I have only about four minutes edited. Finally, she said, \"Okay, let's take a look at it.\" So I popped in a VHS tape I dubbed off my master. I was carrying it in my bag, because I showed it to someone at Video Free America.", "input": "", "output": "What did she think of your work?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she was completely fascinated, and she laughed in all the right places--some of it is funny. And she was actually very impressed. When it was finished, she just looked at me in amazement. She couldn't believe that I had done it. And she kept on saying, \"It seems so professional!\" I said, \"Mom, all of these shots are poorly lit. They're fuzzy red because the chroma levels sucks...\" But she couldn't even believe that I knew what I was talking about. Actually, I just learned these terms, so it was funny that I came off sounding so informed. Then she hit me with the killer question: \"How did you get such wonderfully candid interviews?\"", "input": "", "output": "And did you tell her the truth?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I did. I felt that it was exactly the right time, because there she was feeling so proud of me. The reason my video is going to be good is because I'm so incredibly close to the material. I wanted to be honest with her about that.", "input": "", "output": "What was her reaction?"}, {"instruction": "At first, she was very surprised. And then, she got really worried. She'd just heard these women talking about very graphic stuff, and I could see those images going through her head. She didn't like it at all. She was really concerned and scared for me. But the video also talks about how the Lusty Lady is different because it's owned and managed by women. So we talked about it for a while, and she did seem to calm down. She's actually a pretty liberal person, a child of the sixties. But I think she was more open-minded to the concept of someone else's daughter being a stripper. Eventually, she did start to see that I was doing it to get close to my documentary subject.", "input": "", "output": "So do you think your mother took the news rather well?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I think so. And then I told her that I really thought I was living a kind of adventure. Of course, I didn't tell her how gritty or how depressing this job can be. But that word \"adventure\" seemed to strike a chord with her. I know that she would have liked to do a lot of things in her life, but she had kids instead. I think she understood that what I'm doing is my way of not settling for less. Anyway, it was a very long conversation. We talked about how I edited and my thought process for the film, and she was hanging on my every word. Poor mom. I do think she could have been a creative person, maybe a writer.", "input": "", "output": "What does your mother do?"}, {"instruction": "She works at a hospital, doing administrative and insurance stuff in this little room behind the emergency room. She's great at it. But they work her to death and don't pay her enough.", "input": "", "output": "She thought you were doing something exciting with your life?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so. I left early the next morning, and that conversation got me started off on a great weekend. I set up my tent near the water, and everything was just so damn beautiful. There was this tall grass, and this one perfectly bending tree, and some wild blackberries. I just listened to the ocean and wrote in my journal. And I got very involved in mapping out the rest of the video based on my conversation with my mother. I had such a great time being by myself. I got so much done. And I thought a lot about my life and what I've been doing. And I came back completely refreshed. And then last week, Thursday, the big fall happened.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about it."}, {"instruction": "Someone from SII came into the Lusty Lady.", "input": "", "output": "Who?"}, {"instruction": "Scott Collavito. He works in graphics or something. He came in with a bunch of other guys. It was probably some kind of bachelor party or some get together with a lot of friends thing. Scott is hardly a regular type customer. Actually, he's a pretty good looking guy. Every kind of guy comes to the Lusty, but I would never picture this guy going in there. It must have been one of those spur of the moment things. Sometimes a group of guys will come in just to see what a peep show is really all about.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Scott recognized you?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, that very question is what has me picking compulsively at my face. I skipped work on Friday because I just could not deal with possibly seeing Scott there. And then yesterday and today, I went to work, but our paths didn't cross. I'm completely stressing out about it. I was wearing a long, red wig, and my whole persona at the Lusty is so incredibly different from my secretary persona. But I'm not sure how long he was at a window booth before I caught sight of him. He might have been there long enough to be able to put things together. God, just thinking about this...I'm sure he did. Of course he did.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think he'll confront you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I don't know. I hope not. But on the other hand, I'd prefer that Scott confronted me instead of spreading his suspicions around the company. Crap! That's what has me really worried. Am I going to have to defend myself to the entire office? Should I just quit? I was feeling like I wanted to get more involved at SII. But if this gets out, will I be able to even show my face there? They can't just fire me for having another job, can they?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think so."}, {"instruction": "But maybe they can find other reasons to fire me if they really want to. Jesus, why did this have to happen right when I started to actually care about SII? It's so ridiculous. I do want to try and move up there. But on the other hand, maybe I should just quit now and have more time for Video Free America. This incident has pointed how impossible it is to have a straight job world and do stripping on the side. I could make the same amount of money in twenty hours at the Lusty Lady that I make in forty at SII. And if I audition at some other strip places, I could make much more than that.", "input": "", "output": "Are you seriously thinking of quitting SII?"}, {"instruction": "I'm so confused right now. I don't know what direction I should go in. I don't want to end up like my mom. She never got to do what she wanted to do in her life. She should have been a writer. She should have traveled. But if I quit SII now, am I throwing away an opportunity to eventually make more money, get more skills, and all that stuff? What if my video really sucks? Then I'll just be a stripper. And I'll have to explain this gap on my straight job resume if I'll ever want to work in an office again. And I don't want to be struggling when I'm my mom's age. But I want to make films. And I guess I have to struggle for a while to do that. But then again, maybe I'll just end up struggling forever. God, who wants to see another movie about strippers anyway?", "input": "", "output": "You are thinking about your life and your future, that's good. But I wouldn't advise making any major life changing decisions while under stress. Why don't you find out if Scott recognized you first?"}, {"instruction": "Under stress...I can't imagine calming down right now. I'm having trouble sleeping. And yes, I'm doing speed. I told the whole story to Gabby, and we both snorted a few lines together. Then I did more this weekend. That's another reason my face is such a mess--I pick more when I'm doing speed.", "input": "", "output": "Lisa..."}, {"instruction": "I know! Okay, it's stupid to take speed while all this other stuff is going on. I'll stop. I'll stop. I know it makes it worse. I think I like the glamour of making it worse. Maybe I want to impress Gabby by freaking out and losing my job at SII. I think part of me wants to be a stripper addicted to speed!", "input": "", "output": "I hope that part of you doesn't win out over the next few weeks."}, {"instruction": "Can I call you if I'm just completely losing it, like if I actually talk to Scott?", "input": "", "output": "Of course."}, {"instruction": "We're out of time, right?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but definitely call me if you're having difficulties, and not just with Scott Collavito."}, {"instruction": "Okay.
