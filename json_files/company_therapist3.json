We will be talking intimately so\nit is silly to be so formal.", "input": "", "output": "I took some notes during our phone conversation. I would\nlike to start by going over them with you, if you don't mind..."}, {"instruction": "Not at all.", "input": "", "output": "It would help me understand the situation a little better\nif I had some of your history. You said that you are 38 years old and\nwere born in France."}, {"instruction": "Actually I spent my childhood there and moved to United\nStates with my parents and brother in 1970.", "input": "", "output": "That's makes you about 12 years old at the time of the\nmove."}, {"instruction": "That's right.", "input": "", "output": "What part of the US did your family settle in?"}, {"instruction": "My parents visited San Francisco on their honeymoon, and\never since then they always wanted to live here. When we finally made the\nmove, there was never a question of the final destination.", "input": "", "output": "And how was it for you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, my teenage years were in San Francisco during\nthe decline of the Flower Power. It was definitely an interesting place\nto be for a little French girl.", "input": "", "output": "If you don't mind, what do you parents do or did?"}, {"instruction": "My mom is a chef and worked in a small restaurant in Paris.\nWhen she and my dad moved to the Bay Area, they started their own place.", "input": "", "output": "Do they still?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes. Of course it is much different now. My mom spends\nonly two days a week at the Gardens. She and my dad like to travel.", "input": "", "output": "During our telephone conversation, you mentioned that\nyou were married and are having some problems with your husband."}, {"instruction": "Some problems. Yeah, I guess that's right. Some problems.\nI was married to Tom for seven years. When we first met it was like a dream.\nWe both liked the same things. Voted the same way on the political issues.\nEven my parents liked him a lot. I guess the main problem developed when\nI decided that I did want to have children after all.", "input": "", "output": "You did not want children at first?"}, {"instruction": "We both thought that the world was too over populated and\nthere were enough little children and someone had to do the work and keep\nit all going. Now it all sounds kind of childish but at the time...frankly,\nI think we were too scared or egotistical or selfish to have children.", "input": "", "output": "What changed your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Time, I guess. I grew older and realized that being an\neditor, even for a big city daily newspaper like The Chronicle, just wasn't\nwhat it is all about. Not that I had a revelation about the meaning of the\nuniverse, but I knew that wasn't it and I felt that it had a lot to do with\nchildren. Some people would say my hormones were talking. But I think it\nis more than that. I spent most of my life pleasing myself and it felt like\nit was time to please someone else. Not in a sexual or intellectual way\nlike with Tom. But somehow deeper. I am not sure I could put it into words.", "input": "", "output": "You're doing fine."}, {"instruction": "When I confronted Tom with my revelations, well he...let's\njust say he did not take it well.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "He was a well established and respected businessman at\nthe time. He traveled a lot. And worked even more. There were days when\nwe would barely say hello to each other and we communicated through voice\nand e-mail. The idea of sacrificing all that for a child seemed too much\nfor him.", "input": "", "output": "Go on."}, {"instruction": "Oh, after a while he did agree to have a kid. Although\nour relationship suffered from that. But I decided to take it one thing\nat a time. First get pregnant, then have the baby, and then I figured our\nrelationship would get back to normal. Tom was a good man, he was bound\nto love his child.", "input": "", "output": "So what happened?"}, {"instruction": "We made love a lot. I even came to his office one afternoon.\nBut six month went by, and then a year. I started to get worried. Sex became\nmore like work. Tom become more irritable. He spent even more time, if it\nis possible, traveling. I finally decided it was time to seek professional\nhelp. I talked to my regular doctor first. She scheduled me for all sorts\nof tests. I didn't want to get Tom involved, so I just went by myself.", "input": "", "output": "What did you learn?"}, {"instruction": "That I was perfectly fine. My body was ready and willing\nto have children.", "input": "", "output": "So it was Tom."}, {"instruction": "That was the common belief.

So I had to talk to Tom.", "input": "", "output": "How did he take it?"}, {"instruction": "He was strange.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well you would think a man, even if he did not want to\nhave children, would not take the news of his inability well. But he just\nshrugged it off and even made a joke about it.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe he was just trying to hide his true feelings from\nyou?"}, {"instruction": "Tom? No. It was weirder than that.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "About two years ago when I first started to talk about\nhaving kids, Tom went on a one week business trip to New York. I\noffered to go with him. It would have given me the opportunity to see some\nfriends as well. But Tom said that he would not have any time and he would\njust feel more stressed and guilty for leaving me in the hotel room by myself\nday after day. I would have had to beg off from work anyway, so I stayed\nhome. He called me a couple of time from New York. I thought he was kind\nof distant, but I just attributed it to stress and being away from home.\nSleeping on a strange bed and all. When he returned, he was sick and very\ntired. I figured it was a cold that you get from flying in airplanes. No\nbig deal. In a week or two he was perfectly normal and I did not give it\nanother thought.", "input": "", "output": "It wasn't a cold?"}, {"instruction": "You are very perceptive, Doctor. And a good listener too.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you."}, {"instruction": "It wasn't a cold. Tom had had a vasectomy.", "input": "", "output": "How did you find out?"}, {"instruction": "It's a small world. Even smaller when you get into infertility\nproblems. Last week I was talking with one of the women in my infertility\ngroup that I was using for moral support. She had a brother-in-law who was\na urologist in private practice in New York. Tom's name came up and, well,\nI found out.", "input": "", "output": "So it wasn't a business trip that Tom went on?"}, {"instruction": "No it wasn't. It seems that Tom planned ahead. Like\nhe always does.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do when you found out?"}, {"instruction": "I confronted him with it. I wanted him to deny it. But\nhe just stood there. I knew it was true.", "input": "", "output": "How are you now."}, {"instruction": "Well, sometimes I want to kill him. Sometimes, I'll\njust lie there feeling sorry for myself. It seems like such a betrayal.\nAnd those last two years when he knew the monthly agonies I was going through--was\nI pregnant or not. Now I keep getting these anxiety attacks. My heart beats\nfast. I cannot breath. My stomach hurts. I feel sort of dizzy. And I can't\nsleep. When I see him I want to rip his face off. He just looks at me with\nbig, sad eyes. He keeps saying that everything was fine before my hormones\nkicked in. But he feels cold, like a stranger to me. I think I want a divorce.\nBut I thought I needed to talk to someone first. I know I'm not rational\nright now.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you're handling it pretty well."}, {"instruction": "Really? Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "But handling it is about how you seem to the outside world.\nWhat we deal with here is how things are on the inside. Maybe trying to\nsmother your feelings right now is not the healthiest thing for you. Maybe\nwe should work on releasing your rage. I know that you were kidding when\nyou said that you wanted to kill your husband, but I think you were maybe\nonly half kidding. If we can get you to understand your feelings here, maybe\nyou wouldn't feel the need to express your anger towards your husband physically.\nYou also have some physical symptoms that I think we can control with some\nmedication. I'm going to give you a prescription and I want to hear\nfrom you after two doses as to how they are making you feel. If they aren't\nworking, we can easily switch to another medication."}, {"instruction": "You really think drugs are the answer?", "input": "", "output": "They certainly aren't the whole answer. But they will\nhelp with your anxiety attacks and get you to sleep at night. I can give\nyou some literature about the medication."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I want to see you again in a couple of days. How about\nThursday, the 18th in the afternoon?"}, {"instruction": "I have a meeting scheduled then. How is Friday for you.", "input": "", "output": "I don't see patients on Friday. Can we pick another time\non Thursday?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I can skip lunch. I'm not eating anyway. How about\nnoon?", "input": "", "output": "Noon will be fine. I'll see you on noon on Thursday,\nthen. And give me a call tomorrow morning about how the drugs feel to you.\nIf something doesn't feel right about the drugs, you can get ahold of me,\neven after hours. Just call here and the service will page me."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello. Please sit down. So how were the last couple of\ndays? Do you feel any effects of the drug?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Doctor. I think so. I have been sleeping a lot better. I'm\nalso feeling more together at work. I seem to get more done and my concentration\nis a lot better.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Sounds like this is working for you."}, {"instruction": "Somewhat. I still feel that strange separation between\nmy emotions and...I'm not sure how to put it right. I sort of feel like\nI can observe myself from the side. When I get upset, I now note to\nmyself: \"Oh. Feeling rather bad at the moment. Interesting. I wonder\nwhat triggered that on.\" I feel the feeling but I am also detached\nfrom it in some sense. I'm not sure I like that. But I do like the feeling\nof getting some sort of control over my life. I went to see a lawyer.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I just needed to know my options.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "Let's not talk about that right now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. You were starting to tell me about your current\nrelationship with Tom. You mentioned that he thinks that he is doing everything\nfor your own good."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Isn't that interesting? Tom's been talking with\nmy mother. Telling her how he is just trying to protect me from myself.\nThat I'm really too old to have children now and he doesn't want me to\ngo through what his sister did. She got pregnant at thirty-eight and about\nfive months into it found out that it was a Down's syndrome kid. She had\nan abortion and a nervous breakdown. She lost her job. And now she and Kent\nare maybe splitting up. So you can see how my mother could easily transfer\nthe whole situation of my sister-in-law onto me. Especially when Tom is\nquoting statistics to her. Tom is so good at convincing everyone that he\nis right. I think that that is his major talent. That's how he got as far\nas he did in business.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk with your mother?"}, {"instruction": "I tried. We spoke about a week ago. But as you could see\nfrom seeing me last time, I was in no form to argue with anyone. Especially\nmy mother. Maybe in my new Zoloft state, I would be better at it. I am\ncertainly surprising Tom.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, in different ways. I don't break down in tears during\nour conversations. In fact, I can get so cold now during talking with\nhim that he starts to get emotional. I think I am getting him worried.\nHe probably thought that he would be able to talk and ride himself through\nthis whole thing and come up on top.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean by \"on top?\""}, {"instruction": "Winning has always been very important to Tom. Being the\nbest at everything. He graduated at the top of his class from Columbia University.\nThen went on and got his MBA with honors. We met in New York. He was in\nhis last year for his MBA and I was finishing up my double degree in journalism\nand psychology at NYU. We were both driven perfectionists. We both wanted\nto be the best at what we do. I guess it was then that we decided not to\nhave children, they would have interfered with the lifestyle we envisioned\nfor ourselves. Now it all seems so stupid.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that Tom considers the current situation\nas something that he needs to win? To come out on top of?"}, {"instruction": "You are beginning to understand him. It is definitely what he\nthinks. His poor wife had temporary delusions about parenthood and children.\nHe was there to prevent a terrible mistake. And now his job is to get me\nwell and back to normal again. And all of this with a minimum of interruptions\nto his busy work schedule. I don't think so.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing, Doctor. I'm just talking.", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned that you are getting Tom to be emotional."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. Last night when I came home, he was there. But\nunlike other nights, I was civil with him. I said hello, asked if he had\ndinner yet. I was able to maintain my cool and to distance myself enough\nfrom my emotions and feelings not to show them to Tom. He was taken aback.\nThen I took a long bath. I left the door open. I wanted Tom to see me naked.\nI'm not sure why I did it. But it felt really good to know that he was looking\nat me, even though I didn't actually catch him doing it. I know he was.\nThen I just wore this light cotton nightgown to bed. Nothing else. I knew\nit would turn Tom on to see me in it. I wanted him to want me a lot.", "input": "", "output": "How did Tom react?"}, {"instruction": "He noticed. But he didn't touch me. Needless to say, we\nstopped having sex when I found out about his indiscretions with the urologist.\nThis morning, I got dressed in front of him. I gave him the whole show.\nHe kept pretending that everything was as usual. But he was looking. I could\nsee him from the corner of my eyes in the mirror. I took off my nightgown\nby letting it drop at my feet and got into the shower. When I came out,\nI carefully dried myself with a towel, bending down and stretching to carefully\nabsorb every drop of liquid from my body. Then I walked into our bedroom\nand put cream on my arms, legs, and thighs. I put on a very sexy pair of\nunderwear. With all the weight that I lost, it really looks great on me\nnow. I don't know if you can tell, Doctor, but I am not wearing a bra.\nTom knows. I know he was shocked that I would go to work like this. But\nhe didn't dare say a word. I wished him a good day and left.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think you acted like this?"}, {"instruction": "I wanted him to want me. To want me and not be able\nto have me. I want him to think of me all day today. I want him to go crazy\nand lose his concentration. I want to feel on top for awhile.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like you are on top?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Doctor. More than you might think.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't go to work today.", "input": "", "output": "I thought you had meetings all day today.

This morning?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Where?"}, {"instruction": "At Starbucks down the street.

A little. Richard and I shared a table. I saw\nhim sitting alone, and invited myself to join him. He said that he was\ndelighted but surprised.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently he works for SII too and had seen me on few\noccasions around the building.

From where you are sitting you should\nbe able to see a part of my left nipple. I made sure before I came into\nthe room that you could.", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Bows, are you sure you are feeling all right?"}, {"instruction": "In some ways, Doctor, I never felt better. Would you like\nto know what happened next?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Richard and I got our drinks to go and went back to\nhis place. Should I go on?", "input": "", "output": "If you like."}, {"instruction": "Richard has a beautiful body. He reminds me of Tom about\nten years ago.", "input": "", "output": "Hmmm."}, {"instruction": "He made me feel beautiful, and sexy, and very desired.\nDo you think it was wrong of me?", "input": "", "output": "It's not my job to judge your actions, Sylvia. But I am\na bit concerned over what seems to be a major change in your behavior since\nyou started the Zoloft. Maybe we should adjust your dosage."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, it's not the medication. I just feel that I need\nto take control now. And if having sex with strangers is part of it, then\nI think that's okay. I never let myself have this kind of freedom before\nand I think I need to experiment a little now.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, I'm just worried about you. I want to make sure that\nyou are fully aware of all of the consequence of your actions. I don't want\nyou realize later that you made a mistake."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry, Doctor. I won't blame you.", "input": "", "output": "That's not what I'm saying. I just want you to be sure\nyou are doing this because you really want to and not because of some medication."}, {"instruction": "As I said, don't worry Doctor. I know what I'm doing. And\nI think you are doing a wonderful job with me so far.", "input": "", "output": "I hope so. Let's set up our next session. I would like\nto see you next Tuesday. Can you make a 4 pm appointment?"}, {"instruction": "I am learning to make time for myself. I will be there, Doctor.\nAnd thank you so much for worrying about me. But I am really okay. Goodbye,\nDoctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia. And don't hesitate to call me over the\nnext few days if you feel the need."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Sylvia. Please sit down. So do you want to talk\nabout this weekend?"}, {"instruction": "Wow. Right to business. Well, I would like to give you\nthis first. This is my family tree. When Rene and I spent the night\ntogether, we talked about our past and about our families and our futures.\nWhile we talked, we made collages out of the old magazines the hotel had\naround. They are supposed to represent portraits of Rene and me, my brother,\nmy mother and father, and Rene's father--my uncle. We took some artistic\nlicense in coming up with these images. I think there's some emotion in\nthere too. Yesterday, I took them to work and scanned them in to produce\na short computer version. I brought you a disk. I thought you might want\nto take a look at it.", "input": "", "output": "I would, indeed."}, {"instruction": "There is also some text with each image. Most of it I wrote.\nBut some sections have been heavily influenced by Rene. I think it is obvious\nwhere her contributions are.", "input": "", "output": "I'll take a look at it tonight. Unless you would like\nme to take a look right now?"}, {"instruction": "No, tonight is just fine and I think that now we have some\nimportant things to discuss. I know that you're worried about the effect\nthat Zoloft has had on me.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Zoloft can have some behavioral side effects. I have\nsome concern that recent changes in your behavior could be caused by the\ndrugs rather than by events in your life."}, {"instruction": "I have to say that after seeing Rene and her reaction to\nme, I have some concerns, too. Well, not concerns exactly, but I guess I\nreally am a little different.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? How did Rene react?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Rene was surprised that I was so...so bold.\nShe thought I was bolder. Not just my actions but even my mannerisms.\nShe didn't think it was a bad thing. Actually, she said it was kind of refreshing\nafter so many years of what she called \"corporate contamination.\"\nBut she did think it was different.", "input": "", "output": "When you're talking about actions, do you mean your affair\nwith Richard?"}, {"instruction": "Please understand, I don't regret anything I have done\nso far. In fact I think I needed some sort of catalyst to get my\ntrue self out in the open again. If Zoloft has been that catalyst, then\nall the better. You have to understand, Doctor, that living with Tom\nall these years has greatly altered my behavior and even personality. I\nused to be more daring in the past. I took more chances. I felt stronger\nabout things. I marched for causes I believed in and wrote passionate articles\nwhich I hoped would change the world. I even got arrested once in a march\nand spent time in jail. I might have been over the top sometimes, but I\nalways gave all of my intellect and passion to the causes I fought for.", "input": "", "output": "You said there was a change?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Because of Tom's urgings, I made career moves that,\nwhile intellectually challenging, were more and more devoid of emotion and\nsocial content. When I was a technology reporter, I wasn't a techno-geek\nlike so many of my colleagues. I could report on advances in medicine along\nwith a new Nintendo model, so there was a sense that it was still partly\nfor the public good, somehow. I just wasn't part of the \"gee whiz\"\nschool of technology reporting. But then I got this job offer that Tom insisted\nI take...the pay raise was huge...and I moved into the private sector. But\nit's hard for me to get very passionate about a circuit board. Personally\nI don't get too teary-eyed about advances in computer gaming technologies.", "input": "", "output": "So you're saying that by moving away from journalism and\nthe political causes of your youth, you felt a lack of public service?"}, {"instruction": "I guess what I'm saying is that these sessions have made\nme realize that there is something that I was missing in my life.\nI don't know if it is public service, because I think that my decision to\nhave children is also a consequence of feeling this emotional void. Really,\nI think it is trying to have a purpose in life, sort of a reason for\nexisting. My purpose for doing things has changed. Perhaps my behavior\nlast week was a bit too much of a change all at once. But I think I can\nhandle it now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "By the way, I felt bad about that nipple thing last\nweek. It was very naughty of me. I guess that I was just trying to\nshock you a little. I promise to behave better in your company. I really\nlike you, Doctor, and I'm surprised just how important it is to me that\nyou have a good opinion of me.", "input": "", "output": "I think very highly of you, too. And it's natural that in\nthe course of these intimate conversations that you are concerned about\nhow you come across. Because in therapy you are opening up who you are in\na very fundamental way to another person. That can be really frightening,\nin addition to very rewarding. And when you have shared yourself at that\nlevel, it's important not to feel rejected. So believe me when I say that\nyou are really a very sensitive, intelligent, and warm person for whom I\nhave the greatest measure of regard."}, {"instruction": "Wow. Thank you very much, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Now, bringing out your emotions and getting in touch with\nyour feelings is important. But I'm still not convinced about your ability\nto handle the medication. I'd be very unhappy if the drugs were responsible\nfor changes in your behavior that you later regret when the drug has worn\noff."}, {"instruction": "I really think that the drug's major effect has been\nto make it possible for me to get some perspective and be able to see my\nlife sort of from the outside. I don't want to give that up now. I don't\nthink it is an aphrodisiac or something.", "input": "", "output": "Look, if it's important to you, I am willing to give\nit another week or so, but please let me know of all the changes in\nyour behavior and feelings. I want you to be able to enjoy your emotions\nand feel in control of your life without long term dependence on any medication.\nYou have a very strong character and a lot of will power. I believe that,\nthrough our sessions, you'll be able to achieve the same perspective as\nyou can with Zoloft."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor. I'll be good.", "input": "", "output": "I'll let that pass. Now, I gather Rene has been a great\ninfluence in your life. Would you like to talk about your relationship with\nher?"}, {"instruction": "You're right, Doctor. Rene has been a strong force in my life.\nHer mother died in a terrible car accident when Rene was only five.\nUncle Phillip, her father, took her death very hard. I think he might have\nblamed himself for what happened. He owns a vineyard in the South of France.\nDuring one of the local wine festivals, he got a really bad flu. So Aunt\nAngelina took his place in representing their winery during a wine tasting\nat the festival. It has always struck me how little things can lead to catastrophic\nconsequences. When she was ready to come home, her car wouldn't start. It\nwas something that Phillip had dealt with before by taking the car a couple\nof times to a mechanic in town and getting it fixed, but they never really\nquite got it. Anyway, the car wouldn't start so someone at the festival\noffered to give her a ride home. He turned out to be drunk and lost control\nof the car. Ironically, the driver was basically fine, but Aunt Angelina\nbroke her neck. I was only two, but it was really hard on all of us. After\nthat, Rene used to live with us in Paris during the school year and, in\nthe Summers, Rene and I would go and live with Uncle Phillip at the vineyard.", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned you had a brother."}, {"instruction": "My brother wasn't born yet. Jeorge is five years younger\nthan me.", "input": "", "output": "So Rene and you were close since early childhood?"}, {"instruction": "Rene was..is three years older than I am. In the beginning,\nI thought of her as a grown woman. When she first came to live with us,\nI was only about two. I have vague memories of when Aunt Angelina died.\nI remember my Papa crying and my Mother's face. Aunt Angelina's funeral\nwas in April. At that time of year, there are no leaves on any of the vines\nand they just look like a bunch of scary sticks. I remember being scared\nof the vines. They were black, gnarled, and disfigured. I also have\na memory of Rene tickling me on my feet, unmercifully. I guess it was that\nfirst summer she spent with us.", "input": "", "output": "How old were you when you spent your first summer with\nyour Uncle?"}, {"instruction": "It was the next summer. I was almost four by then.", "input": "", "output": "You were very young to be without your mother for the\nwhole summer."}, {"instruction": "It was okay. Rene took good care of me. She sort of\nadopted me and even told me that she was my \"summer mother.\"", "input": "", "output": "So Rene was very protective of you."}, {"instruction": "Very! Still is.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about your relationship later on as you got older."}, {"instruction": "After a while we became best friends. We were inseparable.\nAlthough she never let me forget that she was older than me. By three whole\nyears.", "input": "", "output": "How did this difference in ages express itself?"}, {"instruction": "I think Rene thought that it was her job to experience\nthings first. She would decide whether something was a good or bad thing\nand, if she approved, she would share her knowledge with me and introduce\nme to whatever the new experience was. There were quite a variety of new\nexperiences which she approved of.", "input": "", "output": "For example?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, Rene taught me how to smoke. And how to hide the\nfact from my parents. Rene had sex first and thought it was her job to properly\nprepare me for the experience. Rene even arranged my first time.", "input": "", "output": "Did Rene's leadership bother you?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. Once, when I was in the fifth grade, I told\nRene that a boy in my class touched my breasts. She thought that it was\ntoo early for me to engage in this kind of activity. She went to my school\nand punched this poor boy out in front of everyone. I felt very humiliated.\nI didn't talk to her for a whole day.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like Rene still behaved like your mother-protector."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I guess that's true. But she also did a lot of things\nthat a mother wouldn't do.", "input": "", "output": "Like teaching you how to smoke?"}, {"instruction": "And how to kiss. And how to get high. I guess she was sort\nof a cross between a mother and an older sister.", "input": "", "output": "How old were you when you first tried illegal substances?"}, {"instruction": "Fourteen. I remember that it was quite an adventure.\nRene was visiting us in San Francisco. She was approached by this older\nguy who was selling some marijuana. She called me at home and told me she\nwas going with this guy to his boat, where he apparently kept his stash.\nShe called me to let me know just in case this guy killed her. She\nthought that he might try to dispose of her body in the river, weighted\ndown with stones. I told her that she was insane to go with him if she felt\nthis way. Rene laughed and said that she was exaggerating. But she did manage\nto mention that he was thin and blond in his thirties, that he limped, and\nthat he had a boat named Elizabeth. I think she was really scared, but\nshe was going to do it anyway. I was supposed to cover for her, but\nRene was gone the whole night and only came back at about four the next\nmorning. By that time, I was ready to tell everything to my parents and\ncall the police. The next evening, I smoked my first joint.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, nothing happened. I was expecting to really\nget stoned. Hallucinate and everything. But I didn't feel anything at all.\nIt was quite a disappointment. Rene said that it was just because\nit was the first time, and I guess she was right because it definitely\nworked later on.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, our time is up."}, {"instruction": "That's fine, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to schedule another appointment in a week. How\nis this same time and day next week?"}, {"instruction": "It's okay for me.", "input": "", "output": "All right, 4 pm on Tuesday, July 30th. And Sylvia,\nI want you to seriously examine your changes in behavior and at our next\nsession we will decide on your medication. Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Doctor. I'll do my homework.", "input": "", "output": "I'll take a look at your computerized family tree tonight.\nGoodbye, Sylvia. I know I always say it, but please feel free to give me\na call for any reason."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor. How are you today?", "input": "", "output": "Hello. I am very well, thank you. Won't you please sit\ndown?"}, {"instruction": "I am guessing that you are still wondering about Zoloft\nand me.", "input": "", "output": "I am not just wondering. I am concerned. You promised to\nkeep an eye on yourself and tell me about any changes in your behavior."}, {"instruction": "You would be happy to hear that I have been spending most\nof my time working. I took too much time off and things just piled up. I\ncarefully observed my behavior during meetings and when I worked by myself.\nI'm relieved to say that Zoloft didn't seem to result in any memory loss\nor changes in either my attention span or my ability to concentrate. So\nafter a week of careful observations, I'm convinced my ability to perform\nmy duties are unaffected by this medication. Of course, I acknowledge\nthat this is just my opinion. But it is hard to be completely objective\nwhen you are the laboratory rat as well as the scientist. But seriously\nDoctor, I don't think that my cognitive functions have been adversely effected.", "input": "", "output": "I noticed that you are emphasizing your work life in\nyour analysis. How about your personal life?"}, {"instruction": "You're right Doctor. I am. But there are a lot of changes\nin my personal life. Please keep in mind that Rene is here and my behavior\nwould have been altered in her presence with or without Zoloft.", "input": "", "output": "I'll keep that in mind. So tell me about the changes."}, {"instruction": "For starters, I've been spending most of my free time\nwith Rene. We went out this weekend to find her an apartment in the\nCity.", "input": "", "output": "She's planning to move to San Francisco?"}, {"instruction": "She's not sure yet. But she would like to spend a few months\ndown here and it seems silly and expensive to stay in a hotel. Ordinarily\nshe would stay with Tom and me, but...it's much better this way.", "input": "", "output": "Did you find anything?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. It's not finalized yet. But I think it will\nwork out. It's a small two bedroom apartment on top of Pacific Heights.\nFrom the living room and kitchen windows you can see most of the Bay. It's\nbeautiful! And it is also close to the Presidio.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds nice."}, {"instruction": "Yes. And I think it's in a good school district.", "input": "", "output": "Is that important?"}, {"instruction": "Rene has a twelve-year-old boy, Robert. He is a\nvery sweet kid even if a bit too serious at times.", "input": "", "output": "Is Robert with Rene now?"}, {"instruction": "Robert is with his grandfather, my Uncle Phillip.\nHe spends his summers at the vineyard just like Rene and I used to. Only\ndifference is that he really likes it. Robert wants to be a wine maker just\nlike his grandfather. Phillip couldn't be happier. At last he's found his\nsoulmate and a successor for the family business.", "input": "", "output": "Where is Robert's father?"}, {"instruction": "He died when Robert was just a baby.", "input": "", "output": "So Rene is a widow?"}, {"instruction": "I thought I told you that. Rene met Tad in New York. He\nwas mad about her. He wouldn't let anything stand between them including\nher boyfriend at the time. They got married and Robert was born six months\nlater.", "input": "", "output": "If you don't mind me asking, what happened to Tad?"}, {"instruction": "One day on the way to work he passed out in the car. The\ncar smashed into a tree on the side of the road. When he came to, the car\nwas smashed up but he was okay. But he went to see a doctor to find out\nwhy he passed out. A week later, he was diagnosed with an inoperable\nbrain tumor. He was dead in two months.", "input": "", "output": "It's a horrible story. I am very sorry."}, {"instruction": "Me too. I actually liked Tad. Most of the other men Rene\nassociated with were...well let's just say Rene doesn't go for the cerebral\ntype. But Tad was sweet and compassionate. It's a shame that Robert never\nhad an opportunity to get to know his dad.", "input": "", "output": "Are you close to Robert?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. He's becoming a teenage and it is hard to tell.\nBut when he was a baby, he was the most charming and possibly the cutest\nchild I have ever seen.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you love your nephew very much."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I do. I love the possibility of living in the same\ncity with him. He is very bright and I look forward to taking him to places\nlike the Exploratorium.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, I would like to get back to your self assessment\nof your behavior. You mentioned that in your personal life there has been\nsome major changes. I understand that the presence of Rene is a large change.\nIs there anything else?"}, {"instruction": "Now Doctor, this is where I want you to have an open mind.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "As I said, I have been spending most of my free time with\nRene. This includes night times. As you can imagine living with Tom the\nlast couple of weeks has been anything but pleasant. Rene thought that I\nmight benefit from just taking a break and living with her for awhile. Frankly,\nI am surprised that Tom hasn't called you. He hasn't, right?", "input": "", "output": "No. Tom didn't call me since our last session."}, {"instruction": "Last week, I only spent one night at home. I just\ngot so angry at Tom for calling you and...I just needed to get some sleep.\nI think that I feel much better now partly because I don't have to go home\nand face him. Now I have the option of staying with Rene.", "input": "", "output": "You always had an option of leaving."}, {"instruction": "That's true. But it is much easier with Rene around. She\njust took charge, packed my bags, and told Tom that he has to cope without\nme for a while. This is not a permanent thing. But I think it is good for\nthe next couple of weeks or so.", "input": "", "output": "So you are planning to move with Rene into the Pacific\nHeights apartment?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. At least until Robert comes back from France.", "input": "", "output": "How is Tom taking this?"}, {"instruction": "I think he is partly relieved. I am surprised he didn't\ntake off on one of his business trips. I think he might have wanted to keep\nan eye on me or something. He hates it when things aren't under his control.\nBut with me acting cold towards him, I think it made him very uncomfortable.\nHe still thinks that he knows everything that goes on through my parents\nbut he doesn't have to deal with me on a day-to-day basis. I did tell you\nthat he has been talking with my mother almost every day?", "input": "", "output": "You mentioned that he was trying to convince your mother\nthat all of his actions were completely for your benefit."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Well, I think she is convinced. She was very effected\nby Tom's sister's tragic pregnancy story and all of its consequences. I\nthink she looks at me and sees Down's Syndrome, divorce, depression, and\nunemployment. She's very upset and Tom is taking advantage of it.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you talk to your mother again? You said you're\nfeeling better. Perhaps now it would be easier for you to express your point\nof view?"}, {"instruction": "I will. It's just not time yet.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I didn't tell you about all the changes yet, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I had two affairs last week.", "input": "", "output": "I think that qualifies as a big change in behavior."}, {"instruction": "Yes, it does. Remember about keeping an open mind.", "input": "", "output": "I remember."}, {"instruction": "The first was the evening after our last session. I came\nback to SII to pick up some papers because I wanted to do some work at home.\nI went into the copy room but the copy machine on our floor was out of order.\nSo I went downstairs to the engineering department. At six o'clock in the\nevening, the engineering department turns into a dinner party. Some of our\nengineers only get to work at this time. They say they can get more work\ndone at night when no one bothers them. They are an interesting and eccentric\nbunch of individuals. Some of them, when they have an exciting project,\nsleep on the floor under their desks. Rene was going on a photo shoot that\nnight, so since I wasn't seeing her I got talked into staying for pizza.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds innocent so far."}, {"instruction": "Yes. But there's this one young\nman, David. I have seen him in the past once or twice around SII.\nHe is very handsome and self assured. Not exactly the stereotype of a computer\nnerd. I'm not sure how it happened, but I ended up in his cubicle.\nDavid showed me his latest project. It was good. He clearly had some artistic\ntalent as well as being a good programmer. When I leaned over him to see\nthe computer screen better, I could feel his breath on my breasts. It was\nvery exciting. I moved in closer so his face touched my skin. He kissed\nme and then his hand started to slowly move up my legs. I was trembling\nand almost lost my balance. David held me up and I ended up in his arms.\nI wanted him so much then. We went up to my office and...well, Doctor, I\nam sure you understand what happened next.", "input": "", "output": "I do."}, {"instruction": "The second time was with\nRene. Last Friday I took her to work with me to show her SII. Somehow\nI just never had done that before although she had visited me in San Francisco\na couple of times since I started work there. She was only moderately interested\nand I decided to take her for lunch in a nearby restaurant. So there in\nthe restaurant, sitting by himself, was one of my freelance photographers.\nRene is also a photographer so I decided to introduce them. Matthew\nis very nice. He gave Rene his card and offered her his assistance in possibly\ngetting some freelance work from an advertising agency he was doing some\nwork for. Rene insisted that we all have lunch together. Matthew is very\nintelligent and witty and I was happy to have his company.", "input": "", "output": "So Matthew was next."}, {"instruction": "Yes, Doctor. You're very perceptive.", "input": "", "output": "Was it just you and Matthew or..."}, {"instruction": "It was the three of us in Rene's hotel room.", "input": "", "output": "Had you and Rene ever done this before?"}, {"instruction": "Once, when I was still going to NYU, Rene and I made love\nto one of her artist friends.", "input": "", "output": "So I am safe in assuming that this is a large deviation\nfrom your normal, pre-Zoloft, behavior?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Doctor. But it is not abnormal behavior. It might\nbe a bit unusual for me, but I want this. I want to break out of my\nday-to-day life. I want to experience and feel things that are different\nand new. And, what is most important, I like this. I like feeling the\nexcitement of seduction. It's wonderful and I had almost forgotten about\nit with Tom. Before I knew about Tom's vasectomy, our sex lives were very\nmuch centered around getting pregnant. At least it was for me. Sex almost\nbecame like work. Now it is as if I am rediscovering sex. But rediscovering\nit as an adult who is confidant of her looks and herself and has none of\nthe hangups that adolescence burdens us with. I hope you understand, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I understand that this is very exciting. But this is not\nproper behavior for..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor! You surprise me.", "input": "", "output": "You surprise me, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Tell me Doctor, if I were a man would you respond the same\nway?", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "I don't think you would. It's okay for men to have sex\nand have sex with multiple partners and to pick women up at bars and restaurants.\nRight?", "input": "", "output": "I think it is sometimes okay for men to do this. But..."}, {"instruction": "I think it is okay for me to do this right now. It's good\nfor me psychologically. And anyway, Doctor, we are out of time. How about\nmeeting the same time next week?", "input": "", "output": "Same time next week? Wait a second, Sylvia. While there\nis a double standard which I recognize is unfair, that is not at all what\nwe are talking about here. If a man came in here who had been monogamous\nfor years and I prescribed a drug which suddenly caused that man to completely\nchange his sexual behavior and begin engaging in sexual experiments with\nmultiple partners, sometimes at once, I would be concerned in exactly the\nsame manner as I am with you. I might be a bit old fashioned in my views\nin general, but this is not about your gender. This is about a drug which\nmay be causing an unintended side effect."}, {"instruction": "But a desirable side effect, in my case. Look, if you gave\na man some drugs to cure depression, say, and it also increased his sexual\ninterest...or let's make it easy, how about if it cured his acne. It might\nbe an unintended side effect, but you wouldn't discontinue the drug just\nbecause it had an unexpected, but desirable, side effect would you?", "input": "", "output": "I'm going to have to think about that. I guess in some\ncases an increased sexual appetite could be a desirable side effect, but\nI'm not sure that you are getting what you really need from these relatively\nmeaningless sexual encounters."}, {"instruction": "No, you're wrong there, Doctor. I know for a fact that\nI'm getting precisely what I need.", "input": "", "output": "Well, if you like the drug I'm not going to discontinue\nit right now. And I do appreciate your being honest with me about the behavior\nchanges that you are noticing. I know that it would be easier to just lie\nabout your various encounters and assuage my suspicion. But I would like\nyou to continue monitoring the drug's effects. If you ever feel like you\nare following a compulsion over which you don't have full control, then\nwe will have to stop the drugs right away. So let's pick up our conversations\nnext week, okay? Will you be staying with Rene?"}, {"instruction": "I think so.", "input": "", "output": "Can you please call and leave me you new telephone number\nwhere I can reach you, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Of course, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia. I'll see you on Tuesday, August 6th\nat 4 pm, then."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Sylvia. Won't you please sit down? How are you\ntoday?"}, {"instruction": "I'm well. Actually I'm a little tired. How are you?", "input": "", "output": "I'm fine, thank you. I haven't heard from you. Have\nyou moved in with Rene yet?"}, {"instruction": "I did help her move last weekend. She got her roommate in\nNew York to send her some stuff over. But she still needed a lot of the\nbasics. We went out and got her some furniture--two beds and a table. And\nI also had some chairs and a dresser in storage. So we did a lot moving.\nBut it looks very nice. Rene is very good at taking a place and making it\nfeel like it was lived in for years.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like it was a lot of work. So are you moving in\nthis week?"}, {"instruction": "I've been thinking about it. And I think I'll just visit\nher a lot. Tom and I are getting very good at avoiding each other. He\neven moved into the guest bedroom. And frankly, Doctor, I love my house.\nI'm not willing to give it up.", "input": "", "output": "Have you come to any decisions about your relationship with\nTom?"}, {"instruction": "You mean am I getting a divorce? No, I want to wait.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I understand why. Are you still in love with\nTom and interested in working it out?"}, {"instruction": "No. I'm not sure I can fully express or describe what\nmy feelings for Tom are. But they are definitely not love.", "input": "", "output": "Then why? What are the factors going into your decision?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not saying this is what I want to do forever. But right\nnow I just want to have things stay still for a bit.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I want to keep things just the way they are for a little\nwhile longer. I know that's puzzling to you. But please be patient with\nme. I have my reasons even if I want to hold off discussing them with\nyou for now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Do you have any drug reaction observations for me?"}, {"instruction": "You'll be happy to know that I have not had an affair\nin a whole week.", "input": "", "output": "This is not about my happiness, Sylvia. You know that I'm\nvery concerned. I'm giving you medication that apparently radically alters\nyour behavior."}, {"instruction": "I do understand, Doctor. I constantly monitor to see\nif what I'm doing is compulsive rather than based on my desires and rational\nthought. If I'm a slightest bit unsure of the origin of my motivations,\nI stop myself until I'm sure. But I have to tell you that it has not happened\nyet.", "input": "", "output": "You mean there hasn't been a situation when you felt that\nyour behavior might be as a result of medication? I think it is difficult\nto reconcile that with the vast behavior changes you've experienced in the\nlast couple of weeks."}, {"instruction": "Oh there are lots of things that I do that are the result\nof Zoloft, I think. I'm much calmer. I sleep much better. I am more self\nassured. The list just goes on. But I know you're asking about my sex life.\nAnd I am very confidant and sure about my decisions. In fact, even more\nso now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry?"}, {"instruction": "I ran into Richard again last week. Remember Richard?", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, he was the Starbuck's guy."}, {"instruction": "Yes. We had lunch together last Friday. It was sort of\nan accident really. I literally ran into him in the parking lot at work.\nI didn't hurt him but I destroyed his lunch. He said that he liked pressed\nchicken but was not sure about road kill. I felt so bad. But he said he\nwould forgive me if I'd take him out for lunch. We grabbed a couple of sandwiches\nand had lunch on a bench on the waterfront. We watched the boats, and the\npeople, and fed the birds with our leftovers. Last time we met, I didn't\nreally have a chance to get to know him. Richard is really a very interesting\nman. I think I told you that he works for SII. On Friday, I learned that\nhe is part of our think tank. His job is to figure out the future. He studies\ntechnological and sociological trends and tries to extrapolate them into\nthe future. He said that he sees the time when people will not even be able\nto comprehend what it's like not to be connected to the rest of the world\nvia the Web. I know the Internet is very big now, but he's talking about\nsomething much more, like personal information appliances that people will\nwear that will make them connected to the web all the time. Did you ever\nsee Star Trek, you know, the new one? Do you know the Borg? Well, Richard\nis talking about a kind of benign version: cyber people.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like Richard made quite an impression on you."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes. I think I would like to get to know him better.\nHe makes me feel very optimistic about the future. And he definitely makes\nme think in new ways. I remember when Tom and I used to talk like that.\nSometimes we would get so excited about a topic that we would stay up all\nnight talking. I really miss that.", "input": "", "output": "When did your relationship with Tom start to change?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure. It was so gradual. At first, even when we were\nvery busy, we always found time for each other. But then Tom got this job\nthat made him travel all the time. And somehow we started to drift apart.\nNothing really obvious, but we no longer knew everything about each other.\nWe didn't have time or energy to share each other anymore. And then when\nI changed professions, and the child issue, our relationship just started\nto unravel, I guess. The web of ideas and emotions that keeps people together\nhas to be in progress all the time or the links break or get old. We stopped\nspinning our web some time ago and just didn't notice it. I wonder how\nlong we would have stayed together even if Tom never did get a vasectomy.", "input": "", "output": "It doesn't sound like a good situation in which to have any\nchildren. Perhaps, in some sense, Tom was right about not having children."}, {"instruction": "I see what you mean. You think that Tom might have understood\nthat our relationship was flawed and his decision to get a vasectomy was\npartly based on that. No, I don't think that's right. Tom is basically\ntoo selfish. I think he had the relationship that he wanted. He had\na wife that he could introduce to his associates and not lose face. He had\na house that was mentioned in Architectural Digest. People enjoyed his dinner\nparties. I think he was happy with his situation and wasn't willing to change\nit. He thought that kids would cramp his lifestyle.", "input": "", "output": "Remember that you used to be in love with Tom. So there were\nthings about him that you found worthy of admiration."}, {"instruction": "When I met Tom, he was young and adventurous and emotional.\nBut even then there was this hardness about him. I knew that he was very\ncontrolling and arrogant even when I met him. And I identified with him\nsomewhat. I felt very driven and I always had a strong sense of being right.\nBut even though we possessed similar qualities, they've developed differently\nover the course of our lives.", "input": "", "output": "So you believe that at one point in your relationship\nyou were more similar. And with time you've grown apart."}, {"instruction": "Yes, essentially that's it. I'm really talking about character\ntraits. It's like Tom was seduced by the dark side of the force. When I\nwas talking with Richard, I was thinking how my life would have been different\nif I spent it with him.", "input": "", "output": "Do you regret your whole life with Tom?"}, {"instruction": "No, not exactly. But I was just thinking 'what if.' What if\nI met Richard ten years ago? What if I met Richard two years ago?", "input": "", "output": "Are you thinking that you might have had a relationship\nwith Richard? An affair?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I was thinking what a surprise it would have been for\nTom if I got pregnant about two years ago. I wouldn't have known that it\ncouldn't possibly have been Tom's. How would have he reacted? Would he have\ntold me?", "input": "", "output": "Tom was safe because of the kind of person you were. So\nthese hypotheticals are based on the situation after you found out about\nTom's vasectomy."}, {"instruction": "You're right. I never had an affair and never would have even\nif I met Richard and liked him. My relationships with men in the last\ncouple of weeks I don't consider affairs. I don't feel like I'm cheating\non my husband. Whatever our legal status is now, I don't regard Tom as my\nhusband anymore. I don't feel like I am doing anything wrong.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that you are acting out of revenge?"}, {"instruction": "No. Then I'd feel bad about making love to Richard, and to\nDavid, and maybe even to Matthew. I'd feel bad not because of Tom but because\nI was not sincere with these wonderful, intelligent, and charming men. Do\nyou understand?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Actually, Doctor, you will have to excuse me early today.", "input": "", "output": "Oh why?"}, {"instruction": "I have a date with Richard. We are meeting for an early\ndinner and then he is taking me to see the Phantom of the Opera. Do you\nbelieve in all these years I have never seen it?", "input": "", "output": "I saw it in New York and thought it was very good. I hope\nyou have a good time."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm planning on it. I'm wearing a tear-away suit.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Just kidding, Doctor! But I am hoping to stay out all night.", "input": "", "output": "Should we make our next appointment?"}, {"instruction": "Same time, same place?", "input": "", "output": "On Tuesday, August 13th at 4 pm, then."}, {"instruction": "Very good. Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia. Enjoy the show."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor. Nice to see you.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Sylvia. How are you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm very well, Doctor. I have to say again how pleased\nI am that you came on Saturday. I really didn't think you'd come. I\neven had a bet with Rene--she won.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry I lost your bet for you."}, {"instruction": "Oh, not at all. It was nice to see you as a person. You\nknow that in all the time I've known you, I've never seen your legs? I didn't\nrealize you were so tall.", "input": "", "output": "I want to thank you again. I really had a good time at\nyour Martian Party. I have to say, Sylvia, that you surround yourself\nwith a very interesting group of people."}, {"instruction": "I try. By the way, Rene really liked you. She said\nthat I did not exaggerate about you a bit--that you are as intelligent and\ncharming as I said. She also asked me to tell you that she would be very\npleased if you would ask her out for dinner.", "input": "", "output": "Uh..."}, {"instruction": "No, no, Doctor. Here's Rene's number. I'm putting it here\non the desk. So now you have her number and I'm just a messenger. You'll\nhave to talk to her yourself. Now to get back to me, I didn't introduce\nyou or tell anyone at the party that you're my therapist. I thought it wouldn't\nbe a good idea to stress our relationship, since my parents were there and\nI didn't want them to talk to Tom about you.", "input": "", "output": "I guess I'm glad, although I felt a bit awkward about\nit. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to move our conversation in another\ndirection. How was your week, Sylvia?"}, {"instruction": "It was very busy.", "input": "", "output": "Socially or professionally?"}, {"instruction": "Well, both actually. I have a couple of projects that we\nare about to ship and that's always hectic. And socially, let's see. After\nour last session, I went out with Richard. Dinner and The Phantom were\ngreat. We had a very good time. After the show we drove around the city\nin his little convertible Camaro. A very impractical car but a hell of a\nlot of fun. I love the city at night. It is such a jumble of lights and\nsounds and people and smells. When you drive around in a convertible, it's\nalmost as if you can just reach out and touch everything. Things are so\nright there. You have a feeling of being part of it. Experiencing the city\nthis way is almost intoxicating. And Richard understood how I felt. He took\nme everywhere. We saw the street walkers urging us on and the bridge lights\ntwinkling as the fog settled in. We even walked on the beach next to the\nold San Francisco air strip. Richard made me feel so young and carefree\nand happy. I'm disappointed that you didn't get a chance to meet him. I\ninvited him to the party but he couldn't make it.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps some other time."}, {"instruction": "Yes, perhaps. I guess it won't surprise you that we\nmade love that night.", "input": "", "output": "I think you even mentioned last time that it was part of\nthe plan."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes, the \"tear-away suit.\" Sorry, Doctor.\nSometimes I just get this uncontrollable urge to try and shock you.", "input": "", "output": "You made love to Richard. Was he the only one last week?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, now you shock me. Is that what you expect of me?", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be developing a pattern, Sylvia.

We actually met a number\nof years ago. I was still a reporter and I went to his studio in Sausalito\nfor an interview.

He insisted\nthat we have lunch together that same day. So we had lunch in a little French\nplace Le Central downtown.

Anyway, he asked me about Tom.", "input": "", "output": "What did you say?"}, {"instruction": "That we were having some difficulties and currently trying\nto figure out what we want to do.

It certainly wasn't true when I first met\nTom. I think we were very good together. We brought out each other's passions.\nBut it might be true now. Anyway, back to Bruce. When I was getting\nready to go home, Cassandra, my secretary, walked into my office\nwith a huge bouquet of yellow roses. Not from a florist, mind you. They\nwere freshly cut from someone's garden and wrapped in a newspaper. Cassandra\nsaid that there was a gentleman waiting at the reception desk. I came out\nto find a chauffeur in full uniform standing at attention and presenting\nme with a card. It said: \"Would you please do me the honor of having\ndinner with me. Bruce.\" This was not an invitation that I was willing\nto refuse, or wanted to, for that matter. We had dinner on a terrace\nof his studio.

We found that\na lot of our clients like to lean the manuals on the computer screens for\nsupport and use them to get directions for a particular task that they are\nworking on.

I guess it was very unprofessional\nof me. I know that the rule is never to have sex with any of one's employees.\nBut, he's a technical writer on my staff. We finished editing the final\nversion by eleven-thirty last night. Everyone had left by then. We were\njust going over the last bit he wrote over the weekend. We had a few changes\nand we had to redo a large section. We were both tired and hungry, we had\nskipped dinner, and I offered to buy him coffee before he went home. He\naccepted my invitation. We went to a diner around the corner. It turns\nout that he used to be an author and started to write technical manuals\nto support his family. I know how hard it is to break through in the writing\nbusiness. He told me some of his stories. I thought they were very entertaining--adventure\nmostly, the kind of stuff I used to read when I was nine or ten. But the\nstories had charm and were very compassionate. You know, I worked with this\nman for a long time and never really had the chance to get to know him before.\nI asked him if he needed a ride home--it was too late for public transit.\nHe said yes and then asked if I minded taking the long route home.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "I was happy to.

And how are you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm very well, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Shall we talk about your week?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, but  my week was hectic as usual.  The best thing that happened this week was the arrival of my nephew, Robert.", "input": "", "output": "How is Robert?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, he's great, thank you.  He is all grown-up.  He's looking forward to becoming a teenager.  He brought us some wine from my uncle's vineyard.  The wine is about two years old now and it is the first batch that Robert made himself.  He's very proud.  He kept talking about it.  He really is a good boy.", "input": "", "output": "Is he starting school here?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Rene has decided to stay in San Francisco awhile.  I'm not sure whether it will be forever, but she's giving it a go.", "input": "", "output": "Does school start soon?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  I think he starts eighth grade in a week or two.  I hope Robert likes his new school.  Robert grew up in New York in the same neighborhood since he was a baby.  Now he has to find all new friends...it's just going to be hard for him for a while.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure he'll be fine."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But I guess I'm just a worried aunt.  I'm thinking about taking him to SII on a tour and maybe trying to arrange some part-time job for him.  It would be fun to have him around.  He always lived so far away from me that I never got a chance to really get as involved as I would have liked.  But now...I'm just really looking forward to spending time with Robert and getting to know him better.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't realize you were so attached to your nephew."}, {"instruction": "Oh, more then that.  I think he is one of the reasons I changed my mind about having children.  I kept listening to stories that Rene would tell me about him and...well there was a lot of stuff.  But the most pronounced impression that I got from Rene was the feeling of being needed, of being essential to someone's very life, of being loved so completely and without reservations, and of loving someone back with such intensity.  I think these feelings are so primal, carefully developed over millenniums of evolution.  I think the only way for a human being to experience these feelings is to have a child.  I don't know if the emotions are the same in men.  So a man's reaction could be completely different.  But for a woman...I'm not sure I am making a lot of sense.  These are all the things that I feel and they are not really verbal.  This is what I mean when I say that I think this is all so instinctual.", "input": "", "output": "I think I understand."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I thought you would.  I watched Rene go through the experience of getting pregnant and having a child and I've seen him grow up.   In any case, I'm very happy he's here.", "input": "", "output": "How have you been feeling this last week?  You haven't mentioned eating and sleeping problems in a while.  I assumed you were doing better in that regard."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I think I'm stabilizing.  I think Zolax changed some of my eating habits.  I tend to eat more frequently but smaller amounts.  And I might require more sleep lately.  But these are all things that I could live with.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "And as I mentioned before, I think Zolax also allows me to take things more in stride.", "input": "", "output": "How do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well, for example I had this incident at work.  I think before I would have reacted quite badly.  But now...well let's just say I feel more in control of my situation and myself.  For example, last week I had another run in with Brenda Wolfe, Chief of Security at SII.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "About a month ago, I looked something up in SII's computer files.  No big deal.  No files were changed or erased.  I just needed some information.  Brenda confronted me with breaking into a restricted database.  I don't know how she found out it was me or how she knew the files were accessed, for that matter.  I told her at the time to just relax and let go of the whole thing.  No harm was done.  I thought the matter was settled.  Then, last week I get this memo, that she apparently sent out to the whole SII management, about the security issues and break ins.  She's going on about industrial espionage and theft.  This just made me furious.  She knew I did it.  I didn't deny it.  What an idiot!  I told her it was none of her business and she should just forget about it.  But I guess some people just need to feel powerful in what ever inconsequential ways they can.  And this way she can look really important.  But what I'm trying to say is that I think before I would have felt really anxious and upset about this whole thing.  Now, it's like a mosquito bite.  I can feel it but it's not such a big deal.", "input": "", "output": "I got a letter from Ms. Wolfe, too."}, {"instruction": "Oh?", "input": "", "output": "It specifically mentioned that the break in occurred in the medical records of SII personnel.  In particular, the files were searched for AIDs and HIV related information."}, {"instruction": "Well, you were wondering why I wasn't worried about AIDs.", "input": "", "output": "So you searched all of SII files to get the names of HIV infected..."}, {"instruction": "I wasn't going to risk my life, Doctor.  I want to have some sexual freedom but I'm not willing to die for it.  Is that wrong?", "input": "", "output": "This sentiment is not wrong.  But don't you think searching through everybody's personal records was an invasion of their privacy? How would you feel if this was done to you?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I wouldn't have been too thrilled.  But I didn't mean any harm.  And the men on my list are receiving a certain benefit that they all seem very happy about.", "input": "", "output": "So you have a list of men, cleared of HIV, with whom you're planning to initiate sexual contact?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, you are making me sound really bad.  I have never had sex with anyone that I later regretted.  I like all my men.  I find them smart and stimulating and sexy.  I am not just sleeping with them because they are healthy.  I just don't want to get into a sexual relationship which can put me in jeopardy.  That seems reasonable, doesn't it?", "input": "", "output": "So all the men you have slept with so far have been on this list?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, although the first time I had sex with Richard I didn't know his medical history.  That scared me, so the following day I did some research in the company files.  You know that there is this push for early HIV detection and everyone in SII is strongly encouraged to take the test, so it was really easy to find out who was okay and who...actually I'm happy to say there were very few who did not qualify, so to speak.", "input": "", "output": "So what is your plan?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "Are you planning to go through your whole SII list?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor!  I'm just being careful, that's all.", "input": "", "output": "But so far you had Richard, David, Hal, and a whole bunch of others.  I can't even remember their names now, there were so many."}, {"instruction": "They were all wonderful men, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "So you are saying you do not have a plan?"}, {"instruction": "What kind of a plan?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know.  A plan to have sex with all the eligible SII men."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, don't be silly!  I just had sex with a few men that I found attractive.  Attractive both spiritually and physically.  Trust me, I have no intention to to do the rounds, so to speak.  I'm just trying things out.  Really, Doctor, relax.  I'm not a crazed drug-induced nymphomaniac.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that.  But you do make me wonder, Sylvia.  I understand the need for experimentation, but I'm worried when the behavior of my patient goes so far from the norm, after taking a drug I prescribed.  And by the norm I mean the your normal behavior patterns, not something imposed on women generally--that argument just doesn't fly.  I really think we should reconsider Zolax."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, please...", "input": "", "output": "I would feel better if I knew for a fact that I'm not witnessing a Zolax side effect.  There are other serotonin reuptake inhibitors we could try, so that you could keep the positive benefits of the drug."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I'm sure that the drug isn't causing my behavior.  I don't know how to prove it to you beyond what I've already explained.  But I know what I'm doing.  I also know that what I'm doing could be perceived the wrong way.  But please, give me time to show you that you're wrong about the Zolax.  I know myself and I'm very sure of my intentions.  Please, I need time.", "input": "", "output": "How many affairs did you have last week?"}, {"instruction": "Two.  But it was with the same two man as before--Richard and Bruce.", "input": "", "output": "Do they know about each other?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  I never thought about it.  We never talk about this.  I don't think it's that important.", "input": "", "output": "You don't think they might have developed some expectations from your relationship?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I hope not.  I think we all know that we're doing this for fun.  I'm a married woman, for God's sake.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but you made it clear to them that isn't an issue.  I would assume that they think that you are either separated or getting a divorce."}, {"instruction": "I might have led them to believe this.  But not intentionally.  As I said before, I'm not ready to divorce Tom just yet.  Again, I feel that I need time to sort things out.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Sylvia.  Now our time is up for today.  Shall we meet the same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "I'd like that.  Doctor, please think well of me.  I have my reasons and I would like to discuss them with you some time in the future.  But, for now, just give me some time.  It's really important to me.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week, Sylvia.  That's August 27th at 4 pm.  Please take care of yourself."}, {"instruction": "I will, Doctor.  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.  How are you today?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Sylvia.  Fine, thank you.  And you?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, I'm tired.  I think I need to get away for a couple of days.", "input": "", "output": "You sound like you didn't have a good week."}, {"instruction": "I had a confrontation with my parents.  My mother in particular.  My Dad and I are just saying hello to each other and not much more then that.  I think he just doesn't know how to handle the whole situation.  I'm sure that he and my mother talk about me all the time.  But he just can't face me directly.  My mother, on the other hand, got brave last week and we sort of had it out.", "input": "", "output": "What did your mother have to say?"}, {"instruction": "A lot of things.  Mostly that she thought that I was making a mistake.  Her basic point was that Tom is not all that bad compared to other men.  She even went as far as telling me that she had to put up a lot with my dad.  And I know that's true.  Moving to the U.S. was definitely not her idea.", "input": "", "output": "You said that your mother had a successful business in Paris."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  She made a lot of sacrifices for my dad.  But that's her life and those are her decisions.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell her that?"}, {"instruction": "I tried.  But it's like we are from two completely different worlds.  I don't think that she could really understand what I'm going through even if she wanted to.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think your mother is trying to see your point of view?"}, {"instruction": "I know she loves me and is trying to understand me.  But there is this barrier.  People talk a lot about the generational gap, whether it's real or not.  I think that this might be that.  You have to understand that I think my mother is a very strong woman.  She was managing a business when most women were staying home and raising families.  Not that I think that staying home is bad.  That's not it.  It's just that I think that my mother was very progressive for her time.  There were not that many women running businesses back than.  For that matter, there are not that many now.  But somehow, our attitudes about life and living are different.  The ultimate life choices in our family were always made by my father.  There is this dynamic between them and my mother seems to be on the submissive side.  And all her life decisions and all her attitudes come from that perspective.  When Tom discussed his vasectomy with my mother, he kept stressing that that was a decision made for the benefit of our family and for my benefit in particular.  And my mother believed that he knew better.", "input": "", "output": "That Tom knew better than you what is ultimately good for the two of you as a family?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  She did not perceive what Tom did as cowardly, but as courageous.  He knew that I would be upset and furious and yet he did it anyway because he believed that that was the right thing to do.  I think that this is how my parents see the situation.", "input": "", "output": "Did you try to explain to your mother your point of view?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.  But as I said, I feel like there is this barrier between us.  I can not seem to get through to her.  And Tom is instigating my parents by telling them that I went insane and have drug induced behavioral problems.", "input": "", "output": "Do your parents know about your recent sexual activity?"}, {"instruction": "Somehow I just don't think that they would understand my interesting social life.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "If you're having difficulties with it, Doctor, then think of my mother.  Or father.", "input": "", "output": "So Tom never mentioned to them your..."}, {"instruction": "My indiscretions?  I don't think so.  I bet he doesn't think that it's in his best interests.  Although, I don't know what his plan is.  But he seems to leave me alone and that's all I want for now.", "input": "", "output": "And what about your parents?"}, {"instruction": "You mean Tom talking with them?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "I'll just deal with it later.  One thing at a time.  I'm sure I can work it out with them later.", "input": "", "output": "So you are just going to leave things with your mother the way they are?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  It takes a lot out of me to talk to her.  I just need some time.", "input": "", "output": "You keep saying that you need time, Sylvia.  But it is not clear to me what you are waiting for."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know.  For things to settle down a bit.  Maybe I should get away, even if only for a weekend.", "input": "", "output": "Where would you want to go?"}, {"instruction": "There is this little place down the coast.  It has a feeling of being nowhere.  It's a collection of cottages but each cottage is a treehouse.", "input": "", "output": "A treehouse?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  It's very charming.  The rooms are nestled in trees right on the coast.  And none of the rooms are rectangular.  They're all made up of strange angles and shapes.  There is something very soothing about being there.", "input": "", "output": "You were there before?"}, {"instruction": "About five years ago, Rene and I went down there for a week.

Well, as a matter of fact, he is.", "input": "", "output": "I think we should talk more about your list."}, {"instruction": "I thought we settled that last time.", "input": "", "output": "Not really.  I think we raised several ethical issues with you behavior.  Aside from the basic rights of these men to keep their medical records private, there were several others.  One of which is a consideration for these men's feelings.  You said that you are not worried about them because they know that you're a married woman."}, {"instruction": "I did think about it, Doctor.  And you are right.  I'm not really being fair with them if they are expecting to start and develop a relationship with me.  By the way, I only think that my actions could be misinterpreted and deemed unfair in regards to Richard and possibly Bruce.  The rest were strictly one night stands.  And I think it was clear from both sides that there were absolutely no expectations or follow-ups to be made.  But I do think that I might need to have a discussion with both Richard and Bruce.", "input": "", "output": "There are other issues as well."}, {"instruction": "I don't understand.  What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "You are having affairs indiscriminately without regard for these men's positions in the company."}, {"instruction": "Ah?", "input": "", "output": "I'll be more direct.  When you have sex with someone in your company whose corporate ranking is below yours, your actions could be misinterpreted as sexual harassment.  Did you ever consider that some man would feel like he couldn't say no to you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Look, I know it's possible, but this is really only an issue when a man is the boss.  Besides for that movie with Demi Moore, I've never heard of a woman as the harasser.  I bet the men would get laughed out of court.  And I would never force anyone to have sex with me.  Please Doctor, believe me when I say that all of the men I made love to so far were very willing participants.  And I don't think that any one of them regretted spending time with me.  Trust me, Doctor, I was there.  I should know.", "input": "", "output": "I just want you to keep in mind that you might be very difficult to refuse."}, {"instruction": "I will take that as a compliment, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I would rather you took it to heart and thought about it the next time you made a pick from your list."}, {"instruction": "I will, Doctor.  It is not my intention to hurt anybody.", "input": "", "output": "On that note, how was your week?  Socially, I mean."}, {"instruction": "I know just what you mean.  There were three, including Victor.  Victor is also from the Future group at SII.  He and Richard work together and this is one of the reasons that I will talk to Richard about our relationship.  Although I don't believe that I will break Richard's heart.  Richard has a very open mind when it comes to love and sex.  But you are right.  I would rather not have a misunderstanding.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Now how many men are in this Futures department?"}, {"instruction": "I cannot help if I find men with a high intellect sexy, Doctor.

I do think that it is probably best that way, too.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Our time is up now.

Did you get into the tree house place you were talking about?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Victor's sister came through.  Although we only got Sunday and Monday night.

We had a great time.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been friends with Victor long?"}, {"instruction": "It's hard to say.  I met him at one of the SII functions a couple of years back.

But how about them?  Did you tell Richard or Victor that they are on your safe list?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't think that telling them about my list was a good idea.  As open-minded as they are, they might not understand and could even be offended.  And I don't want that.  I want them to feel good.", "input": "", "output": "So how do you handle this situation?"}, {"instruction": "Since all of us have been tested recently, we all know.  As the moment approaches, I say that I would prefer not to use condoms, if they don't mind.  So far they have all volunteered the information about their HIV status.  They are the ones that tell me not to worry, and reassure me, and tell me to do what feels comfortable to me.  And I let them.", "input": "", "output": "That's a bit manipulative, don't you think Sylvia?"}, {"instruction": "Perhaps.  But I don't mind, they feel good, and I get to have sex the way I want.", "input": "", "output": "By the way, I don't remember if you told me or not, but what are you using for birth control?"}, {"instruction": "Why?", "input": "", "output": "Aren't you worried about getting pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I'm not worried, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Because I think I am.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I think I'm pregnant.  I haven't been to the doctor yet, but I peed on the stick and...", "input": "", "output": "Was this on purpose?"}, {"instruction": "What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "You mean you intentionally tried to get pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, you shouldn't be that surprised.  I did fuck everyone in sight.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, are you trying to shock me again?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I want you to be happy for me.", "input": "", "output": "I wish you told me what you were up to."}, {"instruction": "I couldn't.  I don't think I would have the guts to do what I did without the medication and I really do want to have a child.  I told you that during our first meeting.", "input": "", "output": "The medication!  You're not supposed to take this medication while you're pregnant!"}, {"instruction": "What?", "input": "", "output": "There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Zoloft intake in pregnant women.  Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response.  And from what I remember..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I need to know for sure.  Where are your references?", "input": "", "output": "Hold on.  Here is the PDR.  And I would also like to get on-line and check out the latest."}, {"instruction": "Give me the book.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, please calm down.  I will look it up right now.  Please sit down."}, {"instruction": "Oh god.  Please don't let anything be wrong with my baby.  Oh, Doctor, please hurry!  I've got to know.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  As I thought, there are no human studies.  Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 20 times and 10 times the maximum daily human dose.  There was no evidence of teratogenicity at any dose level. At doses approximately 2.5-10 times the maximum daily human dose, sertraline was associated with delayed ossification in fetuses."}, {"instruction": "Oh god!", "input": "", "output": "This is at extremely high dozes.  And from everything it says here, the effects of taking Zoloft during pregnancy is just not known.  Now, let's just slow things down here a bit.  How many weeks pregnant do you think you are?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I didn't care about that.  Oh god, I didn't even want to know.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, this is our ninth session together.  My records show that you've been taking Zoloft for only seven weeks.  What is the date of your last menstrual period?"}, {"instruction": "I have never been particularly regular.  My last period was just before I met you.  But it doesn't mean anything.  I could have been ovulating at anytime!", "input": "", "output": "So you are maximum seven weeks pregnant.  Do you have any idea of who the father is?"}, {"instruction": "No!  I didn't want to know.", "input": "", "output": "Well, this definitely explains your recent behavior.  What we need to do is get you to an obstetrician right away.  Do you know one?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  My gynecology group does obstetrics also.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Please see them as soon as possible.  I'll do some research too in the meantime. Sylvia, it's going to be okay.  I'm not an obstetrician, but a fetus at 7 weeks is generally not at risk of birth defects from these types of drugs.  If there's a problem, it is catastrophic and there would be a miscarriage.  You might have to worry about losing the baby, but you don't have to worry about some form of birth defect as a result of your previous intake of Zoloft.  From what I see here, the consequences of taking Zoloft during pregnancy are just not known.  And at the bottom it even says that for patients who require Zoloft it could be administered but under strict supervision."}, {"instruction": "Are you saying it is okay for me take Zoloft?", "input": "", "output": "No.  I would recommend that you stop taking it completely, now."}, {"instruction": "I agree.  It's just not worth the risk.  And it's served its purpose.", "input": "", "output": "Right.  You'll go get an obstetrician and we'll get his opinion on all this.  Now you had severe set of symptoms of post traumatic depression.  Zoloft was responsible for stabilizing your physical and mental symptoms.  After you stop taking Zoloft, I suspect that these symptoms will return.  If they return, I think we would need to figure out another medication."}, {"instruction": "No, Doctor.  I will handle whatever happens.  I would rather not jeopardize my baby.", "input": "", "output": "I don't want to do anything that would put your baby at risk.  But your symptoms included dramatic weight loss, insomnia, anxiety attacks, and loss of concentration.  All of those are not good for pregnancy.  I will work with your obstetrician to figure out the best therapy for you and your baby."}, {"instruction": "I would like to do some research, too.", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  I'll give you some references including Internet resources.  But before you come to any conclusions, please talk to me.  There is a lot of information out there.  It's quite complicated and not all accurate.  And any self diagnosis might lead to problems."}, {"instruction": "I understand.  But I would like to feel like I'm in some kind of control of the situation.  And I always believed that a person should try to be as informed about their medical situation as they can.", "input": "", "output": "That's a very sound attitude.  Now, you should start feeling the absence of Zoloft in the next couple of days.  Please monitor you symptoms and call me if you start to feel like you are starting to lose control or you notice new physical symptoms.  During the first trimester of pregnancy, you could be experiencing nausea, tiredness, urinary discomforts, unusual appetite tendencies.  It will be hard, at first, to sort out the true cause of your symptoms.  But with careful observation..."}, {"instruction": "I'm used to treating myself as a lab rat.  I got very good at running through my check list.", "input": "", "output": "Have you felt any pregnancy symptoms so far?"}, {"instruction": "I think so.  I'm unusually tired, especially in the early mornings.  I'm eating more and, when I get just a little bit hungry, I need food right away or I feel like I'm going to pass out.  I haven't experience any urinary discomforts yet.  And I only had two nausea spells so far.", "input": "", "output": "This all sounds perfectly normal."}, {"instruction": "That's what I thought too.  I have been reading a lot on this subject for years.", "input": "", "output": "That's good.  Now, you've mentioned that you not only don't know who the father is but specifically avoided knowing.  At some point you will begin to show and some of your men will notice.  Not to mention that Tom will notice.  What are your plans?  Are you going to tell Tom?"}, {"instruction": "Remember when I mentioned to you that I went to see a lawyer?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  In our first or second session.  You wouldn't tell me much more then that at the time."}, {"instruction": "I asked her what would happen if I got pregnant but was still married to Tom.  She said that under California laws, any child conceived during the marriage is legally recognized as the child of the husband.  This is regardless of any genetic issues.  So even though this child is not Tom's, Tom is still considered to be the father.", "input": "", "output": "You want Tom to be the father of your child?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I want Tom to be the legal parent of my child.  Of course, I will file for divorce as soon as I meet with my obstetrician.", "input": "", "output": "You mean you just want Tom to be responsible for the child financially?"}, {"instruction": "I think it is appropriate for Tom to have this responsibility.  Don't you?", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "He lied to me, Doctor.  His lie could have cost me my motherhood.  My little indiscretion is nothing compared to that.  Besides, he agreed to have a child two years ago, the bastard!  And if he wanted it to be his, he shouldn't have had the vasectomy.  Now, he will have all of the responsibility and none of the fun.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia!  I..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, it's okay.  I'm just still very angry and wasn't really able to talk about it with anyone including you.  I will file for total custody of the child.  Not to mention the story he could tell to his friends and associates.  I'm sure they will all be very sympathetic to him.  I've found the best divorce attorney in the state and I'm going to bleed him dry, the bastard!", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, you sound very bitter."}, {"instruction": "I'll get over it.  I now have what I wanted.  Actually if I don't think of Tom, I'm very happy.  Now I just need to figure out the Zoloft problem.  But you have put my mind at ease somewhat.  If there were women that had to take Zoloft during pregnancy and there were complications, I'm sure it would have been mentioned even as anecdotal evidence.  Since the PDR doesn't mention that, it makes think that it's not really all that bad.", "input": "", "output": "I still would like to do more research and talk to your obstetrician."}, {"instruction": "Of course.  I'm insisting that you do.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Our time is up now.  Please give me a call after you see your obstetrician and I would like to arrange to speak with him."}, {"instruction": "No problem, Doctor.  I'll e-mail you the information tonight.  What's your e-mail address?", "input": "", "output": "I'm CBalis@SIIComputers.com.  Thank you.  I would also like for you to call me in the next couple of days just to check on how you're feeling.  I do think that you might have to continue taking an antidepressant of some sort.  And I'll discuss this with your obstetrician."}, {"instruction": "Nothing that would harm my baby.", "input": "", "output": "Of course.  So same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "Tuesday at 4 pm.  I'll be there.  Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia.  Please take care."}, {"instruction": "I will.  And I think I will stay with Rene for the next week or so.  You understand.", "input": "", "output": "I do.  I will reach you there, if necessary."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor. How are you today?", "input": "", "output": "Hello Sylvia. I'm fine. How are you? You're looking well. Have\nyou begun to feel the effects of the medication I prescribed?"}, {"instruction": "Yes Doctor, stop worrying. I'm feeling much better. The horrible\nfeelings of anxiety and listlessness are going away. And I have begun to\nsleep at night again. Over all I'm feeling fine physically.", "input": "", "output": "Good. And emotionally?"}, {"instruction": "Well, as you can imagine there has been a lot of changes in my\nlife since the stick turned blue. First of all, please understand that I'm\nextremely happy. I got more than I ever hoped for. And I'll do everything\nand anything to keep my babies happy, healthy, and to term. At least as\nmuch as is possible in this situation. The question of the day is how to\nbreak the news to my parents and Tom. I think I need to deal with Tom first.\nI think my mother will ultimately be happy for me even though she'll be\ntotally freaked in the meantime. Maybe I should recommend you to her. What\ndo you think?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that would be proper."}, {"instruction": "I guess not.", "input": "", "output": "So you want to wait on telling your parents? And what's your\nplan with Tom?"}, {"instruction": "That is what I want to talk to you about. Last weekend I moved\nback home. I was feeling stronger emotionally and thought that I could deal\nwith him. And normally I think I could have. But Tom is really edgy. He\nlooks like he lost a lot of weight. He is not speaking but barking out monosyllabically.\nHe looks and acts like a caged animal.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Tom's life hasn't been exactly uneventful or stressless.\nAre you surprised at his reaction?"}, {"instruction": "I shouldn't be, but I was.", "input": "", "output": "It seems like you're holding all the cards right now. If Tom\nis that controlling..."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know.", "input": "", "output": "Has he done something particularly that upset you?"}, {"instruction": "I wasn't feeling well Sunday. I got a terrible case of morning\nsickness, which lasted all day. I even threw up a couple of times. Tom noticed\nand he just exploded at me. He told me that if I'm there just to give him\nmy stomach virus he's going to throw me out of his house. That I only come\nhome when I'm not feeling well and that I should have stayed with Rene and\ngot her sick instead. He told me that I look awful. That I got fat and swollen.\nThat the life of a prostitute is beginning to take hold of my appearance\nas well as my intellect. He said that he is ashamed of me. That he kept\nhoping that this will pass and that it's all just a drug induced nightmare.\nHe said that he should have sued you a long time ago. Well, he just lost\nit. And I was feeling way too sick to cope with it. I started crying. I\nhaven't done that in such a long time. I'm not even sure Tom has ever seen\nme cry. He was shocked. He got really quiet and then walked away. He didn't\ncome home until Monday night.", "input": "", "output": "Were you worried about him?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure. It's the way he looked at me just before he left.\nIt made me tremble.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure it's a good idea for you to still share a household?"}, {"instruction": "I'm pretty sure that it's a bad idea. I went to my lawyer again.\nI didn't want to start anything until much later. Second trimester maybe.\nBut with twins it will be too difficult to hide the fact of pregnancy for\nthat long.", "input": "", "output": "What are you planning to do?"}, {"instruction": "I want to start the divorce machinery as soon as possible and\nI want Tom out of my house right away.", "input": "", "output": "What was your lawyer's advice?"}, {"instruction": "She suggested something that I just don't feel comfortable doing.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "She asked if I would be willing to get a restraining order for\nTom.", "input": "", "output": "He hasn't threatened you has he?"}, {"instruction": "No. I don't think that Tom would ever resort to violence.", "input": "", "output": "So why the restraining order?"}, {"instruction": "Kelly's argument was that he has resorted to extreme measures\nto avoid having children. He has been actively hostile and extraordinary\ndeceitful. Kelly said that she could make an argument that he might turn\nviolent if confronted with what I have done. She said that my condition\nis delicate and that I should consider what would be best for me and my\nchildren.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think that would be?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I know that it wouldn't be having Tom live under the same\nroof with me. But I don't think I can do the restraining order. I just don't\nthink that physical violence is Tom's style. Oh, he would hurt me but it\nwould all be mental anguish.", "input": "", "output": "So what do you want to do?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure yet. I guess I have several options. One is tell\nhim right away and hope that he'll just move out. But I don't think he'll\ndo that. Another option would be to serve him with divorce papers as a surprise.\nThe problem is that he might demand to keep the house until the divorce\nis final. And since I moved out and rented another place with Rene already,\nI don't want to chance it.", "input": "", "output": "Is there another option?"}, {"instruction": "I can have all the legal papers ready and ask Tom to come with\nme to one of our sessions and then you could explain the situation to him.\nI'd give him the divorce papers at the end of our meeting.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think so."}, {"instruction": "But I'm sure you could keep Tom rational and make him understand\nthat all of this is just a logical result of his actions. He was the one\nto have a vasectomy. I would have been perfectly happy to have his children.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, I'll do all that I can to help you through this ordeal.\nBut I'm not a divorce mediator or a lawyer. And I don't think it would be\nthereupeutic for you to hide behind me instead of directly facing Tom. You\nreally have to confront him yourself."}, {"instruction": "But I don't know if I can. I'm very tired and I don't want to\nfight him.", "input": "", "output": "But you want to keep the house and get alimony and child support.\nThe phrase you used, I believe, is \"I will bleed him dry.\""}, {"instruction": "You have a good memory Doctor. Yes, I do want all of those things.\nI think I deserve it after what he put through. It wasn't my intention to\nhave to sleep with every man in sight to get pregnant. He made me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure it wasn't his intention either."}, {"instruction": "Okay, he drove me to it.", "input": "", "output": "It was also my impression that you enjoyed it."}, {"instruction": "Well, just a little.", "input": "", "output": "By the way what are your plans regarding the possible father\nof your twins? And have you thought that it might be more then one?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "It seems entirely possible that your twins might have two different\nfathers. After all, they were conceived about two weeks apart and you did\nhave multiple partners during this period."}, {"instruction": "I've been too busy to think of it that way. I've just been concentrating\non keeping the father's identity questionable. I don't want there to be\nany paternity issues. These children are mine exclusively. But having two\ndifferent fathers...I guess it's possible. Even likely given my schedule.\nWell, it doesn't matter to me. I'm happy with the genetics of all of the\ncandidates.", "input": "", "output": "That's good. But what about all of your men? Do you think they\nmight be interested in who the father was?"}, {"instruction": "It's none of their business. I'm married and by law these children\nare Tom's.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Plus there is no way to tell, right?", "input": "", "output": "What about DNA testing?"}, {"instruction": "I have to agree to that and I won't. Doctor, most of the men I\nslept with were one night stands. They didn't count on me wanting to get\npregnant and probably would rather I didn't raise the issue.", "input": "", "output": "Is that true for Richard for example? He was more regular than\nthat."}, {"instruction": "Yes. Richard might be a problem.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever have that talk with him?"}, {"instruction": "About multiple partners?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. And your relationship with him."}, {"instruction": "I thought it would be best to wait until I'd seen my obstetrician.\nAnd then it was just too crazy to have to deal with that.", "input": "", "output": "I think you should talk to him. Tell him everything. As unpleasant\nas it might be right now, it might be worse later."}, {"instruction": "You're right, of course. But it's just too much right now. I want\nto deal with Tom first. Then my family. And after I know that my pregnancy\nis okay, after the twelve weeks are up, I'll deal with the rest.", "input": "", "output": "That seems reasonable. Do you think\nyou can hide the fact that you are pregnant at work?"}, {"instruction": "I can try. Cassie, my secretary, knows apparently. She left me\na message. But I talked to her and explained that I don't want anyone to\nknow just yet. She seemed very understanding about keeping my secret. And\nas for people noticing, the winter is coming up and I can start wearing\nbulky clothing and sweaters. I think I can get away with it for a while.\nIt's more difficult with Tom. He already noticed a little. It won't be too\nlong before he puts two and two together. I really need to start dealing\nright away.", "input": "", "output": "If you are afraid to confront him alone, why don't you ask Rene\nto be with you when you talk to him?"}, {"instruction": "I might do that, although Rene is a very emotional and volatile\nperson. She might not be the best choice for an arbitrator.", "input": "", "output": "Are you looking for an arbitrator or for partner/protector?"}, {"instruction": "I guess the later. But it'll be quite a scene. Are you sure you're\nnot willing to participate Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I'm very sure."}, {"instruction": "Oh well, I had to try.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure you'll get what you want Sylvia.

How are you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm 10 weeks today.", "input": "", "output": "Congratulations!  But what do you mean?  How are you counting?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I count by the older one.  I can't go 42 weeks, or something, so the younger one is going to be premature no matter what I do.  So the older one is 10 weeks today.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I feel big and tired.  I don't think I can get away with hiding the pregnancy for as long as I thought.", "input": "", "output": "I agree.  You are definitely showing."}, {"instruction": "I think Tom knows.", "input": "", "output": "Why?  Has he said something?"}, {"instruction": "No.  But I'm pretty sure he knows.

He is going to do something that I will regret.", "input": "", "output": "Has Tom actually done or said anything to make you feel this way?"}, {"instruction": "No, no, Doctor.  It's nothing that obvious.  But he made breakfast the other morning and then offered it to me when I came into the kitchen.  I turned him down of course, but he did try to be nice to me.  And he keeps looking at me.  I feel like he is examining me--scrutinizing every part of my body.  I feel naked when he does that.  Like he could see through my clothes.  See directly into my uterus.  I know, now I definitely sound paranoid.  But I can't help it.  I feel my flesh starting to crawl and my hair standing on ends when he looks at me.  I can't wait until he's gone.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been talking some more to your lawyer?"}, {"instruction": "Kelly said that she has everything ready and I just have to say go.", "input": "", "output": "So what's keeping you?"}, {"instruction": "I feel that I have to tell Tom about the twins before I serve him the divorce papers.  I know it'll be ugly.  Especially now that I think he knows already that I'm pregnant.  I'm so sick lately that I feel all my energy draining out.  To confront Tom when I'm weak I think would be a mistake.  So I'm waiting.  Although as time goes on I realize that I should just do it.", "input": "", "output": "The morning sickness is usually gone by twelve weeks or so, right?"}, {"instruction": "Not necessarily.  Sometimes these symptoms last all the way up to five months of pregnancy.  And I hate calling it morning sickness.

I'll take him out for dinner sometime this week and tell him then.", "input": "", "output": "Why dinner?"}, {"instruction": "I just want to get him in a public place.

I'm admitting that I'm a coward but I'm also a woman in a delicate condition and I'm trying to treat myself nicely.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Maybe I can ask Rene to stay in a getaway car just outside the restaurant.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I'm just kidding Doctor.  I'm very nervous about talking to Tom and I'm making light of it.  When it really comes down to it, Tom really can't do much at this point.  The most important thing is that I'm going to be a mother.  I won the war.  The rest are just residual battles.", "input": "", "output": "Battles that you are planning on winning."}, {"instruction": "That would be nice.  Although being pregnant is definitely a handicap.  I had no idea that it would be like this.", "input": "", "output": "How is it?"}, {"instruction": "There is just a slew of problems.  Some are even comical.  I'll get up in the night because I have to go pee and then I realize that I'm very nauseous.  So I put crackers next to my bed.  I was told that eating saltine crackers reduces nausea.  Well, while I'm not sure of the medicinal properties of crackers, I'm positive that they're not the right food to eat in bed.  Between going to the bathroom, eating the crackers, and shaking the sheets, I get no sleep.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds rough."}, {"instruction": "And I'm acquiring the most outrageous eating habits.  I seem never to feel hungry.  But every couple of hours I feel like I'm going to die if I don't get food.  And when I feel that way, I have to have food now.  And I mean immediately.  I had to run out of a meeting last Friday to grab a candy bar and a coke.  Luckily, as a computer company, we're well supplied with these necessities of life.  I do have some crackers at my desk too, but sometimes a cracker just won't do.  I'm beginning to feel like I should buy Hershey's stock.", "input": "", "output": "Cravings for sugar are fairly common during pregnancy."}, {"instruction": "I can testify to that.

I find it exasperating.", "input": "", "output": "Doesn't sound like you're enjoying being pregnant."}, {"instruction": "I don't know who ever came up with this idea.

Our ancestors were prayed upon by numerous predators.  A pregnant female seems particularly vulnerable to an attack.  She's getting bigger.  Her center of balance shifts and she gets clumsier in her movements--bumping into things so to speak.  She will have problems running and climbing, making escape from her predators dubious.  She feels a constant urge to urinate and throw up--clearly an inferior design in the life and death struggles of the wild.  And from what I hear, delivery doesn't sound like it enhances survival.  At least now there are drugs and going off to the bushes seems to be optional.  But survival of the fittest...?", "input": "", "output": "I see you've thought a lot about it."}, {"instruction": "Just a bit.  I was talking to Rene about it.  She seems to have forgotten all the horrors of her pregnancy.  She said that there must be a built-in mechanism for automatically erasing all the unpleasant memories of child bearing and birth, because women tend to have more than one baby and, most importantly, want to have a second baby after going through the experience of having the first.

Can you feel them yet?"}, {"instruction": "No not yet.  I know that they are moving around a lot now.  But what they are kicking is mostly water.

I don't see much sense in doing this test.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not an expert, Sylvia.  But it seems to me that it would be wise to follow the advise of your obstetrician.

I read that a lot of women surrender themselves to their doctors.  They seem to be unwilling to make any decisions or take any responsibility for their own care.  That's strange to me.

Just showed up in the middle of the morning, unannounced, expecting me to drop everything and talk to him.  I explained to him that I was rather busy and, if he was interested in talking to me, we could try to set a date convenient for both of us.  He got angry, told me that I looked horrible, said something about Tom, and stormed out of the office.  It's just like Jeorge to cause a scene.  He does everything on a grand scale and is full of theatrics--a frustrated actor at heart.

I'm doing everything I can to improve my chances.  When I was at the hospital, they put a stitch in my cervix.  This is to provide extra support to the growing uterus which my body can't do on it's own.  I'm also cutting down on my working hours.  I ordered a new chair for my office that will allow me to shift the weight away from my dysfunctional cervix.  I will no longer take business trips or go to any meeting outside of SII's headquarters.  I've stopped exercising including walking for any distance further than my parking place.  And I stay off my feet as much as I can.  I'll probably end up on bed rest for the last few months.  I hope you won't mind turning our sessions into telephone conversations.

How remarkable!", "input": "", "output": "Sarcasm aside Sylvia, Jeorge described Tom's perspective.  He said that Tom is genuinely in love with you and always was.  Jeorge told me that Tom was very concerned about you.  That he was worried about your physical and mental health after the surgery.

As a journalist I know that better than most.  But after I found out about what Tom did to me, I sat down and tried hard to write his story from a neutral perspective.  But there's just no justification.  None.  What that miserable son of a bitch did was so horrible...he made a carefully considered conscious decision to unilaterally take away any chance I had at being happy.  I shudder to think what would have happened if I didn't find out in time.", "input": "", "output": "You're talking about understanding Tom's actions from a neutral perspective.  Don't you think that you'd be the last person to be able to do that?  As a journalist you understand how biases and prejudices creep into a story.

The genetic material would have been yours but you would have avoided the risk of miscarriage."}, {"instruction": "I thought a lot about it.  I also did a lot of research.  It's my impression that the surrogate business is still in its infancy, so to speak.  There are too many cases of surrogate mothers trying to keep the kids even if biologically the child isn't theirs.  In the United States, the courts seem to favor the rights of the surrogate mother.  And frankly, when I put myself in a surrogate's position, I don't see how I could give up the child either.  We're the products of a long evolutionary process whose main purpose is reproduction.  Our whole biology, down to the molecular level, is geared toward finding the right mate and conceiving and raising our own replacements.  When a body is carrying a child, the hormones and instincts don't know on whose chromosomes this baby is built.  The body does everything it can to give life to the child.  And it makes no difference who the father or the biological mother is.  It's all the same.  The body just takes over.  I don't know if it's right to ask anyone to give up the child that they brought into this world.  I don't think I could do it.", "input": "", "output": "I understand that most times it's not an issue.  Surrogate mothers are trained and experienced and understand what they are doing.

And then there is that other time when your child is not given to you and there is nothing you can do about it.  You can never see your child grow up.  You never have an opportunity...there'll be this person out there.  This person might look like your mother or father, they might walk just like your grandfather did, they might sneeze a dozen times in a row just like your aunt does.  There's this person who is a part of you and who you'll never know.  And then every time you see a child about the right age, you'll look and wonder.   I couldn't bear it.", "input": "", "output": "So you felt that having a child yourself was the only option?"}, {"instruction": "I don't see any other way.  And as I said, I think the benefits outweigh the risks.", "input": "", "output": "Tom clearly didn't think so."}, {"instruction": "No Tom didn't.", "input": "", "output": "Jeorge mentioned that Tom was always actively against the idea of having children and never pretended to go along with your attempts at getting pregnant.  That is not exactly how you presented the situation to me."}, {"instruction": "What, are you going to turn on me too?  You're my therapist.  You are supposed to be on my side.  Do I have to battle you and my parents and Jeorge and Tom all by myself?  I can you know.  I can take you all on!", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, you know this isn't about taking sides.  My job is not about being your advocate.  My job is to help you understand yourself better.

I know.  I implied that we were both trying to get pregnant, when really only I was.

Withdrawal?"}, {"instruction": "Tom was big on withdrawal.

Goodbye Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "How is the new medication?"}, {"instruction": "I guess it's okay.  Doctor, I'm feeling like events and circumstances are just taking hold of my life and I'm losing all control.", "input": "", "output": "You're talking about Friday?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.

Did you think you could go through your pregnancy keeping it a secret?"}, {"instruction": "No of course not.  But I find myself so unprepared.  I was trying to get pregnant for so long that I just expected it would take a long time even with men who aren't shooting blanks.  Did you ever see the documentary \"The Miracle of Life?\"", "input": "", "output": "Yes, actually I have."}, {"instruction": "Remember all the events and conditions that had to be just right in order for conception to occur?", "input": "", "output": "I remember being surprised that the chances were so low."}, {"instruction": "That's right.  Most sperm are duds and never even go past the cervix.  The rest face a hostile environment all the way to the end, the female body regarding them as unwelcomed intruders.  Even the ones that make it as far the fallopian tubes face these great \"Lady and the Tiger\" dilemma--two tubes, one of which has an egg and the other nothing.  And out of billions of sperm only one makes it.  But all of this is futile if the timing is not just right.

Tom shocked me.  I was completely helpless.  You've got to understand that I'm dressed in this little blue paper gown that's open everywhere and otherwise I'm naked.  I'm lying on my back with my feet up in the air in these stirrups.  The Doctor is sitting on his little stool checking my cervix and in walks Tom.  The Doctor actually motioned him to come on in.  It's like he had a right to be there.  And Tom acts as if he's known all along.  After I freaked out, Dr. Malleson took him into his office and filled him in on all the details.  I felt like such an ass.  I couldn't do anything.  Everyone just assumed they were his children and treated him as an expectant father.  Dr. Malleson thinks that I'm having a nervous breakdown.  I can just imagine the conversation he had with you.", "input": "", "output": "Dr. Malleson was very concerned about you."}, {"instruction": "I really lost it in his office.

But he kept on pressing the sanctity of the marriage and so on.  If he really felt that way why did he go with me?  I don't want to feel bad for his indiscretions.  His marriage is his problem and if he really loved his wife he wouldn't have done what he did.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But the last week or so he's been simply impossible.

My dad told me that ever since my fight with Tom...they are calling it a fight...my mother's been feeling worse.  They had to take her to the hospital a couple of times with chest pains.  The doctor told them that she needs to cut down on excitement and worry in her life.  He suggested that they sell the restaurant because running it might be too much for my mother.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't know any of this?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I wasn't speaking to my parents.  The last conversation we had was so explosive--them trying to convince me that Tom was only doing what's best for me--that I just stopped communicating with them.  I felt that I needed all the strength I could muster to carry out my plan.  I thought that once they saw me pregnant it would all be okay somehow.  Anyhow, my dad and I walked over to the car.  She looked so frail different than I've ever seen her before.  She was always the strong one, bending everyone to her will.  It was frightening to see her like that.  I don't think I ever saw her cry.  I felt like a little girl who did something horribly wrong and is now about to hear what her punishment is going to be.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk to your mother?"}, {"instruction": "I told her that I have a present for her but it will take another five months before I can give it to her.  She started to get out of the car.  My dad went to help her.  She looked like she lost a lot of weight.  Her hands were shaking.  She was looking up at me, her face wet and her eyes full of tears.  I felt so horrible.  I hadn't realized just how much I would miss her if something happened to her.  I felt a deep void in my stomach and my knees felt week.  She came over to me, with my dad helping her, and she hugged me.  She didn't say anything.  She just kept holding on to me.  I was going to tell her that everything was going to be all right but somehow I just couldn't master the words.  And dad was looking at me with such accusation in his eyes: \"Look.  Look what you did to her.  It's all your fault.\"", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I started to cry too.  She looked up at me and started to comfort me just as if I was a child.  She was telling me it was going to be all right.  She was being strong for me.  She kept telling me that she will make everything better, that she would take care of it.  I kept crying in her arms and telling her I was sorry.  Finally dad said that we'd better get inside.", "input": "", "output": "Did you go up to Rene's apartment?"}, {"instruction": "No they didn't want to.  I went home with them in the car.  I kept having this feeling of being a little girl.  And them being the parents again.  Not like they are now.  As adults we all seem to lose the sense of protection, love, and a feeling that our parents are all powerful beings.  But being with them that night, it was like dropping back into childhood.  It was like being five again.  Except that there was an underlying feeling of dread everytime I looked at my mom.  It was as if I needed to recapture that feeling of being young quick before something happened to her.  Like there's not enough time.", "input": "", "output": "You think that your mom's health problem is that serious?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't inquire further about your mom's medical condition?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't appropriate then.  I couldn't break the illusion of that night.

At some point I even thought that if all this was a dream I wouldn't be all that surprised.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk to your parents later on in the week?"}, {"instruction": "Later in the week Tom happened.  So no.  I just didn't have a chance.  You know I didn't even tell them that I have twins?  Somehow it just never came up again.  They think I'm having a boy and that's it.", "input": "", "output": "Are you going to tell them?"}, {"instruction": "Actually I don't know.  I'm worried that if I tell them about the twins, it would kill my mother.  She is already freaked out.  I think she looks at me and sees a dead grandchild and a life of insanity for me.  I don't think she could handle the weight of knowing that I'm carrying two.  She knows that the risks are high enough with one.", "input": "", "output": "On the other hand, if she finds out about the twins in some other way..."}, {"instruction": "I thought about that, Doctor.  I'll have a miscarriage or go into early labor--the two are sometimes synonymous--and she'll learn that she might lose two grandchildren at once.", "input": "", "output": "That's not exactly what I had in mind.

He won't say anything to hurt my mother.", "input": "", "output": "So how did that conversation go?"}, {"instruction": "As I said life is full of surprises.  I had a plan.  I was going to sit him down and tell him in the morning over coffee.  Very civilized discussion.

But it would have been nice.", "input": "", "output": "So what did happen?"}, {"instruction": "I got to my house on Wednesday night.  When I walked in, I thought that there was no one home.  All the lights were off.  There were no sounds.  I was so relieved.  I planned on going straight into my bedroom and shutting the door.  I was going to get my self psyched for the morning confrontation.  I was also going to get some rest.  I'm a lot more tired now and I get very irritable and stupid when I'm tired.  I get too tired to think.", "input": "", "output": "Uh oh."}, {"instruction": "Well when I got home and there was nobody there, I just let go.  It was as if I had been holding my breath all day and now it was safe to breathe again.  I turned on some lights, got into my pajamas, and decided to make myself a snack before going to bed.  I'm eating for three these days.  The day before with my parents was so hard.  I really needed the time to regroup and pull myself together again for the conversation with Tom.", "input": "", "output": "Tom was home?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, Tom was home.  He was watching me go through my routine for getting ready for bed.  When I finally made it to the kitchen and turned on the lights, he was waiting for me, sitting at the breakfast table.  He must have been there for hours waiting in the dark for me.  He asked me if I am ready to talk.  I felt sick and my heart was beating so hard that I could feel it in my fingertips.  I was not ready.  I realized that I wasn't even ready for the planned conversation the following morning.  I haven't said a word and he has won already.", "input": "", "output": "There is not winning or losing.  You are not playing a game, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "No I'm not.

I was going to give him the papers and yet he was the one in control.", "input": "", "output": "Did you give him the divorce papers?"}, {"instruction": "He sat there looking at me, not saying another word, just waiting for me to make a move.  It was as if he was a snake charming me into immobility before he would strike.  I thought time stopped.  The watch on the wall was ticking so slowly.  Finally I told him that I needed something to drink.  He got up, helped me to a chair, and poured me a glass of milk.  He waited for me to finish it and asked his question again.  I had to talk right then on his terms.  It just wasn't the way I planned it at all.  I finally decided to just give him the envelope and wait to see what he was going to do.", "input": "", "output": "How did he take it?"}, {"instruction": "He said that I must have carried it with me for awhile.  The envelope was becoming a bit ragged around the edges from being in my briefcase for so long.  He said it very casually like he was expecting it.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like he was expecting it."}, {"instruction": "I did give him a number of hints.", "input": "", "output": "Yes you did."}, {"instruction": "He looked over the papers and asked me if I was expecting for him to agree to all that.  I said that I hoped he would.  Then he looked up at me and stared into my eyes.  I felt like a deer in a truck's headlight.  I couldn't move or look away.  Then he suddenly got up and walked away.  When I got control over my legs and body again I went up to my bedroom and shut the door.  In the morning, when I got up and went downstairs, Tom was gone and so were the papers.", "input": "", "output": "That was Thursday morning.  Did you speak with Tom after that?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't see him Thursday night.  I'm not sure he ever came home.  Friday I packed my bags and took them with me to work.  Rene, Robert, and I spent the long weekend together up in Sonoma.  Robert had Monday off from school for Columbus Day.  I wanted to do something nice for him.  It's been very hard on him adjusting to a new school and new friends.", "input": "", "output": "That was nice of you.  Have you been home since you came back?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I'll go home tomorrow night.  Last week was pretty hard on me.  I decided to take a break from my immediate family.", "input": "", "output": "The sooner you deal and face your obligations the easier your life is going to be."}, {"instruction": "I know.  I need to have everything settled before I go on bed rest.", "input": "", "output": "When are you planning on starting?"}, {"instruction": "Dr. Malleson thinks that I might have to start on restricted activity in the next couple of weeks and go on full bed rest some time after that depending on how my cervix is holding up.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to move our sessions to a telephone format?"}, {"instruction": "Not yet Doctor.  I would like to continue coming to your office for as long as possible.  I find being here clears my thoughts.  I get a better perspective on my life from this chair than from any other location.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad our sessions are working for you.  I also like being in the same room with you when we talk.  Should we schedule our next session?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  This same time next week would be fine.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  I'll see you then.  That's October 22nd at 4 pm.  Please take of yourself.  And try calling your mom.  I think it would be good for both of you."}, {"instruction": "I'll see.  I'll see you next week and thank you Doctor.  You are always good for me.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  I'll let you decide.", "input": "", "output": "That's not a good start.  What happened?"}, {"instruction": "The most inconceivable thing in the world.", "input": "", "output": "I need a better hint than that Sylvia.  You have one of the most improbable stories so far--I think it would be hard to surprise me."}, {"instruction": "I wish I could joke with you but...", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry Sylvia.  I didn't mean to make light of your situation.  Something bad happened?  Are the babies all right?"}, {"instruction": "The babies are fine.  I even think that I'm beginning to feel them move and kick around in there.", "input": "", "output": "You are at fourteen weeks now?  It's very possible that you might actually be feeling some movement.  Especially with twins.  Soon you'll think that you have a couple of kick-boxers in there."}, {"instruction": "I can't wait.", "input": "", "output": "No, no Sylvia.  That's the good part."}, {"instruction": "Maybe they are just training how to escape their father.", "input": "", "output": "What?  You found out who the father is?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I know who the father isn't.  Although that's not stopping him.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia you are talking in riddles today.  What happened?  Did Tom do something?"}, {"instruction": "You can say that.", "input": "", "output": "What did he do?"}, {"instruction": "He was like a shadow all last week.  I knew he was in the house.  I could feel him.  But I never saw him.  Finally on Saturday, I was going to confront him about it.  I gave him the papers, so to speak, and I want him out.", "input": "", "output": "Well you never actually expected for him to go quietly, did you?"}, {"instruction": "I was hoping he was going to be a gentleman about it.", "input": "", "output": "Really Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "I was hoping.  So on Saturday, I get up really early and I waited for him in his room--he was still taking a shower so I just came in.  When he got out and saw me, for a moment dozens of expressions and thoughts moved quickly across his face and then it turned back to stone.  He looked at me and then proceeded to go about his business as if I wasn't there.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He dried himself off and threw the towel on the bathroom floor.  It was a long time since I'd seen him nude.  It looked like he lost some weight.  Actually he looked really good.  As I was sitting in the chair, he proceeded to make the bed and pick out the clothes he was going to wear.  He didn't even look at me after that first initial glance.  I knew he cared and I knew that I surprised him.  But he was all control.  Finally I asked if we could talk.  He turned to me--he was still completely naked--and asked if there was time for him to get dressed or if I preferred him as he was?  I told him that I could wait and quickly left the room.", "input": "", "output": "So that bothers you?"}, {"instruction": "It wasn't that he was naked in front of me.  That was my fault.  What got me really uncomfortable is how he made me feel.  If he caught me naked by surprise I don't think I would have maintained my cool the way he did.", "input": "", "output": "If I remember correctly, that's just what you did.  You told me about putting on a show for Tom.  Letting him watch you take a shower and get dressed and purposely trying to arouse him."}, {"instruction": "That was different.", "input": "", "output": "It seems the difference is who was putting on a show for whom, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "It was more about control.  I was going to confront him.  I came in to his room.  He was surprised and naked.  And he was in control.  So completely in control.", "input": "", "output": "You were in control when you were putting on a show for him."}, {"instruction": "Not in this way.", "input": "", "output": "What is the difference?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think my motivations were as evil as his.", "input": "", "output": "Evil?"}, {"instruction": "I was just trying to make him want me.", "input": "", "output": "You were flouting the fact that he couldn't have you."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I was just trying to get back at him.", "input": "", "output": "You don't think that that is what he was trying to do?"}, {"instruction": "No.  It was more than that.", "input": "", "output": "Did you have your conversation with Tom?"}, {"instruction": "Not on Saturday.", "input": "", "output": "Tom did go back and find you after he dressed?"}, {"instruction": "I got scared and left.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia!"}, {"instruction": "I couldn't.  I could feel that something horrible was about to happen.  I started to get a panicky feeling as I was waiting for him in the kitchen.  The next thing I knew I was in car driving across the Golden Gate Bridge.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I kept driving north for a while.  I felt that I needed to get away as far as I could.  I finally ended up somewhere near Fort Bragg and stayed in a little hotel there.", "input": "", "output": "You are developing a pattern of running away in the face of confrontation.  This is not the first time you chose escape rather than facing the reality of a situation."}, {"instruction": "I noticed that too.  I think pregnancy is making me a lot more cautious.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps."}, {"instruction": "It's really not my style to run.", "input": "", "output": "So when did you have your conversation with Tom?"}, {"instruction": "I was trying to leave the house for work on Monday morning.  Tom caught me just as I was leaving.  He asked how was my weekend.  I told him that it was fine and that I was sorry about missing him Saturday.  He replied that it was no problem and it allowed him to get a few things settled anyway.  As he was saying that I begun to feel the floor giving away from under my feet.  I knew it was going to be bad.  He asked if I could come into the office with him for just a minute.  I felt like a cow being taken to a slaughterhouse.", "input": "", "output": "What did Tom have in mind for you?"}, {"instruction": "Custody papers.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "That was my reaction as well.  Tom wants custody of the twins.", "input": "", "output": "But they are not his."}, {"instruction": "Well legally they are.", "input": "", "output": "But genetically they are not."}, {"instruction": "He doesn't care about that.  He said that as long as the kids were conceived during the marriage, he is their father.  And he wants full custody.  He said that he has consulted a lawyer and, given my irresponsibility toward the well-being of these children, he is petitioning for full custody.", "input": "", "output": "Can he do that?  And what irresponsibility?"}, {"instruction": "He mentioned the unknown biological father as one of the factors.  There was a statement about my medical condition and the possibility of endangering the twins.  Everything sort of turned gray after some point.  I remember Tom giving me a glass of water and I was sitting behind the desk trying to read the papers.  Finally Tom suggested that I should go and consult my attorney and then he left.", "input": "", "output": "Did you speak with your attorney?"}, {"instruction": "She was shocked that Tom would do that.  She took all the papers and said that she'd get back to me soon.  I haven't told anyone about this yet.  I don't even feel like it is really real.  Why would Tom want them.  They are mine not his.  He has nothing to do with them.", "input": "", "output": "You were going to use the fact that they were conceived during the marriage to get Tom to pay child support and..."}, {"instruction": "Sure.  I was trying to get back to him for what he'd done to me.  But what does he want?  I know he doesn't really want the kids.  He never wanted to have children.  So this is just some sort of a game.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think Tom is trying to gain by this?"}, {"instruction": "The only thing I could think of is that he is trying to use the children as a bargaining chip--for me to give up all my claims against him and, in return, he will let me have my children.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's a really low blow even for Tom.  I know you like him Doctor, but don't you think it is?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know Sylvia.  I would be interested in getting more details about his position, claim, and motivation."}, {"instruction": "I can't really tell you more than I already did.  After Tom left I was just too...everything gets me so tired lately.  I just had no energy to deal.  I gave the papers to Kelly and basically just left them for her to deal with.  I suppose that she will get back to me.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  You don't seem too upset about all this."}, {"instruction": "I just don't think Tom can really get away with this, although it is very creative, I have to give him that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  You know our time is up?"}, {"instruction": "Time has a tendency to fly when we are talking about Tom.  Should we schedule for next week?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  Next Tuesday at 4 pm.  That's October 29th."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  I let you know how this all plays out.  I assume it will be all over in the next couple of days.  I wonder what he will do next.", "input": "", "output": "It doesn't sound to me like this problem will go away so soon.  Please call me if you need to talk."}, {"instruction": "I will Doctor.  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Oh and how is your mother?"}, {"instruction": "We spoke on the phone a couple of times last week.  No real content but I think it made her feel better.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  I'm glad she's feeling better."}, {"instruction": "Me too.  Thank you for asking Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  We're doing fine.  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Good, good.  How is the paternity suit?"}, {"instruction": "Now that's the real question.", "input": "", "output": "Well?"}, {"instruction": "It looks like it's going to take longer than I thought.  I spoke with Kelly and she started to cite all kinds of problems and complications.  The up-shot is that I have to live with Tom until all this gets sorted out.", "input": "", "output": "Why?  What's the problem?"}, {"instruction": "He is pursuing the notion that I'm not responsible enough to deal with this pregnancy on my own and that I need guardianship.  His argument is that since the children are legally his and that he is fighting for full custody, until all this gets settled he wants to be in a position to \"protect\" them.", "input": "", "output": "Protect them from what?"}, {"instruction": "That's what I said.  It's clear to everyone that I went to extreme measures to get these children.  So why on Earth would I do something to jeopardize my chances of becoming a mother now?  Not to mention that Tom went to extreme measures not to have children and he has plenty of motive to see that the twins are never born.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia are you saying that you believe that Tom is doing all this to harm the twins?  Do you think that he will hurt you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I'm not really saying that.  Kelly was saying most of this.  It's her argument.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't believe that Tom would do anything to harm you or the twins?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I don't know what his motivations are anymore.  But I know that he would never harm me physically.  Mentally and spiritually...well that's another matter.", "input": "", "output": "So in the meantime you have to live with Tom?"}, {"instruction": "It looks that way.  It won't be for long.  What judge in the world wouldn't take my side?  It's just that things always take longer than we expect.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about living with him?"}, {"instruction": "As long as he stays out of my hair it will be fine.  And when it gets to be too much, I'll stay with Rene for a couple of nights.", "input": "", "output": "How is Rene?"}, {"instruction": "She's been terrific.  I don't know what I would do without her.  She has been so supportive--taking me maternity shopping, talking to my mother, making me dinner, keeping me sane in general.", "input": "", "output": "Do your parents know about Tom's custody suit?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't tell them.  My mom is still feeling rather fragile and I don't want to add to her plate of worries.  Plus it's just a matter of time.  Tom doesn't have a chance and in a few weeks it will all be over.  Maybe I'll tell her then.", "input": "", "output": "So your mother is still feeling sick?"}, {"instruction": "Off and on.  You don't have to tell me that I'm the primary reason for her ailment.", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't planning on it Sylvia.  Your mom has heart problems, right?  You are not responsible for heart disease."}, {"instruction": "No, that's not what I meant.  I feel responsible for adding so much stress to her life.  She should be somewhere nice and warm with soothing music playing in the background.  Instead she has me and all my problems.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure she doesn't see it that way."}, {"instruction": "My father does.  But I guess it will all straighten out in about twenty weeks.", "input": "", "output": "Dr. Malleson thinks you will deliver at thirty five weeks?"}, {"instruction": "He didn't exactly say that.  But from what I read it seems to be the average length for twin pregnancies.  I obviously want to have them as late as possible, but I'm just being realistic.", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be in a very calm and resigned mood today."}, {"instruction": "Yes I know.  I've just decided to take things as them come.  I'm letting other people worry for a change while I stand back and just observe.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Did anything else happen last week?"}, {"instruction": "Why?  Am I making you nervous Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "No.  I just thought I'd ask.  How is work?"}, {"instruction": "Well everyone knows.  And I mean everyone.  I'm the current topic of conversations.  I think there might be bets going around the office on who the father is.", "input": "", "output": "So people in SII know that the twins are not Tom's?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently some people know.  I guess men are just not very good at keeping their mouths shut--but I learned that in high school.  I assume that one or more of my conquests talked.", "input": "", "output": "Seeing you so pregnant they just might be nervous.  You told me about David and a little about Hal.  You also mentioned that Richard's been acting a bit strange too.  Anyone else?"}, {"instruction": "Well let me fill you in on all the dirt.  I just assumed that you would be on top of it since everybody else seems to be.", "input": "", "output": "No.  I'm pretty isolated out here.  I only get to hear what you tell me."}, {"instruction": "Let me see.  I told you that Hal was acting like a lunatic.  In fact I suggested that he should come and talk to you.  But by the reaction I got from him when I said that my guess is that he didn't run to the nearest phone to call you.  He is such a strange man.", "input": "", "output": "You talked about firing him at one time.  Are you still considering it?"}, {"instruction": "The man is an idiot and a spineless creep.  But he has two children and a wife to support...he is also not a bad writer when he actually does it.  I don't know.  Maybe it will pass.  I gave him a big assignment and told him...no rather insisted that he should work at home more.  It's been better this way.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And what about Richard and the rest?"}, {"instruction": "Richard I just don't understand.  He is a very smart man.  I would love to be friends with him and share his company.  But he is just so over the top.", "input": "", "output": "In what way?"}, {"instruction": "I think that he honestly believes that there is some kind of conspiracy going on.  He follows me around trying to be as inconspicuous as possible.  But he has this bright red car.  I always know when he is behind me.", "input": "", "output": "Richard is following you in a car?"}, {"instruction": "Hard to believe isn't it?  About a week and a half ago he was staking out me out--he was parked a couple of driveways away from the front of my house.  He's done this a few times before.  So I went outside and walked to his car.  I was going to talk to him.  As I approached, he ducked and covered up.  I asked him what was he doing there.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he was just trying to make sure that I was all right.  When I asked him why wouldn't I be, he mentioned Tom.  I think he believes that Tom is trying to do something bad to me or something.  Not that he is wrong but--I told him that I can take care of myself and that, as touching as his attempts to protect me are, I want him to cut it out.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think Richard believes that Tom is out to get you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  Every one knows that I had affairs.  But I don't think anyone knows that Tom had a vasectomy.  I was always very careful to keep it a secret from everyone at SII.  I wanted all the prospective fathers to believe that my child could be Tom's.  This way I was hoping to avoid all the fuss.  Although it didn't seem to help.", "input": "", "output": "San Francisco is a small town.  Your friends knew about Tom.  It's not inconceivable that the news has spread."}, {"instruction": "Could be.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever sit down with Richard and have a conversation about what your plans for the future are?"}, {"instruction": "We spoke a little.  But I got an impression that Richard didn't believe me when I told him that the twins were not his.  More than that, he acted as if what I was saying had a double meaning, with the real message being that I simply couldn't talk to him about my pregnancy and my plans for the future before my divorce with Tom is final.  I tried to convince him otherwise but the more I talked the more conspiratorial he got.  I had to just let it go.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that Richard might be in love with you?"}, {"instruction": "I have no idea.  He certainly expresses it in a strange way.  No.  I really don't think so.", "input": "", "output": "So what about others?"}, {"instruction": "I got an e-mail message from Bruce.  He is in Italy and is having a great time.  Said that he missed me and wished I would join him.", "input": "", "output": "Bruce is the sculptor."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  He doesn't know about the pregnancy.  I saw Matthew the other day.  He congratulated me on being pregnant.  Asked how far along I was.  I told him that I was about halfway.  I saw him do the math in his head and then he was visibly relieved.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you lie to him?"}, {"instruction": "What difference does it really make whether I told him I was fifteen or twenty weeks pregnant?

You have a list too?"}, {"instruction": "Well it's not actually my list.  It's Rene's.  She said that her memory is just not good enough anymore to remember them all.  She even has all the dates.", "input": "", "output": "So Rene can potentially extrapolate who the father is?"}, {"instruction": "She would never do that.  She is interested in keeping that information a mystery as much as I am.

Are there more?"}, {"instruction": "You mean do I have more to tell about the men on the list?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "No.  I think I got you up to date more or less.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you.

Shall we make an appointment next week?", "input": "", "output": "Next Tuesday, November 5th at 4 pm?"}, {"instruction": "That's good.  I'll see you then Doctor.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sylvia.  Have a happy Halloween."}, {"instruction": "Oh, you too Doctor.  Enjoy the show.", "input": "", "output": "Are you dressing up on Halloween?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm thinking of Humpty Dumpty.  How about you Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I just thought I'd throw on a white lab coat and a stethescope."}, {"instruction": "Wow, that's very original.  I bet you've never worn that costume before.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah, every year."}, {"instruction": "Why don't you go as a caveman?  I think you'd make a good primitive.  Give you a chance to exercise your id.", "input": "", "output": "Gee thanks Sylvia.  See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  And yes I'm tired.  I'm also pissed, freaked, outraged, and I want to kill Tom.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  I seem to remember you in a similar state of mind during our first session."}, {"instruction": "Don't make light of my situation Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry Sylvia.  It wasn't my intention.  But what happened?  I saw you on Halloween and..."}, {"instruction": "Yes, yes.  I had a good time on Halloween too.  That's not my problem now.", "input": "", "output": "Take it easy Sylvia.  You're shaking and turning red.  That's not good for you or the twins."}, {"instruction": "You and everybody else in this world seem to know exactly what's good for me and my babies.  If you all just left me alone, I would probably have a perfectly normal pregnancy.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, I'm just inquiring about what happen.  Please sit down, you are making me very uncomfortable watching you pace around my office.  Didn't you say something about bed rest?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, you are not my obstetrician.  You job is to keep me sane and not to worry about the twins.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, please sit down, take a deep breath, and perhaps drink a glass of water or something.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "I'll sit down if that's what it takes to make you happy Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "That makes me happy.  Thank you Sylvia.  Now would you like a glass of water?"}, {"instruction": "Is that for me or for the twins?", "input": "", "output": "I was thinking it was for you.  But the twins could have some too, I suppose."}, {"instruction": "The twins are parasites--they have everything I have.", "input": "", "output": "Is the pregnancy getting you down?"}, {"instruction": "I love being pregnant!  You know that Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I was just asking."}, {"instruction": "Well stop asking ridiculous questions.", "input": "", "output": "I'll try.  Now why do you want to kill Tom?"}, {"instruction": "A much better question.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you.  I'm doing my best."}, {"instruction": "Tom pulled another stupid legal trick.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Would you like to tell me about it?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor stop talking like a therapist!  I want you to be sympathetic--like a friend.  I come to you for help.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia I'm very sympathetic and I would very much like to know what has happened to make you so unhappy."}, {"instruction": "Tom left a bunch of papers for me on Wednesday.  But with work and Halloween, well I just didn't get around to it.  On Friday I just gave the whole envelope to Kelly and left her to deal.  On Saturday I got my first message from Kelly.  She sounded very amused and said that she would like to talk to me right away.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Rene, Robert, and I were going to have dinner with my parents and I just didn't want to spoil the mood listening to some legal acrobatics.

Until she hears about this.", "input": "", "output": "So you called Kelly and?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't call Kelly.  When I got home on Saturday night, I had ten voice mail messages from her each increasingly more agitated.  Needless to say, after that the last thing I wanted to do was to call her.", "input": "", "output": "Of course."}, {"instruction": "Doctor you said yourself that I should keep my level of aggravation down to a necessary minimum.  I figured that whatever it was, it could keep until the business week starts on Monday.", "input": "", "output": "Did Kelly try to get in touch with you before then?"}, {"instruction": "I refused to answer the phone all day.", "input": "", "output": "Was Tom home?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  He answered all the calls and meticulously took down messages.  He gave me huge stack of them and mentioned that perhaps I should call Kelly back since she was so desperate to get in touch with me.  If I've only known what that bastard had planned for me!", "input": "", "output": "What was that?"}, {"instruction": "It was a little something that he and his lawyers thought up for me.  The envelope I gave to Kelly outlined their general plan.", "input": "", "output": "I guess it's safe to assume you disapprove of their plan?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes you are just too mild mannered Doctor.  I not only disapprove of their plans, I would like to rip...", "input": "", "output": "Keep your blood pressure down Sylvia.  What does Tom want you to do?"}, {"instruction": "Well let me see if I can remember it all.  It starts by advising me that I will be on bed rest as of November 15th of this year.", "input": "", "output": "Did Doctor Malleson prescribe bed rest for you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  This has nothing to do with Doctor Malleson.  They did mention another obstetrician that was advising them on my medical condition, but it was not Doctor Malleson.  In fact, it's someone whose name I've never even heard of--Doctor Brezdon--Doctor Frezdon--Doctor something \"don.\"", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I understand."}, {"instruction": "I'm sure I don't understand how they got the nerve to get some charlatan to look at my records behind my back and, what is really unbelievable, how he gets the right to tell me what to do!", "input": "", "output": "Calm down Sylvia.  What else does this document advise you to do?"}, {"instruction": "Well I can no longer leave my house without presenting Tom with a complete itinerary of all the locations I will be at during the day and a brief description of all physical actions I will be performing while there.", "input": "", "output": "What else?"}, {"instruction": "I have to present him with the list of all the drugs I'm currently taking, legal and illegal, for an evaluation by his obstetrician.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I have to create a diet plan for the entire pregnancy and have it approved as well.  Oh and if I deviate from the proposed menu for a particular day, I have to notify Tom or his obstetrician by what and how much.", "input": "", "output": "What else?"}, {"instruction": "I'm no longer allowed to drive a car.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "I was deemed to be excitable and too irresponsible to be trusted with the operation of heavy equipment.", "input": "", "output": "How did you get to work today?"}, {"instruction": "I drove.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  What else?"}, {"instruction": "Oh you'll love this.  I'm no longer allowed to have any sexual relations.  Can you believe this?

No orgasms.  I'm not allowed to have sex with men or women.  I'm not allowed to masturbate manually or with any other object or person.  And I'm not allowed to have an orgasm...to come...to reach climax.", "input": "", "output": "I got all that.  They are worried about your cervix?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think they had my cervix on their minds when they were preparing this document Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps not.  But I think the instructions in this document are designed to protect your cervix.  Sexual intercourse could lead to a thinning of the cervix and in your condition..."}, {"instruction": "I know what my condition is.", "input": "", "output": "Orgasms could also lead to cervical and uterine contractions."}, {"instruction": "I'm destined to explode from sexual tension.", "input": "", "output": "I know it sounds horrendous to you right now, but I think what Tom is trying to do is to prevent an onset of early labor.  In fact, Doctor Malleson might have given you these same instructions in the not so unforeseeable future."}, {"instruction": "Doctor I...", "input": "", "output": "As for the diet, bed rest, and all that other stuff..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, if Doctor Malleson talked to me and told me that it was time for me to be on bed rest, if he told me that I have to adhere to a particular diet, if he told me that I have to abstain from sex for the next six months, even if he told me that I have to avoid having orgasm, if Doctor Malleson told me all that I might...no I would listen to him.  But all this is in a legal document drafted with the sole purpose of driving me so insane that I would walk away from Tom leaving him with everything we both worked so hard for most of our lives.  This is not about me or my babies.  No Doctor, this is all about Tom.  I'm telling you that man is truly evil.", "input": "", "output": "So you believe that there is no chance that any of the instructions presented to you in that legal document were designed to protect the twins?"}, {"instruction": "Oh I believe that these documents were carefully drafted to make everyone think that that is what they are intended for.", "input": "", "output": "What is your lawyer's recommendation?"}, {"instruction": "Kelly advised me to make an appointment with Doctor Malleson.  She wants to be present during the examination.  She is also setting up his deposition.  She wants to record Doctor Malleson's official position on the condition of my cervix.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Can you think of any other divorce case which required an expert's testimony about the wife's cervical condition?", "input": "", "output": "No, I cannot say I have."}, {"instruction": "When I was talking with Rene, she couldn't decide whether she should laugh hysterically or be intensely outraged.", "input": "", "output": "I could see how this could be a dilemma for her."}, {"instruction": "I have to say that when I step aside and think as a reporter, I cannot help but think that all of this would make a terrific story for the National Inquirer.", "input": "", "output": "So when is your appointment with Doctor Malleson?"}, {"instruction": "Friday.  He was out of town and couldn't make it any sooner than that.", "input": "", "output": "Would you be required to stay at home and..."}, {"instruction": "No chance!  In fact I called Richard and asked him if I could stay with him for the next couple of nights.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Now Doctor, you told me that I should spend some quality time with him,  didn't you?", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you stay with Rene if you can't be at home?"}, {"instruction": "Why does Tom serve me with these papers?", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think..."}, {"instruction": "I think all the time Doctor.

I mean considering.", "input": "", "output": "Well you are almost halfway through."}, {"instruction": "With twins seventeen weeks is halfway through.", "input": "", "output": "So how are the boys?"}, {"instruction": "Very active, thank you.  They sleep when I'm awake and they party when I try to sleep.  But we try to get along and that's more than I can say for Tom and me.", "input": "", "output": "That was my next question.  Did you stay with Richard last week?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I spoke with Richard right after our last session and he was delighted that I wanted to spend some time with him.  I took a cab to work on Wednesday and we went to his apartment that night.", "input": "", "output": "How did Tom react to all this."}, {"instruction": "I think it would be accurate to say that he did not take it well.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Basically I left him a little note saying that I would be out for the next couple of nights and that the gardener is coming on Thursday morning and he needs to leave the gate open for him.", "input": "", "output": "So Tom wasn't pleased with that?"}, {"instruction": "I heard from Kelly Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm.  I guess Tom found the note earlier than I expected.  I assume that he called his lawyer and his lawyer got in touch with Kelly.", "input": "", "output": "I assume that Kelly wasn't pleased either."}, {"instruction": "No.  Her recommendation was for me to go home immediately and to stay there until this whole thing is settled.  I think she is worrying too much about this.  I don't think any judge in the world would take Tom's demands seriously.", "input": "", "output": "But don't you think that it would be better to play it safe?  Just in case?"}, {"instruction": "I feel that if I start giving in now it will never end.  I don't know what Tom's goals are but they clearly not in my best interests.  It makes more sense to me to counter his every move.  I think of it as a chess game.  Tom is trying to make me panic by taking my minor pieces in hopes that I will lose sight of the whole game.  He is playing to win.  But I have a different strategy.", "input": "", "output": "What is that?"}, {"instruction": "I think that his demands are outrageous.  Not only are they outrageous legally, but they sound insane.  With every new demand, Tom is sounding more and more like a raging lunatic.  I don't think that his manipulations will play well in court.  Do you?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know.  Law is not my specialty."}, {"instruction": "But I'm sure you've treated a lot of patients with marital difficulties, perhaps some even as part of a divorce case.", "input": "", "output": "I do...I did have a lot of patients who experienced problems in their relationships.  But as a therapist, I'm rarely put in a position to be part of the legal manipulations attendent in a contested divorce.  For example, I've never testified in court for one spouse against another."}, {"instruction": "What about in my case?", "input": "", "output": "I hope that it will never come to that."}, {"instruction": "I hope so too.", "input": "", "output": "So that's all that Tom did?  Call his lawyer?"}, {"instruction": "He started that way.  I told Kelly on Wednesday that I would be unavailable for the next couple of days and that she should just deal by herself.  But Thursday I got a ton of messages from her, including e-mail.  Friday she got hold of Rene.", "input": "", "output": "Rene knew about you and Richard?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.  I gave Rene strict instructions not to give out Richard's phone number to anyone.  But Rene called me herself.  Apparently Tom and his legal crew decided that my behavior not only clearly exhibited irresponsibility on my part but it could also be interpreted as kidnapping.", "input": "", "output": "Kidnapping?"}, {"instruction": "I told you that Tom is beginning to sound more and more like he is losing his marbles.  This is a clear example of it.  Kidnapping!  How could I kidnap unborn children?  They are part of my body--everywhere that I go, they go.  Is it kidnapping when I go to visit my parents?  How about when I go to work?  What if I go out for dinner?  You see?  I think I am playing it right.  The more insane Tom makes himself out to be the better for me.  Why should I cater to his lunacy?  I have to stand my ground.  That's the only way.", "input": "", "output": "Did you explain your position to Kelly?"}, {"instruction": "Kelly likes to play it safe.", "input": "", "output": "So she doesn't agree with you?"}, {"instruction": "She said that she sees my point but...I know I'm right, Doctor.  You'll see.", "input": "", "output": "I hope so.  So how was it with Richard?"}, {"instruction": "It was surprisingly wonderful.  We finally had the talk that you kept insisting that I should have with him.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "I told him about what Tom did--the vasectomy and all.  Richard thought that it was outrageous and that he never heard of such devious and extremely manipulative behavior.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Did you mention you had cervical problems?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe in passing.  I don't quite remember.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I also explained that while my initial reaction to him was completely genuine--that first time we met at Starbucks, I was very attracted to him both intellectually and sexually--after our first encounter I saw the possibility of becoming a mother despite Tom's efforts to the contrary.", "input": "", "output": "What did Richard think of that?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he was flattered.  He said that he never inspired motherhood before and that it was a very good feeling.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk about the other men on your list?"}, {"instruction": "Well he knew that he was not the only one.  If you remember I spent a weekend with a friend of his from the same department at SII.", "input": "", "output": "I remember."}, {"instruction": "Richard said that now he understood my motivations and that he respected them.  He also said that he wished that I had just settled on his services.", "input": "", "output": "Did you explain to him that that's exactly what you tried to avoid?"}, {"instruction": "Of course I did Doctor.  I told him that he was just one of many and that almost any one or two of my lovers could have been the father of the twins.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But Richard surprised me.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "He made a guesstimate of my due date and extrapolated to the week of conception and decided that it was 87 percent likely that he was the father.", "input": "", "output": "Of both?"}, {"instruction": "Well that's where he went wrong.  Nobody at work really knows that I have twins.", "input": "", "output": "Why didn't you tell?"}, {"instruction": "I thought that there were enough rumors already.  Well Richard guessed wrong.  He assumed that I was further along because of my size and naturally that would make him the most likely candidate for fatherhood.", "input": "", "output": "But you are big because of the twins, so..."}, {"instruction": "I gave him all the information I had--the due date for each of the twins and the most likely conception weeks.  Of course these are just rough estimates but it's all I have.  And it's all I really want to have.", "input": "", "output": "Was Richard disappointed?"}, {"instruction": "We had these discussion on Wednesday night.  Richard made me a very elaborate dinner.  He is quite an accomplished cook.  In fact, he spent the rest of the week spoiling me with little culinary surprises and exquisite service--breakfast in bed, a four course lunch, evening snacks, just on and on.  And all of this he told me was prepared with the nutritional requirements for pregnancy.  You know if Tom really wants me to have a nutritional consultant and a caregiver, he couldn't find a better candidate than Richard.  He was just terrific.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that Richard was taking such good care of you."}, {"instruction": "But as I was saying, after he put me to bed and kissed me good night, Richard left me to do some work as he said.  The next morning, he gave me a schedule which contained all our sexual encounters with their respective dates and even times.  It also had the time range for the possible conception for each twin.  He tried to include information about my other attempts at getting pregnant.  He included David and Matthew and...", "input": "", "output": "You told him about them?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'm not heartless.", "input": "", "output": "So it's SII's general information distribution system?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, it's gossip.  But the information he had was suprisingly accurate except for a missed date or two.", "input": "", "output": "Richard was recreating a conception scenario."}, {"instruction": "And he was very thorough.  I've been an executive long enough to recognize a carefully prepared numerical analysis.  At the bottom of the list there were two numbers.  They were the probabilities of Richard's paternity for each boy.", "input": "", "output": "What were the chances of him being the father?"}, {"instruction": "Quite high for both of them.", "input": "", "output": "Was he happy about that?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, he was thrilled.  More than that, he asked me to marry him.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he had been thinking about this for weeks.  That he never met a woman that he cared for more than me.  That he loves the prospect of becoming a father.  He is even more happy that he will be the father of two boys.  That when he found out that I was pregnant it all came together for him--how much he loved me and how much he wanted me and a life with me and the boys.  He even had a ring ready.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "Under different circumstances, I would have been happy and would probably even had said yes.", "input": "", "output": "Do you love Richard?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I care for him.  A lot.  But it's all wrong now.  I have a bunch to go through before I have the luxury of even considering offers like these.  And I also have to be sure that it's for me and not just for the boys.", "input": "", "output": "Well, we can return to that.  For now you told Richard no?"}, {"instruction": "I had to.  I'm still married.", "input": "", "output": "Did you give him a reason to hope?"}, {"instruction": "I think it almost didn't matter what I said.  He was prepared to interpret my answer to mean yes regardless.  I just don't know.  There is just too much to deal with right now.  Richard will have to wait.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want him to wait?"}, {"instruction": "I honestly don't know.  I thought I just wanted the twins and that's all.  But now Richard...I don't know Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "How did it turn out with Tom?"}, {"instruction": "I came home yesterday night so I don't know about that either.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  We really need to spend some time on all of this.  Shall we schedule an appointment for next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  The same time would be good for me.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  November 19th at 4 pm.  I'll see you then.  Have a good week."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.  You too.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "I'm fine.  I think the boys are getting ready to join the circus.", "input": "", "output": "Moving around a lot?"}, {"instruction": "It feels like they are wrestling and doing gymnastics in there.  You don't even have to touch my stomach--you can just see them move even through my clothing.", "input": "", "output": "Are they active now?"}, {"instruction": "Like true performers, they do their acts mostly at night and sleep during the day.", "input": "", "output": "You are getting quite big.  What does Doctor Malleson say about bed-rest?"}, {"instruction": "Oh it's imminent.  I just wish that it all would happen on my terms.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?  I know you'll do everything you can for the twins."}, {"instruction": "If Doctor Malleson puts me on bed-rest today I wouldn't hesitate for a minute.  But it's Tom.  He was really freaked about Richard and me last week.", "input": "", "output": "He knows about Richard?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it looks like I might have encouraged Richard just a bit too much.", "input": "", "output": "You mean letting him think that you are considering his marriage proposal?"}, {"instruction": "I never said that I was considering it.  I was just really flattered that he was seriously thinking and hoping to be the father of my children and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me.  You have to admit that it is a big step--a lot of commitments all at once.", "input": "", "output": "I understood that Richard was really serious about his proposal.  But I was also led to believe from our last session that you are more than flattered and that under different circumstances you might..."}, {"instruction": "Exactly--under different circumstances I might have found myself saying yes to Richard.  But now...I'm still married and...", "input": "", "output": "What about after you divorce Tom?"}, {"instruction": "That seems so far off right now.  But I'm thinking about the boys and the future.  I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago, Doctor.  It really affected me quite a bit.", "input": "", "output": "Of course."}, {"instruction": "I had dinner with Rene and Robert.  We talked about children and parenting during dinner.  Afterwards, as Rene was cleaning up, Robert came to me and said that he would like to talk to me seriously.  He pulled up a chair and sat right across from me and looked straight into my eyes as he spoke.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He told me how it was growing up without a father.  He said that he always envied other kids who had both parents, even if they are divorced.  He told me that when he was a kid, he would watch other children at the playground with their fathers and then go home and cry in his room.  He even told me that for a while he had an imaginary father.  He said that he never told this to anyone before but that he wanted me know how it really is.", "input": "", "output": "What did he do with his imaginary father?"}, {"instruction": "The way Robert explained it, it was his real father but he pretended that he was still alive.  Robert's room is full of pictures of his dad.  It's almost a shrine.  I don't know why I never really noticed that.  I guess I was never close to my dad so...well Robert told me about his fantasy.  It's quite elaborate.  Robert said that he imagined that he found his father's body and was able to bring it back to life.  But he had to keep it a secret from everyone or something bad would happen.", "input": "", "output": "Did Robert say what that bad thing would be?"}, {"instruction": "I asked him, but he said that he never really knew.  He just knew that it would be bad and so he kept his father a secret.  Robert told me that he and his father would go for walks and talk about all kinds of things.  He said that his father even taught him how to play chess.  When I asked Robert how it was possible since he clearly knew now that it was all a fantasy, Robert got really evasive.", "input": "", "output": "Did you get a feeling that Robert might still believe in his fantasy?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  He was strange about it.  On the one hand, he clearly knew that it was all a fantasy but there was also a sense of reality to it.  I'm not sure I'm communicating this right.  It was almost as if Robert believed that his father was real and unreal at the same time.  It was clearly a very difficult thing for him to do--to come to me and speak to me about all of this.", "input": "", "output": "So Robert was telling you all this because you're about to have children without a father?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  He was trying to tell me how hard it would be for them.", "input": "", "output": "Was he trying to persuade you to stay married to Tom?"}, {"instruction": "He was never that specific.  He said that he just wanted me to understand what it was like.  I asked him if he ever wanted for his mom to get married again--this way he could have a step dad.  But Robert said that while that might be nice, it was not the same as a real father.", "input": "", "output": "A real father being a biological one?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  He told me that when my sons come to him for help in finding their true fathers, he would do all he could to help them discover the true identity of those men.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ask how he was planning to go about doing that?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't have to--Robert told me that he was keeping careful records and that he would reveal them to my children if they ever asked.", "input": "", "output": "Does he have knowledge of your sexual encounters over the last couple of months?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently.  I asked how he knew.  But Robert just told me that he had his ways.  I was worried that he might actively suggest to my boys the need to find the identities of their true fathers.  But Robert assured me that he would only come forth with his information if they came to him first.", "input": "", "output": "What else did Robert tell you?"}, {"instruction": "He described some really tender moments in his childhood--when his imaginary dad came to his rescue, how they used to play together all the time, how he used to read books to him, secret Christmas presents he got from his dad...there was a lot.  It was very difficult for me not to cry as Robert was telling me about all this.  I thought that I was close to him but I never suspected...I wish I knew.", "input": "", "output": "Does Robert's mom...does Rene know about all this?"}, {"instruction": "Robert made me promise never to tell his mom.  I feel bound by that promise even though I think that she should know.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that Rene might suspect it independently--just from observation?"}, {"instruction": "If Rene ever suspected something like this, I would have been the first to know.  I don't think Rene knows anything about this.  Robert was always such a quiet child, very introspective and introverted.  He would play by himself for hours at a time.  I never suspected that he was actually playing with his father.  God, I hope this is not the fate of my children!", "input": "", "output": "Robert's revelations really affected you?"}, {"instruction": "I've been thinking about nothing else since that evening.  I want my children to be very happy.  I don't want them to have to invent an imaginary father to fill an emotional gap in their lives.", "input": "", "output": "Just because an imaginary father was Robert's way of coping with his loss, does not mean that your children would adapt the same strategy.  Robert never got to know his dad.  And because of his tragic death, Robert created a myth that helped him deal with his own emotional needs.  Your children will not be faced with the death of their father but rather with the mystery of their origins.  If there'll come a time when they ask you about their real fathers you..."}, {"instruction": "I won't be able to tell them much.  What should I say Doctor?  Should I tell them about the list?  Should I make probability charts for them like Richard made for me?  I just don't know.", "input": "", "output": "So you never really thought about this problem before?"}, {"instruction": "No it just never came up.  I was too busy trying to get pregnant and than Tom...I can just picture them going to Tom:  \"Yes, your mother was a whore.  I tried to stop her but she just went ahead and slept with every man in sight.\"", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia stop it.  You are going overboard speculating about this.  Your children haven't even been born yet.  Let's concentrate on the problems at hand, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sorry Doctor.  I'm really a lot more emotional and moody now.", "input": "", "output": "That's since you were pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "I guess.  And I think I'm also tired and that contributes to my inability to deal.  I guess I was talking about Tom when I got sidetracked?", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad we talked about Robert.  We will come back and talk about him some more in the future."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.  I hope you don't think he is crazy.", "input": "", "output": "I really don't.  Robert is not the first child to have an imaginary friend."}, {"instruction": "Sure.  You are right.  So about Tom.  Tom was furious about my stay with Richard.  He's hired a live-in nurse to watch over me.  I feel like I'm being spied on in my own home.  I've seen her writing reports about me--what I ate and when I ate, how much I slept, when I left for work and when I came home...she even brings me lunch.", "input": "", "output": "So you are still going to work?"}, {"instruction": "The nurse takes me.  I no longer have driving privileges.  It's just absurd.  I don't know why Kelly is letting them get away with this.  And I'm crazy for going along.  I just feel that sometimes I need a little break from fighting everybody all the time.  But this is what happens when I do--a live-in pest.", "input": "", "output": "I gather that you don't like her very much?"}, {"instruction": "Oh she is probably fine.  It's just that she is working for Tom and not for me.  Her loyalties are not where they are supposed to be.  You know what I mean?  I think that Tom made her believe that I'm some sort of a monster trying to murder my children.  I hate the way that woman looks at me.", "input": "", "output": "So bed-rest has been postponed?"}, {"instruction": "Not for long.  As I said, if only this was coming from Doctor Malleson, I would still hate it but I would be the most exemplary patient.  But I feel like this is all just bullshit.  Just a way of wearing me down physically and emotionally.", "input": "", "output": "Have you talked to Doctor Malleson about this?"}, {"instruction": "His recommendation is to start bed-rest at about twenty-two weeks.  By that time, the twins will be heavy enough to potentially cause problems for my cervix.", "input": "", "output": "You're eighteen weeks now?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Oh and I forgot to tell you, Richard spoke with Tom.", "input": "", "output": "Did he?"}, {"instruction": "That's what I meant by encouraging him too much.  He decided to take on the responsibility of protecting me from Tom.  He called me at home and Tom answered the phone.  We really should get separate numbers.", "input": "", "output": "So what did Richard and Tom talk about?"}, {"instruction": "Richard told Tom that he thought that he should take my rejection as a man and let me go on with my life.  Tom told Richard that a man who fucks another man's wife has no business calling and demanding favors from the husband.  He told Richard that now that he knows who he is he is going to...I don't know what he is going to do but you get the picture Doctor.  I was in my bedroom when Richard called and I could hear from Tom's voice that it must have been Richard on the phone.  It was ugly.  I had to speak with Richard the next day to calm him down and explain to him the rules of this game.  I told him never to call me at home again.  He seemed crushed by that but...I think it will be awhile before he calls me there again.", "input": "", "output": "What about Tom?"}, {"instruction": "I guess Tom now believes that Richard is the father.  Perhaps I should have a talk with him as well.  Maybe it's about time he found out about the list.  Well Doctor, it's getting late.  Same time next week?", "input": "", "output": "Same time.  Tuesday the 26th at 4 pm.  I'll see you than.  Take care of yourself Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye Doctor.  See you in a week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Well Doctor, where shall I begin?", "input": "", "output": "When my patients start their sessions that way it's usually not good news.  What happened?"}, {"instruction": "This Thursday is Thanksgiving.", "input": "", "output": "The family holiday."}, {"instruction": "That's right.  So let me start by filling you in on how the Bows' used to do holidays.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like it was a big deal."}, {"instruction": "You got it.  For a long time my mother used to do all the holiday dinners and we would all go to my parent's house and celebrate there as a happy little family.  This included Rene and Robert flying in from New York and, of course, my brother would be there with his latest flame--or victim, depending on your point of view--and sometimes even my uncle would come all the way from France.  The last three years this changed somewhat--my mom decided that it was time for me to take over the holidays.", "input": "", "output": "Did you want to host these celebrations?"}, {"instruction": "Oh it was fine.  In fact I used to look forward to these gatherings.  In was especially great on Christmas when Robert was still a little boy.", "input": "", "output": "He is the only child in your family?"}, {"instruction": "So far.  So my mom taught me how to make all the traditional holiday family recipes and we would all get together in our house.   It's a good party house--there's lots of room.  We have several guest rooms so Rene and Robert always stayed with us. Tom's parents were also getting older and, since his sister got a divorce, they would fly in from New York as well and join us for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter.", "input": "", "output": "That's a lot of people."}, {"instruction": "Yes we had a full house.  But it was happy and fun.  I like large family holidays.  Well as you can imagine, this year things will be quite different.", "input": "", "output": "This Thanksgiving will be the first holiday after your break up with Tom."}, {"instruction": "And it will be ugly.", "input": "", "output": "Obviously you can't host Thanksgiving dinner this year even if Tom wasn't a problem.  Can someone else take over your family duties for this year?"}, {"instruction": "My mom can't do it.  She hasn't been feeling well and that kind of pressure just wouldn't be good for her.", "input": "", "output": "What about Rene?"}, {"instruction": "Rene can hardly boil water and her apartment is too small to host that many people.", "input": "", "output": "And your brother?"}, {"instruction": "Don't make me laugh Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure you do yet.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Tom's parents and sister are coming tomorrow.", "input": "", "output": "Are they staying in your house?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Did you know about this?"}, {"instruction": "Well, honestly Doctor, I just assumed that given my current situation with Tom, they would not come out to San Francisco for the holidays.  In fact, I thought that maybe Tom would fly out there to join them.  Silly me.", "input": "", "output": "When did you find out that they were coming?"}, {"instruction": "Tom started preparing for their visit last weekend.", "input": "", "output": "Did you confront Tom on this?"}, {"instruction": "He said that just because I was pregnant, it didn't mean the world had to stop spinning.  He said that he was perfectly capable of hosting the dinner himself.  In fact, he told me that he invited my parents and my brother, even Rene and Robert.  Oh and I was welcome to join them as well.", "input": "", "output": "Tom's parents know about the divorce, right?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't tell them.  But I'm sure Tom did.", "input": "", "output": "And they know you are pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "I think so.  Tom does talk to them on occasion.  I imagine he would have mentioned it.", "input": "", "output": "But you are not sure?"}, {"instruction": "No, I don't know this for a fact.", "input": "", "output": "Did your parents receive a formal invitation?"}, {"instruction": "That's what they said.", "input": "", "output": "Are they coming?"}, {"instruction": "My brother is.  I couldn't really talk to my mother, she is so easily upset now that she starts crying right after I say hello.", "input": "", "output": "Is she getting worse?"}, {"instruction": "You mean is my mother feeling worse now than a couple of weeks ago?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  I remember asking you about your mother and you said that she's been feeling better.  Has that changed?"}, {"instruction": "It's on and off.  Bad days and good days.  She stopped working at the restaurant completely.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that.  I understand her business was very important to her."}, {"instruction": "She is too weak to be there now.  But she says that she didn't give it up; she's just putting it on hold for a while.  We all know better though.", "input": "", "output": "I'm very sorry."}, {"instruction": "Me too.", "input": "", "output": "So you don't know whether your parents are coming to Tom's Thanksgiving dinner?"}, {"instruction": "I have a feeling that that's up to me.", "input": "", "output": "You're planning on being there?"}, {"instruction": "I'm considering it.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I like Tom's parents and I used to be friends with his sister until all this.", "input": "", "output": "Don't you think you would be..."}, {"instruction": "Strange?", "input": "", "output": "That's one word for it."}, {"instruction": "I can try to get Rene to go and then it would be really bizarre.", "input": "", "output": "I can see that.  Rene is not a big Tom supporter, is she?"}, {"instruction": "No, Rene is not really Tom's fan.  And never was.  This has been her big opportunity to say, \"I told you so.\"", "input": "", "output": "So why would you do this to yourself and your family?  Why not just go out somewhere if cooking and hosting is too hard to do?  Let Tom take care of his family and you can celebrate your way."}, {"instruction": "That does sound nice.  But I think I'm going to do it my way.", "input": "", "output": "Your way?"}, {"instruction": "Tom's been filing a lot of petitions with the court lately citing my negligence and irresponsibility.  If he forces me into going to his Thanksgiving, don't you think it would be a point on my score card?", "input": "", "output": "So it would all be for the judge's benefit?  What about your family?"}, {"instruction": "The only ones who would really hate it are Rene and I.  My parents will probably enjoy even a pretense at normalcy.  As I said, my brother is going anyway.  And Robert likes it.  Tom was always good with him.  After our conversation last week about imaginary fathers...well I think it might be better this way.", "input": "", "output": "I have to say Sylvia this is not an evening that I think will end well.  I think you should think carefully about it before committing."}, {"instruction": "I will.  I've been thinking about it since Sunday.", "input": "", "output": "You know if things blow up--get out of hand, it would not be good for your mother or Robert.  Not to mention that I would definitely recommend that you avoid this kind of excitement yourself."}, {"instruction": "I will really think about it, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds to me like you've already made up your mind."}, {"instruction": "I will call you if it gets bad.", "input": "", "output": "I will be out of town, but of course my answering service will know how to get ahold of me if you need me."}, {"instruction": "Going to spend the holiday with your family?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  I'm going to New York to see my parents."}, {"instruction": "That's very nice.  I'll try not to disturb you.  I wouldn't want your parents to think you are working with a bunch of lunatics.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, they'll never think that!"}, {"instruction": "Of course not.  And I almost forgot.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Tom put a restraining order on Richard.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Tom put a restraining order on Richard--Richard can no longer come within 100 feet of our house.  I thought you might find it entertaining.", "input": "", "output": "Did Richard do something to Tom?"}, {"instruction": "Richard called again when Tom was home.  The conversation got a bit heated and Richard threatened Tom.  It's not like Richard would ever do anything to Tom.  It was just a convenient excuse to keep him out of the house and prevent me from seeing him when I get on bed rest.", "input": "", "output": "How did Richard take this bit of news?"}, {"instruction": "How do you think?", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Well at least your life is never boring."}, {"instruction": "True.  But boredom is good every now and then, don't you think Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Is there anything else you want to tell me about?"}, {"instruction": "Not really.  It's same old, same old.  Oh, Hal was in today.", "input": "", "output": "How was it?"}, {"instruction": "Creepy.  He kept looking at me funny and at one point even put his hand on mine--in that \"I really like being with you\" kind of way.  I shudder just thinking about it.  I don't know what that man is thinking.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure he is just trying to be supportive."}, {"instruction": "I don't think so Doctor.  But it's time for me to go home.

But Rene said that she had an assignment--a photo essay about Thanksgiving dinner and San Francisco's homeless.", "input": "", "output": "Did she show up later or not at all?"}, {"instruction": "She came after the dinner was over.  So to answer your next question Doctor--she wasn't as much of a release valve as I had hoped.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It was a very strange evening Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I still don't exactly understand why you agreed to go in the first place."}, {"instruction": "I thought it would be good.  I told you, it's like a chess game with Tom and me.  He is demanding that I stay home and rest.  But at the same time he throws a Thanksgiving dinner party with, shall we say, a controversial guest list.  Anyone would agree that having both sets of parents and in-laws for a holiday dinner during a nasty divorce would not contribute to the peace of mind of a pregnant woman on bed rest.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I've done a lot of strange things for which I will be held accountable.  And I want the judge to see just how unreasonable Tom is.  But to tell you the truth, now that it's over I feel that I made a mistake.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "It was too trippy.  Here we all were pretending like there was nothing wrong.  I've known these people longer than most of my friends.  I met Tom while I was still a student at NYU.  Just a little after that, he introduced me to his family.  I've seen his sister get married, go through horrendous infertility problems, lose a baby, lose her husband, lose her job, lose her mind.  I've stayed up nights worrying about Tom's mom after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I've watched Tom's dad turn gray overnight as he waited for his wife's biopsy results.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I've been through a lot with these people.  They are my family too now.  I care for them.", "input": "", "output": "What was their reaction toward you now that they know that you and Tom are getting divorced?"}, {"instruction": "The strange thing was that Tom's mom seemed mostly concerned that all the stress is having a negative effect on my pregnancy.  I know that Tom's parents know that Tom's not the father but they acted as if they are expectant grandparents.  I think this was the most surprising and uncomfortable thing for me.  I would have preferred them to be angry with me for cheating on their son.  But they expressed nothing but care and concern for my well being.  Tom's mother brought me gifts for the babies--she had saved some of Tom's charming little baby clothing and blankets.  I felt guilty about taking them but they insisted saying that they wouldn't think of giving them to anyone else.  Tom's sister wanted to help me by offering her extensive knowledge and research about pregnancy complications.  She said that she has first-hand experience with most of the drugs and procedures used to prevent early labor.  It was very touching.  I know how difficult it was for her to even look at me and now to offer to help me go through this...I don't know.  I don't think I would have been able to do the same if our roles were reversed.", "input": "", "output": "How was the interaction between your parents and Tom's?"}, {"instruction": "It was hard work for both of them.  Since they live on opposite coasts, there never were that many opportunities for them to get to know each other.  The last couple of years they've seen each other during the holidays.  They just don't know each other, but they could be friends perhaps under different circumstances.", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  To be thrown together in this situation would have been difficult even if they were the best of friends."}, {"instruction": "That's right--\"So congratulations on your daughter's expectancy.  Do you know who the fathers are?\"  \"No we don't.  And we are so sorry that your son gave up his ability to father children.\"  \"That's okay.  We wanted never to have grandchildren.  We look forward to our family name dying off with this generation.\"  God!", "input": "", "output": "But they managed to be civil to each other all evening?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes.  They even talked during dinner, although the main topic of conversation was the difference in weather between the East and West coasts.  It was hell.  The only one who seemed to be happy was Robert.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "You know how he is obsessing about fatherhood?  I think he misunderstood this all to mean that Tom and I might be trying to work things out.  Who could blame him?  There were some Oscar-winning performances that night around our dinner table.", "input": "", "output": "What about your brother?"}, {"instruction": "You know, the last time I saw him was when he stormed into my office about two months ago?", "input": "", "output": "When he confronted you on having an affair?"}, {"instruction": "I know he disapproves of me.  Hell, disgusted is probably a better term.  But he was on his best behavior that night.  I expected him to try to instigate a fight or at the very least to humiliate me.  But he was civil and even charming.  At one point when the conversation strayed into some rocky waters, he managed to change the topic and steer it away from danger.  I found myself being grateful to him.", "input": "", "output": "How did you feel that night?"}, {"instruction": "I felt like I was in Twilight Zone.  It would have been so easy to pretend like there was nothing wrong.  I kept finding myself almost forgetting that Tom and I are getting a divorce.  We are not even friends any more and there we were hosting a Thanksgiving Dinner right out of Norman Rockwell.  It was so surreal.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "More than that.  I found myself enjoying those moments of feeling like there was nothing wrong--like Tom and I were still family.  I was looking at him and remembering Thanksgiving dinners of the past.  We had eighteen Thanksgivings together.  God, it's a very long time to spend with someone.  I didn't live with my parents that long.  I keep thinking about how it was when we still loved each other.", "input": "", "output": "Do you still think about it?"}, {"instruction": "It's just so easy to fall back into it--it's like an old habit, like being on automatic pilot.  As the evening went on and I was getting tired, I had to constantly remind myself that this is not real.  That this is just some sick game that Tom is playing with me.  At the end, when everyone was leaving, Tom and I were standing at the door saying our goodbyes to my parents and Rene, and my brother and his date.  When we closed the door, I instinctively found myself leaning on Tom's shoulder.  It was as if my body had a memory and mind of it's own.  When I realized what I was doing I jumped away with a shudder.", "input": "", "output": "How did Tom react?"}, {"instruction": "He just looked me straight in the face, smiled, and told me that I was a good hostess.  He said that he admired just how well I held up knowing how tired I must have been.  It was this general sense that there was nothing unusual that kept washing over the evening that I found the most frightening of all.  Maybe Tom is trying to drive me mad.", "input": "", "output": "You don't really think so?"}, {"instruction": "You know the movie \"Gas Light?\"", "input": "", "output": "A husband tries to drive his wife crazy?  Ingrid Bergman won an Academy Award in that one."}, {"instruction": "Yes, yes that's the one.  I keep thinking about it Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Are you identifying with that story?"}, {"instruction": "Not exactly.  But sometimes I feel that Tom is much stronger than I am and that I could easily slide down that slippery slope into insanity.  Maybe that's what he wants.  He knows me so well.  For all those years he was the closest person in the world to me.  He knows how I think.  He knows my desires.  It would be easy for him to destroy me if that's what he set out to do.", "input": "", "output": "Do you really think that that's Tom's goal?"}, {"instruction": "Why is he being so...so nice?  So attentive?  I sit down in the chair to read, Tom brings me pillows for my back and feet.  I go into the kitchen, and Tom is there offering to make me a sandwich.  He is trying to anticipate my every desire, my every impulse.  But at the same time he is trying to restrict my freedom.  He puts me in situations that he knows will be difficult for me to bear emotionally.  It's like he wants me to be dependent on him.  I've got to get out Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "Get out where?"}, {"instruction": "Anywhere away from Tom.  Or I will lose myself!", "input": "", "output": "Calm down Sylvia.  Relax.  Sit down.  You are getting too worked up."}, {"instruction": "I think about Tom and I get anxious.  Almost frightened.  What does he want from me?  He doesn't really want these children, so what is it?  It can't be just about money, can it Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Tom is doing this all to get a better settlement?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I always thought that that was what it was all about.  But maybe it's about revenge.  Maybe he is trying to ruin me Doctor.  I do need to go away.  Maybe I can disappear for a couple of month until the boys are born.  I can go to France.  They have a very good medical  facilities there so that wouldn't be an issue.", "input": "", "output": "You can't just go away Sylvia.  Think about it.  In the custody battle, Tom would win. If you just disappear, you will lose your chess game.  It's like giving up.  You're a lot stronger than you think you are.  Look at what you've accomplished so far.  You were told you cannot have children.  And here you are twenty weeks pregnant!  You're almost there.  Don't blow it.  I think you are feeling a little anxious after a tough holiday.  Don't turn this feeling into panic.  Don't run.  Ultimately it won't solve anything."}, {"instruction": "You're right of course Doctor.  Tom would just hire detectives and they would hunt me down.  I'll have to talk to Kelly about making some kind of arrangements where Tom and I live apart.  He could even have a spy in my house if he really wants to know what I am doing.  I don't care.  I'm not planning on doing anything very controversial anyway.", "input": "", "output": "That's better.  Use Kelly to play your game for you.  That's what the attorneys are for.  And try to relax.  You really need it.  Maybe it would be a good idea to invite Rene over for a couple of days.  It would calm your nerves."}, {"instruction": "You're right Doctor.  I'll ask her.  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  And call me if you begin to feel anxious again."}, {"instruction": "I will Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay Sylvia.  I'll see you next Tuesday at 4 pm.  Let me know if you need to change our time or if you start on your bed rest before than.

Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "You're very chipper today Doctor.  Is anything the matter?  You look like a man who hasn't slept all night.

Whatever you say.  But in my opinion she is very good for you, whoever she is.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia!"}, {"instruction": "Don't worry Doctor--if you don't want to talk about it, we won't.  Now would you like me to tell you about my week?", "input": "", "output": "Please."}, {"instruction": "You know Doctor, I do believe you were embarrassed.

What did Doctor Malleson have to say?"}, {"instruction": "I'm progressing quite nicely.  The boys seem to be okay.  One is still quite a bit smaller than the other, but there does not appear to be other problems.", "input": "", "output": "And what does Doctor Malleson think about your physical condition?"}, {"instruction": "He thinks that I'm run down and need more rest.  He also thinks that I'm a nervous wreck.", "input": "", "output": "Is that why he is putting you on bed rest?"}, {"instruction": "No.  He felt that my cervix is being strained by the weight of the twins.  He said that while he is not restricting me completely, he believes that it's time that my physical activity was cut way down.  I mean way down--I'm allowed to walk to the bathroom and I'm allowed to take a shower.  But the rest of the time I have to keep the weight of the uterus off my cervix.  This means that I can't even remain in a sitting position for too long because, while that is easier on my legs, it still keeps the pressure on the cervix.

I did speak with Kelly about our current situation.  She promised to negotiate a compromise of some sort very soon.  I also realized something last week.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Tom has not gone away on a business trip in weeks.  Please understand that this is very unusual for him.  He travels all the time.  At least once a week.  And this has been his routine for many years now.  But he hasn't left town, as far as I know, for more than a couple of hours in these last weeks.  He is home every night.", "input": "", "output": "Does it bother you?"}, {"instruction": "This is part of the problem.  Before our interactions have been few and far in between, although very intense.  When he went away, I could forget about him.  I had the house all to myself and I could relax.  Now he is around all the time.  I feel that I have to be constantly on.  All the time.  It's wearing me down physically and emotionally.", "input": "", "output": "Did Kelly propose a solution?"}, {"instruction": "Kelly thought that perhaps Tom could rent an apartment.  Something really close to the house.  That way we would both get our privacy and he could still keep his eye on me if he so desires.", "input": "", "output": "If Tom moves, Richard would be free to visit you at the house.  The restraining order is to keep Richard away from Tom not you.  Do you think that Tom would want to move and..."}, {"instruction": "I see your point.  I don't know.  I hope he will be reasonable.  We're getting a divorce; there is no real reason for Richard not to see me.  In fact it would probably play to Tom's benefit if he did.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to see Richard?"}, {"instruction": "Richard provides me with a release.  He allows me to relax for a few hours and not worry about everything.  He takes on the role of a protector.  Sometimes it's annoying.  But now it feels nice.  Richard creates an illusion for me that he is going to take care of everything, including me.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you are getting tired of fighting your battles."}, {"instruction": "No, I'm holding my own.  But even a good warrior needs some rest every now and then.", "input": "", "output": "When you left my office last time, you were going to ask Rene to come and stay with you for a couple of days.  Did you?"}, {"instruction": "I just ended up staying at her house.  It really helped.  But I was good--I left Tom a note and asked Kelly to start negotiating for my freedom.  I didn't just run away.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that."}, {"instruction": "You know at one point in my life, I thought I knew Tom.  I thought we were as close as two people could possibly be and still remain in separate bodies.  But now he is an enigma to me.  I try to understand his motives and intentions but every time he does something or makes another move, I guess it wrong.  If I wasn't developing such a fear of him, I would find him fascinating.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you fear Tom?"}, {"instruction": "I told you last time Doctor, I think Tom is the only person on Earth who could drive me into madness.  I'm an open book to him.  I feel like he could do as he pleases.  That scares me.  Yet...", "input": "", "output": "What is it Sylvia?"}, {"instruction": "I'm almost embarrassed to say it--I find that sort of exciting.  It's sick, I know it.", "input": "", "output": "You told me that you think of this divorce as a game of chess.  Tom is a worthy opponent.  You find the game exciting and thrilling.  It's not sick.  It's normal."}, {"instruction": "Maybe it is the thrill of a good game.  You know I found him watching \"The Miracle of Life\" the other day.  You know that documentary Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "I've seen it."}, {"instruction": "I caught Tom watching it on Saturday.  He put it in and got it started and then fast forwarded it through all the descriptions of human conception.  He just watched the parts on fetal development.  Strange isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like he is really getting involved in the pregnancy--visits to Doctor Malleson, video research."}, {"instruction": "He also ordered what appears to be a complete collection of books relating to pregnancy and child rearing.  What am I suppose to make of that?  It seems like over-kill to me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "What's he trying to prove?  How is this going to get him a better settlement?  Or maybe it's just for the purpose of driving me insane.", "input": "", "output": "I have to say Sylvia, from your descriptions of Tom's activities it sounds like Tom is genuinely interested in these children.  It doesn't feel like his actions are motivated by revenge or a better divorce settlement."}, {"instruction": "Come on Doctor!  This is the man who had a vasectomy so that he could avoid having children.  And these aren't even his.  Somehow I don't think it's Tom's biological clock.", "input": "", "output": "Did you ever ask him why he stopped traveling?"}, {"instruction": "I try to avoid starting conversations with him in general.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps it would be good if you could try to develop some sort of communication between the two of you.  It seems like it will take a long time for your legal difficulties to get settled.  For your peace of mind, it might be good to try to understand what Tom really wants.  I'm not suggesting you become friends.  Just try talking with him."}, {"instruction": "I feel if I talk with Tom, he will use what I say against me somehow.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds a bit paranoid Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "I realize that.  But it's like that t-shirt: \"Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean that you're not being watched.\"", "input": "", "output": "Just think about it Sylvia.  You don't have to bare your soul.  Just ask Tom why he is not traveling as much anymore.  If he doesn't tell you, no harm's done."}, {"instruction": "I might ask him about that.  It's so totally unlike Tom to stay in one place for so long.", "input": "", "output": "So let's talk about next time.  Do you want me come to your house?"}, {"instruction": "I would like that very much Doctor.  Do you have a car?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Good.  It's not that far.  And I really appreciate you being willing to go out of your way to see me.", "input": "", "output": "No problem.  I'll see you in your house next Tuesday at around four."}, {"instruction": "I won't be going anywhere Doctor.  Take your time.", "input": "", "output": "Will Tom be there?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  But I don't think he would interfere with our sessions.  Why would he prevent his crazy wife from seeking psychiatric help?", "input": "", "output": "You certainly have a very particular point of view when it comes to Tom."}, {"instruction": "I've lived with him for a long time Doctor.  I have experience.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I hope you will try to talk to Tom before long.  Call me if you need to and I'll see you next week at your house."}, {"instruction": "Thank you again Doctor for being so flexible.  I'll make sure that Tom stays out of your way when you come.", "input": "", "output": "That's not necessary.  I don't mind meeting Tom."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sylvia.  Take care of yourself."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.  I hope you found the house okay.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Sylvia.  It was no problem--your directions were excellent.  You have a very beautiful house."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.  I love it.  You can see that it is worth fighting for.", "input": "", "output": "Where is Tom?  Is he home?"}, {"instruction": "Not yet.  He is rarely home before six.", "input": "", "output": "So how is bed rest?"}, {"instruction": "I've been so busy that I don't know yet.", "input": "", "output": "Aren't you on maternity leave?"}, {"instruction": "Not really.  I started to tell you last week but I guess I got diverted--I negotiated with Lloyd to work as close to full time as I can from home.  There are a couple of big projects that will be launched soon and Lloyd and I felt that it would be best if I continued to supervise the production of all the technical materials and organization of technical support.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like a big job.  Do you feel like you will be physically up to it?"}, {"instruction": "I wasn't so sure but Lloyd was.  We'll see.  In the meantime I'm fully wired to the office and I'm considering getting my secretary to come here and work from my house for some part of the day.  As you can see from my position, I can dictate a lot better than I can type.", "input": "", "output": "Well actually I'm surprised to find you in the chair.  I thought bed rest meant being in bed.  Are you sure that Doctor Malleson had a lounge chair in mind for you?"}, {"instruction": "It's a compromise.  I have to keep my feet up and remain in positions that prevent the weight of the uterus to bear down on my cervix, but other than that...I'm hoping that I can use this chair for most of my bed rest requirement.", "input": "", "output": "You're hoping for fifteen more weeks, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I think if I make it to thirty-five weeks I'll be very lucky.  Of course term would be nice.", "input": "", "output": "Of course.  So was Kelly able to negotiate some kind of compromise in your living arrangements with Tom?"}, {"instruction": "Not yet.  But Tom did something really nice and completely unexpected for me this last weekend.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "Well Friday was my last day at work and of course I didn't get out of SII until about nine-thirty at night.  There was always something more, just one last thing, you know how it is.", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "Tom called to check up on me at least a dozen times.  I told him that I'm doing the best I can, but he was furious that SII was trying to take advantage of me knowing that I was ordered to take it easy.  He threatened to call Lloyd personally and give him a piece of his mind.  Luckily for Lloyd he went on vacation to New York.  Which, by the way, infuriated Tom even more.  When I got home, Tom told me that he wants me to quit right away.  He was arguing that no job is worth losing the twins.", "input": "", "output": "Tom is right about that."}, {"instruction": "Tom is right, but he was overreacting.  It was my last day at the office and I expected it to be a big deal.  Plus I wasn't stupid about it--I got everyone around me to do all the work.  I just gave orders and directed the show.  But I had to talk with all my staff and explain the plan of action.  On top of it all, my personal secretary took a medical leave of absence and for the last month and a half it's been a chore just to find something. Sorry Doctor, I know I'm rambling.  It's just that I'm still trying to work out my job in my head.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay.  Would you like to talk about your job and all the changes that are happenening with you professionally?"}, {"instruction": "No, no.  Hopefully there will really be nothing to talk about.  But thank you.  What I would like to talk about is Tom.", "input": "", "output": "So Tom was angry with you when you got home on Friday?"}, {"instruction": "Yes and no.  He was strange about it.  He was mostly upset with SII--he felt that the company was using me and trying to squeeze every available bit of energy out of me.  Tom wasn't very reasonable or understanding.  The funny thing is that I know he would have behaved exactly the same way in my place.  Or in the place of Lloyd for that matter.  But I didn't let Tom indulge in righteous indignation for too long--I was too tired and needed to go to bed right away.  But it was Saturday morning that was the most interesting.", "input": "", "output": "What happened Saturday morning?"}, {"instruction": "I woke up kind of late and took my time getting down for breakfast.  Tom was waiting for me in the kitchen.  As I sat down to eat...", "input": "", "output": "I thought you were on bed rest.  Walking up and down the stairs, sitting down to eat--that's not bed rest."}, {"instruction": "I decided to start bed rest officially on Sunday.  I just wanted one day to adjust to my new life style.", "input": "", "output": "Doctor Malleson approves of this?"}, {"instruction": "I told him what I was doing.  And I've been very careful this whole last week.  I was doing the minimum amount of moving around and I tried to keep my legs up as much as possible.  I just needed Saturday to get my self set up--I wanted to arrange my life so that I can run it from this chair.", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  Actually I'm very impressed with your set up--a computer station, telephone, entertainment center--and that's even a little refrigerator?--all within arm's reach."}, {"instruction": "The computer and telephone set up was done by SII.  They had some experts come out last week and work this all out.  I also have a little intercom system.  I can get in touch with my nurse-guardian at any time.", "input": "", "output": "Very impressive."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.  So I was telling you about Tom.", "input": "", "output": "Sorry, please go on."}, {"instruction": "Tom was waiting for my in the kitchen.  He said that he had a little surprise for me.  He said that if I felt up to it, he would like to take me on a little shopping trip.", "input": "", "output": "Shopping?"}, {"instruction": "Shopping for baby stuff.  I had done nothing up to then.  We needed baby cribs and changing tables, blankets, bathes, clothes...just to mention a few things.", "input": "", "output": "Tom took you shopping for baby things?"}, {"instruction": "I was surprised too.  But he was right.  If I wanted to actually see the things that I was buying, Saturday was my last chance.", "input": "", "output": "You could have shopped by catalogs."}, {"instruction": "True.  But it's not the same.  Tom ordered a limo to take us to various baby shops.", "input": "", "output": "Tom went with you?"}, {"instruction": "He offered to let me go by myself.  But I thought about it and he did go to all this trouble so...", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Tom wanted to go?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  But if he was willing to come along and do all the purchasing and delivery negotiations while I did all the closing...I just didn't feel like stopping him.  If he wants to claim custody of these kids, he should do some of the...", "input": "", "output": "I'm surprised Sylvia.  I would have thought you would oppose his involvement with the twins at any level.  Did you want him to go with you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  It was really nice to just hang back and let him deal.  At one point, I was sitting in this rocking chair with my feet up and Tom was directing the sales people to parade in front of me with all the goods.  We got tons of stuff.  We got stuff we never even heard of.  Take a crib, for example.  I thought you get a crib and maybe some sheets.  Oh no.  It's a crib and then a mattress and a mattress pad and a rubber under sheet and outer sheets and a comforter and a crib bumper and a dust ruffle and a special pillow to get the babies to sleep on their sides.  And then you need the little wind-up mobile for entertainment.  These people have it all worked out--they have long lists of things they say you need and they know that you're a vulnerable customer.  I mean who wouldn't want to buy all the necessary equipment for their child?  And we were getting at least two of everything.  At some point, I was so tired that I stopped counting and figuring out what it was that we were actually getting.  When Tom saw me getting so exhausted, he brought me some snacks and a bottle of juice.  And while I ate and relaxed, he continued to shop.", "input": "", "output": "That was very nice of Tom."}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "So did you get everything you need?"}, {"instruction": "Actually I don't think I can answer that.  Most of the stuff we got will not arrive until after the new year.  But Tom didn't stop there.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "After we left this giant baby wonderland, Tom took me to a nice place for lunch.  And then there was the final surprise for the day waiting for me at home.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "As we got out of the limo, I wanted to go straight into the house.  But Tom motioned for me go into the garage first.  In there, with a huge bow and ribbon tied around the middle, was one of these four wheel drive super family cars.  The license place read \"TWINS.\"", "input": "", "output": "That was very very nice of Tom."}, {"instruction": "Yes, he thought of everything.  I have to say he made me feel very happy that day.  It wasn't so much about all the stuff that we got for the kids.  It was more about the feeling of reality that purchasing all the baby clothes and furniture and accessories gave to my pregnancy.", "input": "", "output": "All you have to do is look in the mirror if you begin to doubt your pregnancy status.  You look officially very pregnant."}, {"instruction": "I know.  And I can feel it too.  But somehow Tom made me feel very excited about.  He managed to raise the level of anticipation.  I felt like it was happening.  It stopped being so abstract somehow.  Now I have little bathtubs for the kids and I'm thinking about how it will be to wash their little bodies.  How they would feel in my hands.  Before it was all about getting and being pregnant.  Now I think more about them as little individuals.  I wonder if they are going to like the color of the sheets I got for them.  Or whether they'll like the tunes we chose for their music boxes.", "input": "", "output": "Tom changed the focus from you and your pregnancy onto the twins."}, {"instruction": "Yes I guess that's it.  Before it was all about me and how the pregnancy was making me feel.  Now I think about the kids.  It was as if something clicked in.  Maybe before I just never had time to think about it.  I felt like I was fighting the world for the privilege of becoming a mother.  But what it was actually going to be like to be a mother...I thought about it before when I first decided that I wanted to have children.  But since then I was concentrating on getting there and not really giving any thoughts to the kids themselves.  Am I making any sense?", "input": "", "output": "I think it happens to a lot of people.  They decide on the goal but then lose sight of it in the process of obtaining it.  And it's not selfishness because worrying about your pregnancy is worrying about the twins right now.  The pregnancy is everything for them and for you right now."}, {"instruction": "Thank you for understanding Doctor.  I've been churning this in my head these last two days and was feeling very guilty about abandoning my children like that.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't abandon your children Sylvia.  You just got a little wrapped up in..."}, {"instruction": "I was very selfish.  But I know I can be a very good mother to them.", "input": "", "output": "I know you will be Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what Tom wants of me, but I'm really grateful to him for what he has done.", "input": "", "output": "Did you try talking to him like we discussed last time?"}, {"instruction": "Last week was just too hectic.  But now that I'll be home all the time, I'll try.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Now when shell we meet?  Next Tuesday is Christmas Eve."}, {"instruction": "What about Monday?", "input": "", "output": "Can we make it a little later?"}, {"instruction": "How about five?", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you at five o'clock next Monday--that's December 23rd.  Take care of yourself Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "I will.  Thank you Doctor.  Good night.", "input": "", "output": "Good night Sylvia.  Don't get up--you're on bed rest.  I can see myself out."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.   I guess you heard.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Sylvia.   Tom left me a message that you were in the hospital all weekend."}, {"instruction": "I just came home this afternoon.", "input": "", "output": "How are you doing?"}, {"instruction": "I'm scared.", "input": "", "output": "You're home.  That means Dr. Malleson thought it was safe for you to leave the hospital."}, {"instruction": "I'm still scared.  If they're born now, they'd have no chance of survival.  And what short life they would have would be spent in excruciating pain hooked up to life support systems.  I couldn't even hold them.  My touch, even my presence, would overstimulate their nervous systems and make them sick.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, you are okay for now.  The twins are okay too.  It sounds like you've been reading too much. You have to be very strong now and try to keep yourself relaxed and calm."}, {"instruction": "It's so easy to say and so hard to do.  My mind just keeps wandering.  I can't get the image of a tiny premature baby all strapped up in a giant incubator fighting for its life.  I just can't bear it.  In the emergency room at the hospital, they were checking me out with ultrasound equipment and they got this really haunting picture of the face of one of the twins.  Here I'll show you.", "input": "", "output": "It's a remarkable picture."}, {"instruction": "I can't get this image out of my mind Doctor.  I want so much for these babies to be healthy, to have wonderful lives...", "input": "", "output": "Every day counts now.  Every day your boys are growing bigger and stronger."}, {"instruction": "I just have to keep my legs crossed.", "input": "", "output": "There you go!  That's the fighting spirit."}, {"instruction": "You know, I didn't even know that there was something wrong?", "input": "", "output": "Why did you decide to go to the hospital?"}, {"instruction": "Tom's sister is visiting for the holidays.  On Friday night during dinner I just mentioned that I wasn't feeling very well.  I mean nothing too bad.  Just a bit crampy but not bad enough to even take a pain pill.  I don't even know why I mentioned it.  I think I might have used it as an excuse to go to bed early and not socialize with Tom's family.  But on Saturday morning I felt worse.  Still not bad enough to call a doctor.  Just not feeling right.  Tom's sister saw me and kept asking me questions about what kind of pain it was and just how it felt.  And finally she insisted that I should call Doctor Malleson.  I thought it was ridiculous to disturb him on a Saturday morning for nothing.  But she went to Tom and Tom got very upset and insisted that we call him right away.  Doctor Malleson was on call so I didn't have to feel very guilty when he asked me to come in \"and just take a look\" as he put it.  His argument was that it wouldn't take that long to check and if it was nothing I could think of it as an outing--since I don't get to go out of the house anymore I should even enjoy it.  But if I didn't come in and there was something wrong I would never forgive myself.  So Tom drove me into the emergency room.", "input": "", "output": "Tom mentioned that you had contractions."}, {"instruction": "Apparently that was what my pains were all about.  I was having a series of rather strong contractions but since I'm still so early on in my pregnancy they just felt like light cramps to me.", "input": "", "output": "Does Doctor Malleson think that you are in early labor?"}, {"instruction": "He never used that term.  He just gave me an injection of something to stop the contractions...", "input": "", "output": "A tocolitic, Terbutaline Sulfate.  He mentioned it."}, {"instruction": "Right.  And they kept me in the hospital in the delivery ward for two days to make sure that my contractions subsided.  It was horrible to be surrounded by all these women in labor.  They were all there to have their babies and I was there to keep mine in.  I wish they had a special place for women in my situation.  Someplace as far away from the delivery rooms as one could get.", "input": "", "output": "Were you the only one who was there not to deliver?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I was too sick to ask really.", "input": "", "output": "I noticed that you're breathing rather hard and your hand is shaking.  Did Dr. Malleson tell you to expect these symptoms?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I don't know.  The nurse mentioned something about my heart beating faster while I'm taking this medicine.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Are you taking the Terbutaline orally now?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Do you want to see the box?", "input": "", "output": "Yes please."}, {"instruction": "Here.  But there's nothing on it but the name.  I got my instructions verbally.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Did you talk to Doctor Malleson about feeling this way?"}, {"instruction": "I told him in the hospital that I wasn't feeling too well.", "input": "", "output": "What did he say?"}, {"instruction": "He told me that I'll get used to it.  It was just an initial reaction and it would go away after a few days.", "input": "", "output": "Can you give me your hand please?"}, {"instruction": "What do you want to do?", "input": "", "output": "I just want to take your pulse.  Hold still for just a minute."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Your pulse is about 130 beats per minute.  That's pretty high."}, {"instruction": "Is there something wrong with the babies?", "input": "", "output": "I don't think so.  Can you tell me all your symptoms?"}, {"instruction": "I can feel my heart beating.  Even in my fingertips.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Anything else?"}, {"instruction": "It's a little bit hard to breathe.  Like there is a weight on my chest.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel a little shaky?"}, {"instruction": "You mean my hands?", "input": "", "output": "I can see your hands are.  How does the rest of you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I feel sort of weak.  But I think I'm just very tired.  I didn't get much rest in the hospital--every time I got to fall asleep, a nurse would come in to take my vital signs and check on the babies.", "input": "", "output": "The hospitals have never been known as a restful vacation spot."}, {"instruction": "No I guess not.  But I didn't really get any sleep in the last couple of days.  And I've really been worried sick--that baby face.  I can see it every time I close my eyes.", "input": "", "output": "Well maybe that's it.  When did you came back from the hospital?"}, {"instruction": "A couple of hours ago.", "input": "", "output": "Did they check your vital signs just before you left?"}, {"instruction": "I told you--that's all they did for the last couple of days.", "input": "", "output": "You probably just have to get some sleep."}, {"instruction": "If it wasn't for Tom, I'd have been eating that horrible hospital food too.", "input": "", "output": "Did Tom stay with you the entire time?"}, {"instruction": "He never went home.  They have these roll-out cots and Tom slept in my room the last two nights.", "input": "", "output": "That was very nice."}, {"instruction": "He really came through for me--dealing with all the doctors and nurses and everything.

How about Monday?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "I'll come to see you in the afternoon around four?"}, {"instruction": "Yes please.  Thank you Doctor for being so understanding.", "input": "", "output": "Try to get some sleep and let me know if you still not feeling well.

Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure there will be someone on call in his office."}, {"instruction": "If I still feel this way...", "input": "", "output": "Is Tom at home?"}, {"instruction": "I think so, why?", "input": "", "output": "I want to tell him that he should call Doctor Mal..."}, {"instruction": "I'm a big girl Doctor.  I can call myself.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Have a Merry Christmas and I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor and Merry Christmas to you to.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.   It's nice to see you.  Did you have a good New Year's Eve?", "input": "", "output": "I should be asking you that Sylvia.  How do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I've been better.  But overall, I guess I got off easy.", "input": "", "output": "How do you figure?"}, {"instruction": "When I was in the hospital last week, I thought that was it--I'd lost my babies.  I kept asking the doctor what were my chances and she never gave me a straight answer.  So I knew it was bad.", "input": "", "output": "I talked to Tom and he filled me in a little."}, {"instruction": "Tom was fantastic.  He just lifted me up and got me to the hospital and got everyone to fuss over me.  He saved my babies' lives.  I'm convinced that if it wasn't for him...oh I can't even think about what would have happened.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that Tom's been there for you."}, {"instruction": "He is more than that Doctor.  I feel like without him I wouldn't have a chance.  He makes me believe that everything will turn out okay.  I don't know how he does it, but his very presence calms me down.", "input": "", "output": "You are placing a lot of trust in Tom."}, {"instruction": "Oh, without question he's the only person I would trust or believe at this point.  I mean you too, obviously, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, I hope so."}, {"instruction": "Oh of course.  But I feel like doctors at the hospital, and nurses too, they just have too much to deal with there--a lot of patients and not enough hands to go around.  It would be so easy for someone to forget or to miss something.  And I was so out of it there.  There was no way I could keep track of what was going on.  I gave Tom my health care power of attorney--I wanted someone to be able to make decisions on the spot and I was just too drugged to make them myself.", "input": "", "output": "So you are no longer worried about Tom's motivations?"}, {"instruction": "I guess that was really silly.  I was very paranoid but I do believe now that Tom actually cares.  He genuinely wants to see these babies born and thrive.", "input": "", "output": "I got that impression as well."}, {"instruction": "I wished I had believed you, Doctor.  It would have saved me a lot of aggravation, but it's not important now.  You know, when I was in the hospital last week, I saw Tom cry.  He didn't know that I was looking--I was so sick that he just assumed that I was too out of it to notice.  But I was very touched.  It was like finding out that your very best friend you'd thought died a long time ago is suddenly alive and well and is coming to your rescue.  The last couple of days I've been seeing more and more of the old Tom that I fell in love with.  He is caring and attentive and he is there for me.  He is like a giant mountain ready to shield me from any trouble or to come to my defense.", "input": "", "output": "So what are your plans now?"}, {"instruction": "You mean regarding divorce and Tom?", "input": "", "output": "Are you still planning on going through with it?"}, {"instruction": "We haven't talked about that.  Frankly, I don't even know if he would want to stay married to me after all this.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you two have a lot to talk about."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But I want to keep focused on the babies.  They are my priority right now.  There is nothing that is more important to me.", "input": "", "output": "I think that's true for Tom as well."}, {"instruction": "I think so too.  But things are going so well between us right now.  I want to give us a chance to fully explore our options before we commit to something by having this conversation too early.  Does that make sense to you Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you haven't made up your mind about Tom yet."}, {"instruction": "I guess that's it.  I feel like I'm operating in the emergency mode and this is the kind of decision I would like to make on a clear day.  But I'm thrilled and extremely grateful that Tom is taking such a strong role right now.  He is so strong and determined that I feel like he can make everything all right by sheer will power.  On the other hand, I've been feeling almost paralyzed with terror and I'm very afraid of making the wrong decision.", "input": "", "output": "What wrong decision?"}, {"instruction": "Keeping the labor at bay seems such a delicate balance between the health of the mother and that of the babies.  I would gladly sacrifice my health to make them all right.  But it's not how it is.  I have to stay relatively healthy so these babies will get the nourishment they need from me.  The tocolitic drugs keep me sick and nauseated the entire time.  Instead of gaining weight, I'm losing it.  I force myself to eat every day.  And my mind is all cloudy.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I'm having trouble concentrating.", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be doing fine now."}, {"instruction": "Not really.  I'm constantly forgetting what I want to say to you.  My thoughts seem to be slippery and I can't hold on to them long enough to make a point.  I have trouble reading.  I have a book that Doctor Rush gave to me in the hospital.  It talks about all the drugs and all the procedures that they can do for me right now to keep my babies from being born.  There is also a large section on premature infants.  I keep trying to read all of this but I'm having trouble keeping it in my head and making connections between the ideas in the various sections of the book.  This is one of the reasons I gave Tom the power of attorney.  He is reading and researching all the alternatives so that if the time comes he can make an educated choice as to the course of action we should take.  I trust that he will make the right decision.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure he will.  You mentioned being terrified.  Are you mostly terrified of losing the babies?"}, {"instruction": "I feel guilty for saying this but no.", "input": "", "output": "What is it then?  Are you afraid of getting sick yourself?"}, {"instruction": "No.  That's the least of my worries.  What I'm mostly concerned with is the state...the medical condition these boys will be in when they're born.  I'm worried about underdeveloped lungs and underdeveloped hearts.  I'm worried about brain damage.  I read some studies before and...", "input": "", "output": "The technology advances everyday.  What was true yesterday is no longer true today.  I recently heard about a girl who survived after being born at twenty-four weeks.  She's okay and her parents are fine.  They showed her on the news.  She is a beautiful little girl now.  And that was almost a year ago.  And now you are even further along than she was--you are at twenty-five weeks."}, {"instruction": "I know Doctor.  I mark off every hour.  But I don't want to be lucky--I don't want to have a miracle survivor story that is featured on the news.  I want an ordinary, even boring, birth story--a nothing to talk about story.  Do you understand?", "input": "", "output": "Yes I do."}, {"instruction": "I want to be a boring patient--the kind which nothing happens to.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, one thing you are not is a boring patient."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But I want to be.  Actually Doctor, I'm getting very tired.", "input": "", "output": "Should we stop for today?"}, {"instruction": "If you don't mind.  I'm feeling myself slipping away.", "input": "", "output": "No problem.  I'll see you next week.  Please give me a call if...if you just want to talk."}, {"instruction": "I will.  Thank you Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sylvia.  Be well."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.   Please sit down.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "I'm very sorry about last time.", "input": "", "output": "You were tired; I understand.  It gave me a chance to meet Tom."}, {"instruction": "I heard a little about that.", "input": "", "output": "Anything you'd like to share?"}, {"instruction": "Actually I was hoping you'd fill me in.  Tom just told me that he said hello to you and apologized for my absence.  I have a feeling there was more than Tom was willing to tell me.", "input": "", "output": "It was a fairly short conversation."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I know you and I know Tom.  This was your first chance to meet Tom in person.  I'm sure you took advantage of it.  And since Tom wasn't willing even to answer questions like: \"Did you like Doctor Balis?\" I assume that your conversation was rather interesting.  So please Doctor, this is really important to me.", "input": "", "output": "Tom expressed a lot of frustration and hostility toward me.  I told him it was unfortunate that he felt that way since we both have a common goal."}, {"instruction": "What's that?", "input": "", "output": "We both want you to have a successful pregnancy and come out on the other side with two beautiful children and a sound mind."}, {"instruction": "I have to say that I've been thinking a lot about Tom and what he's done for me and I'm beginning to believe that that's his goal as well.  Just a month ago, I wouldn't have believed that Tom had any good intentions towards me, but lately...well, it's amazing how things can change in just a few days.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about Tom?"}, {"instruction": "I'm very grateful to him for what he's doing.  I've been living day-to-day, hour-by-hour.  It's hard not to do that in my situation.  And I find myself forgetting how I got here in the first place.  I'm forgetting the rage I felt toward Tom for what he did to me.", "input": "", "output": "He is not responsible for your early labor, or your weak cervix, or your bedrest..."}, {"instruction": "For that matter, he is not responsible for my pregnancy.", "input": "", "output": "True.  So the rage you felt towards him was for almost leaving you childless.  It wasn't for your current condition.  Now that it is certain that you'll be a mother, that old rage no longer has the fire to keep going."}, {"instruction": "I guess it's true--it doesn't really matter anymore.  I got what I wanted.  Or almost.", "input": "", "output": "Just thirteen more weeks to go.  You're almost there."}, {"instruction": "I know.  It's unbelievable to me.  But I still feel like I'm holding my breath until it's all over.", "input": "", "output": "That's natural.  Even women with perfect pregnancies feel that way sometimes.  But you never finished telling me about how you feel about Tom.  The rage is gone.  But what's left?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  I need time to find out.  Did Tom say anything about how he felt?", "input": "", "output": "He is still feeling a lot of anger."}, {"instruction": "That's what I thought.  We never really talk about anything other than the immediate situation.  I'm not sure if it's fear or if we are just concentrating on the problems at hand.", "input": "", "output": "Are you afraid of talking to Tom about your relationship?"}, {"instruction": "If I was Tom, I would never forgive me for what I've done.  But on the other hand, I don't think that I will ever be able to forgive him either.", "input": "", "output": "Even after the boys are born?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  Maybe it would just stop being important.  But that's just my side.  For Tom--he would have to spend the rest of his life supporting these children knowing that...I'm not sure he would be able to look at them and not think about what I've done.", "input": "", "output": "At some point you will have to discuss some of these issues with Tom."}, {"instruction": "I realize that Doctor.  But I don't feel pressed to do it right now.  Tom is willing to put all legal actions off for the next thirteen weeks.", "input": "", "output": "That's very nice of him."}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure it's that, or that until these children are born and their medical situation is fully established, there is really nothing concrete to fight about.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I don't think that's right.  There is still the ultimate issue of custody and there is no legal reason why Tom should wait to decide it.  I think Tom is genuinely trying to make things easier on you right now."}, {"instruction": "If he didn't and something happened to the kids because I was too upset, how would he be able to live with himself?", "input": "", "output": "While that might be a factor in his decision to put things off, I'm sure it's not the only thing that motivates him.  I think Tom really cares about you."}, {"instruction": "Let's not talk about it right now, okay Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, we have time."}, {"instruction": "Actually, I'm really tired now.  Do you think we can call this a short session?", "input": "", "output": "Of course Sylvia.  I'll see you next week at this same time, okay?"}, {"instruction": "That'd be great.  I'm sorry to crap out on you.", "input": "", "output": "Nonsense.  It's important for you to rest too.  Goodbye Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye Doctor.  Thanks for being understanding.", "input": "", "output": "No problem.  I'll see myself out."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.   It's nice to see you.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Sylvia.  How are you feeling today?"}, {"instruction": "Not bad.  Tired.  But I seem to always be tired lately.", "input": "", "output": "You look wonderful--very pregnant."}, {"instruction": "You should keep looking--the boys have been very active today.  My whole belly seems to have a life of its own.  You can see them move from across the room!", "input": "", "output": "Tell me when you feel something."}, {"instruction": "I will.  Tom says that sometimes it looks like I have kittens fighting under my shirt.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to see that.  So how was your week?"}, {"instruction": "It's been all right.  I don't get to get out much and being in this room day after day really focuses my attention on these kids and how my body is changing to accommodate them.", "input": "", "output": "Seems perfectly natural."}, {"instruction": "It's strange how the outside world has lost most of its appeal to me.  I don't even read the newspaper anymore.  If you told me a year ago that I would care so little about the outside world I would have accused you of not understanding my very being--of not knowing what makes me tick.  Now my whole world has shrunk to the size of my uterus.  I pay a lot of attention to every twitch and every ache.  I don't want to miss a single sign that my body is willing to give me.  You see this computer next to my chair?", "input": "", "output": "I was wondering about that.  I thought it was a fancy telephone."}, {"instruction": "It's a device that links me directly to the hospital.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I understand."}, {"instruction": "They brought it in yesterday.  I put this belt around my waist and the sensors inside it record any contractions that I may have during a particular period.  This allows me and the nurses to monitor how strong and how far apart my contractions are.  If they get too strong or happen at regular intervals, the nurses call my doctors and they decide whether to increase the dose of my anti-contraction medication.  Hopefully this device will keep the babies inside for a few weeks longer.", "input": "", "output": "So the sensors in this belt record the contractions and send them via modem to the hospital?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Except the data is first sent to this monitoring service which examines how far apart the contractions are, how many are in an hour, and how strong they are.  Then they pass this information along to Doctor Malleson.", "input": "", "output": "How many times a day do you have to monitor?"}, {"instruction": "I do three times a day.  What really surprised me was how hard it was for me to tell if I was having a contraction.  I thought it would be easy.  I thought it would hurt or something equally obvious.  But since this is still so early in the pregnancy, I feel only the very strong contractions.  They feel like my stomach tightens up like a drum and then relaxes again after about a minute.  But some of the contractions that show up on this monitor I can't feel at all.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad that there is this kind of technology."}, {"instruction": "Me too.  I'm so grateful to my doctor and all the nurses too.  If it wasn't for them...it's scary to think what would have happened.", "input": "", "output": "So now you don't even have to leave your house to get a check-up, huh?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I was sort of looking forward to my outings even if they were only to the doctor's office.", "input": "", "output": "How often did you have to go?"}, {"instruction": "Every Monday.", "input": "", "output": "So yesterday was your last time?"}, {"instruction": "For a while.  Actually something strange happened yesterday.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Well, when I was waiting for the ultrasound technician in the maternity ward of the hospital yesterday, I saw one of my writers from SII.  I sort of got a feeling that he was there waiting for me.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that?"}, {"instruction": "You might remember me mentioning Hal Mainor--one of the potential fathers?", "input": "", "output": "I remember Hal.  You didn't seem to be too fond of him."}, {"instruction": "He was very strange.", "input": "", "output": "Then or now?"}, {"instruction": "Both actually.  I had to send him home to work because he was constantly hanging around me for some reason.  And in the hospital yesterday, he was very strange.  I thought I recognized him when we first walked in there.  But he pretended that he hadn't seen us and I let it go at that.  Then Tom went to the bathroom and as soon as he left me, Hal came over.", "input": "", "output": "What did he want?"}, {"instruction": "At first it was the regular \"Hi, how are you.\"  Except he constantly was looking around as if he was expecting someone.  I asked if he was there with his wife--most men don't hang around the maternity ward of a hospital without a reason.  But he told me that he and his wife are no longer really together.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "He continued by saying just how important our evening of passion together was for him.  He said that it changed his life.  That's how he put it, \"Our evening of passion.\"  I was getting kind of uncomfortable.  He kept looking at me with these sort of pleading, rodent kind of eyes.  I kept thinking of a weasel.  He was so furtive, always glancing around hurriedly like he was about to be caught.  I guess he was afraid of Tom--that's all I can figure.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "So he's twitching around--he really is remarkably unattractive.  And then he asked if he could feel my baby.  I told him that it was actually two--two boys.  But before I could really stop him, he's down on his knees next to the chair with his hands on my belly.  You know Doctor, people ask me about my pregnancy all the time.  Somehow being pregnant gives everyone permission to touch your tummy.  Everyone in my family felt the boys punch around in there.  But with Hal...that was really strange.", "input": "", "output": "He made you feel uncomfortable?  Do you think that Hal might believe that the babies are his?"}, {"instruction": "I thought I made it very plain that they weren't.", "input": "", "output": "Do you remember actually talking to him about that?"}, {"instruction": "I thought I did.  But in any case, here was Hal on his knees with his hands on my belly looking into my face with the most bizarre expression and Tom comes back.  So I introduced them.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Hal pulled his hands away like he got caught stealing a cookie or something.  It was almost funny.  He told Tom that he was a friend and a co-worker from SII.  And then he told him that we were very close.  Very close.  I thought I was going to kick him right there in the hospital waiting room.  The nerve!  But Tom took his hand and shook it and pulled him up off his knees.  Hal finally got embarrassed and, murmuring something about meeting someone, hurried away.  I was left to explain to Tom who this weirdo was.", "input": "", "output": "Was Tom understanding?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't go into too many details.  I just said that he was a writer who worked for me and was having a nervous breakdown.  I told him that I was forced to send him to work at home.", "input": "", "output": "So you don't think Tom..."}, {"instruction": "I didn't think that Tom knows just how many men I had.  I have a feeling that he thinks that I had an affair with Richard and no one else.", "input": "", "output": "Did Tom tell you that?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Not explicitly.  I sort of gathered it from the conversations we had together about this subject.  Not very numerous, I must admit, but that's the sense I get.", "input": "", "output": "That Tom believes that there is only one possible father?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I think so.  So I don't think that Tom thought of Hal as anything but strange.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And what do you think Hal wanted from you?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he's been trying to get in touch with me for weeks now.  He said that there is something very important that he wants to discuss with me.  But it's strange--I didn't get any messages or e-mail or anything from him.  I should try to check it out.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  To change the subject just a little bit--have you heard from Richard lately?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Not a thing.  Come to think of it that's a bit odd too.  Richard is not the kind of guy who would stop communicating.  Maybe he's been sick or something.  I'll give him a call.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that's wise?"}, {"instruction": "Why not?  He was a very nice guy.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want him to get involved at this point?  Didn't he try to ask you to marry him last time you talked?"}, {"instruction": "But I would tell him about Tom.", "input": "", "output": "My advice Sylvia is that it might be better to leave good enough alone for right now.  Just let things lie.  The situation between Richard and Tom is potentially a bit explosive, and I really think it would be better to wait until after your babies are born before you stir things up."}, {"instruction": "I guess you're right Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I wanted to ask you how you were keeping up with your work at SII?  I know you were going to work at home.  How's that going?"}, {"instruction": "Oh god.  It's just the last thing I have energy for these days.  They've been very understanding at work and have really lightened up on the requests for my time.  I really need to remember to tell Lloyd just how grateful I am for his understanding how important these babies are to me.  Actually, Doctor, I think I need to stop for now.  It's amazing how tired I get in just a few minutes of conversation.  I hope you're not taking this personally.  It's not just you.", "input": "", "output": "I know that.  I know you have very limited energy nowadays, Sylvia.  I'll see you next week.  Let me know if Hal tries to get in touch with you again."}, {"instruction": "Sure.  You're the only one I would care to discuss this with Doctor.  I'll let you know if that lunatic surfaces again.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Have a good week Sylvia.  Feel well and I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.   It's always good to see you.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Sylvia.  How are you today?"}, {"instruction": "I knew you were going to ask that question, so I thought about it.", "input": "", "output": "Usually my patients don't think that's a complicated question."}, {"instruction": "It's not complicated.  I just wanted to convey the exact sense of how I'm feeling.", "input": "", "output": "Oh oh.  There's a note of your voice that's making me worried."}, {"instruction": "The babies are just fine, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "That's not what I was thinking about."}, {"instruction": "Well you can clearly read me better than most people I know.", "input": "", "output": "So what is it?  Tom?  Work?"}, {"instruction": "Actually I believe it's both.  Remember I mentioned that I sort of slipped out of touch with SII?", "input": "", "output": "You said that you thought Lloyd was very understanding of your situation and extremely accommodating to your present needs--bed rest with very few outside distractions."}, {"instruction": "Now that you say it, I can't believe that I was this naive.", "input": "", "output": "So SII is not being as understanding and supportive as you thought?"}, {"instruction": "Well I thought it was strange that I never got any of the messages that Hal--that lunatic--claimed to have sent me.  At first I was just curious.  At heart, I'm still a reporter.  So I wanted to investigate what was going on in my absence.  But I didn't want to just call and ask.  If people were really worried about me, they would keep quiet about anything distressing.  So you can see Doctor, I couldn't simply get on the phone and start asking questions.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "Look around this room Doctor.  This looks like command central.  I have three computers set up in here, two modems--one's for my hospital monitoring, but still....  I have full access to the Internet and to the SII network.  I should be able to have access to any information that I might be interested in.  And certainly to my e-mail.  E-mail is what Hal claimed he was sending me.  So I started there.  Well, guess what?", "input": "", "output": "No e-mail?"}, {"instruction": "More than that.  I've been frozen out of the SII Network.  I can't access my e-mail account.  I have two--one from SII and one personal, and the personal one I can get to.  But my SII account isn't accessible from this terminal.  I know it worked before.  When Lloyd sent his communications command squad over here, they made sure that I had full access to everything--my e-mail, SII's files and logs, SII's Intranet, everything.  Now I dial up and I get this message:  \"You are not authorized to access the requested document.\"  What's the hell!  I always had full access to everything and in my department I set my own clearances.  In fact, I always hated all this internal security stuff.  I believed that my people should have access to all the projects we were working on.  How else could they do their jobs?", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, please calm down.  You're flushed.  I don't think elevating your blood pressure can be good for you right now."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I'm more than just flushed!  I'm outraged.", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  Could it just have been a computer glitch?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I told you that I'm a reporter at heart and what reporter would stop this early in an investigation?", "input": "", "output": "So there's more?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes.  Let's move on to my personal e-mail.", "input": "", "output": "This has nothing to do with SII?"}, {"instruction": "They pay for my Internet account but they have nothing more to do with it.  It was one of the perks they offered when they were trying to seduce me into working for SII.", "input": "", "output": "So you are the only one who has access?"}, {"instruction": "In theory.  But my password is in my log-in sequence and anyone can get onto the net via my account as long as they do it from this machine.", "input": "", "output": "And that includes your e-mail?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.  Please understand Doctor that I'm a great believer in e-mail as communication.  I've been a big evangelist for it.  With e-mail, I always get things in writing.  I know if my e-mail has been received, and I have a record of my communications.  E-mail is very valuable to me and I give out my e-mail address to a lot of people.  On an average day, I probably get 70 messages.", "input": "", "output": "Personal messages?"}, {"instruction": "Some personal and some are newsgroups and listservs.  But I do get a lot of personal messages.  So when I log on, I expect to get a flood of e-mail.  But this time, with the exception of the newsgroups and listservs which I filter into separate folders, I only received ten messages in two weeks! I got three messages from Rene, one message from Robert, one message from Cassie--my former secretary, three solicitations, and two notes from some personal friends in France.  That's all!  I know that there is something going on here.", "input": "", "output": "Most people know that you're on bed rest..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, very few people know that.  Some close friends and people at work who need to know--my department mostly.  The rest at SII just know that I'm on maternity leave and it was announced that I would be working at home.", "input": "", "output": "People talk, the word gets around."}, {"instruction": "There wasn't a single message from Richard, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "He knows your personal e-mail?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  In fact, the last time I checked my e-mail I had 8 messages from Richard.  This time I had none.  Strange don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "So you suspect that Tom has been deleting your e-mail correspondence?"}, {"instruction": "Keeping track, censoring, and yes, deleting the mail that he finds inappropriate.", "input": "", "output": "That's a tough accusation.  Are you sure?"}, {"instruction": "Who else?  Who else would want to monitor my communications?  As it is, I know that he censors my phone calls--I never receive messages from Richard and hardly ever from anyone at SII.  I know that Tom is keeping me cut off from the outside world.", "input": "", "output": "If you knew that Tom was not letting you get phone calls from outside, why didn't you confront him on it?"}, {"instruction": "For a long time, I was just too sick to deal with the outside.  I told you that I even stopped reading the newspapers.  I knew that Tom set up a barricade to keep people from bothering me unnecessarily.  I even thought it was...sweet.  But it's one thing to tell people that I'm too sick to talk on the phone and it's another to start deleting my messages.", "input": "", "output": "Did Tom talk to you about people who called?"}, {"instruction": "He would always mention a few.  But he made it sound like it wasn't a big deal if I didn't call them back.", "input": "", "output": "So what is it that makes you so upset about e-mail?  It sounds as if you like the fact that Tom has protected you against stress."}, {"instruction": "E-mail is different.  When you call someone on the phone, you know someone else might answer the phone.  And when you don't get through on the phone, you know you didn't get through.  E-mail is different.  It's addressed directly to somebody.  You don't expect that the message is going to go through someone else first.  You think it's going to be private.  And when you send someone e-mail, if it doesn't bounce, you assume that they got it.", "input": "", "output": "Have you talked to Tom about it?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he was just trying to manage the flow of information--to keep the system from bogging down with too much e-mail.  When I asked why he was deleting my messages, he simply said that he had a good reason and that if there was something that I needed to know urgently, he would certainly let me know.  I know something's up.  I think that there is something happening at SII and that everyone is trying to keep it from me.", "input": "", "output": "You don't think Tom might just be jealous of Richard?"}, {"instruction": "Could be, but I'm not getting e-mail from anyone at SII.  I called my department last Friday, and my personal line was answered by this guy Nils Landors.  From what I can remember, he works in the Advertising Department.  I asked him who he was--I don't think he recognized my voice.  He said that he's running the Technical Support Department.  I asked where Ms. Bows was.

I had to get him talking, so I said that I was a reporter for Wired Magazine.  I said that I was doing a piece on technical support provided by large companies--can you imagine?--and he was perfectly happy to believe it.  Mr. Landors loved talking to me.  I don't think he's really made the transition from advertising yet.  What a sap.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Did you try to contact Lloyd?"}, {"instruction": "That son of a bitch is vacationing on his private island near Bali.  He's not due back for another week and a half.  I think that I was replaced...fired...and that Tom knows about it.  That would explain the freeze out of the SII Network, and Tom's weird secret \"good reason\" for deleting my e-mail.  What I don't understand is how SII thinks they can get away with it?  I'm on maternity leave.  If, in my absence, they give away my job to someone else, do they think I'm just going to roll over?  There are laws against this kind of stuff.  They're going to have a hell of a lawsuit on their hands, and I think they'll find I can muster up a lot of negative publicity.  I have friends, Doctor.  I'm sure they'll find my story interesting and newsworthy.", "input": "", "output": "Whatever you do Sylvia, you have to wait until after the twins are born.  I know they're your first priority and you just can't make yourself sick over work right now.  Your lawsuit will wait.

But I guess things changed.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Rene also visited my department.  She knows a few people there and she stopped by to say hello.  They told her that it's been very strange since I was gone.

From what Rene was able to gather, the main purpose of these interviews was to gather information about me.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure?"}, {"instruction": "Rene talked to several people in my department and they all believed it.

He came to me hysterical one morning saying that his life was completely ruined.", "input": "", "output": "Did he tell you what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, in detail.  Lloyd did his usual seduction thing.  He took Tony out to dinners and theater, in Europe of course--wouldn't want the local crowd to notice the relationship.  Tony even got a tour of Lloyd's island paradise.  Finally, completely overwhelmed by Lloyd's attentions, Tony declared his love.  Apparently, it was Tony's first time--he was just seventeen.  But Lloyd's fickle and has a very short attention span.  After about a month, he moved on to his next victim.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think Tony talked about this with others in your office?"}, {"instruction": "No.  It's not his way.  He was terrified of Lloyd and kept on talking about being afraid of Lloyd's goons.", "input": "", "output": "Why did he talk to you?"}, {"instruction": "It just happened.  He was working with me that morning and he was incredibly distracted.  I called him on it a couple of times and then I noticed that he was crying.  I took him into my office and we talked.  I never told anyone about this until now.", "input": "", "output": "Are you planning on using this information against Lloyd?"}, {"instruction": "Right now I don't know enough to plan anything effectively.  But if that rollerblading snowboarding son of a bitch is really planning to do me in, I guess I would find something to do with this information.  God, Tony was a minor for Christ's sake.

After he graduated from college, he managed to get involved with a group of young chemists who came up with this new super weather-resistant material.  Lloyd became a partner in the company that they started.  The material they patented became indispensable in making high quality ski suits and other outdoor gear.  In a couple of years, Lloyd was a millionaire.  He had a good head for business and made several very good investments.

So I don't know what she told Richard about that.", "input": "", "output": "Does Rene disapprove of you and Tom?"}, {"instruction": "It's not as much as that.  Rene thinks that what Tom did to me can never be forgiven or forgotton.  But she also understands my need to try to make things okay again.  She lost the man she loved very early in her life and she never managed to find anyone else to fill that void.  She raised Robert alone and I don't think she wants me to share that fate.  I used to be very much in love with Tom.  Rene knows that.", "input": "", "output": "Are you still?"}, {"instruction": "It's different now.

How was your check up with Doctor Malleson yesterday?"}, {"instruction": "The boys seem to be doing fine.

Are you being fired?"}, {"instruction": "Not according to Lloyd.", "input": "", "output": "So what's going on?  What about Nils?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, let me explain.  Lloyd finally called me back Wednesday of last week.  As always, he was extremely charming and pretended that he just didn't understand my agitation.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell him that you knew about Nils?"}, {"instruction": "I said that Rene visited my department last week and she got a very strong impression that I was being replaced by Mr. Landors.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell Lloyd that you spoke with Nils personally?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Well  Mr. Major was extremely apologetic for Mr. Landors.", "input": "", "output": "Apologetic?"}, {"instruction": "He basically told me that he was having a fling with Mr. Landors and that somehow Mr. Landors got it into his head that he would be replacing me.", "input": "", "output": "Did Lloyd make him believe that?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose.  Mr. Major is big on making promises that he never plans to keep, especially to his lovers.", "input": "", "output": "Did Lloyd actually tell you that Nils was his lover?"}, {"instruction": "He checked out the waters first--he made sure that I all ready knew about his little habit and then he was much freer with the rest of his account.  Lloyd told me that he assumed that I would be out of commission for some time.  He said that he was surprised that I was willing to do a lot of work at home given the difficulties with my pregnancy.  But he was willing to accommodate me and try to work it out so that I had the ability to work from here if I so desired.", "input": "", "output": "But he still put Nils in charge of your department."}, {"instruction": "I asked him about that.  He told me that he didn't think Nils could do much damage there--my staff is very well trained and I left at a time when a lot of the work could be taken care of without much supervision.  Basically Lloyd was trying to make Nils feel good about himself.  He even assured me that he would keep Mr. Landors away from the office as much as possible so that he would keep out of my business.", "input": "", "output": "How nice of Mr. Major."}, {"instruction": "Lloyd tries to be accommodating to everyone.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Did his explanation satisfy you?"}, {"instruction": "Of course not.  I told him that I also knew about the interviews.", "input": "", "output": "Did he know about them?"}, {"instruction": "At first he pretended that he didn't know anything about them.  But I pressed on--it's not like it's a regular procedure to question everyone in the department about their boss while she is away on maternity leave.  Nils was clearly trying to find some information and I have to presume that it was under the direction of Mr. Major.", "input": "", "output": "What did Lloyd have to say about that?"}, {"instruction": "He told me that he was amazed to hear it.  He wanted to know if I was sure about this.  I told him that he hired an investigative reporter and should know better than to try to blow smoke in my eyes.", "input": "", "output": "Did that work?"}, {"instruction": "Lloyd admitted that he might know where Nils got the idea to question my people although he said that Nils was completely on his own about this and that he, Lloyd, would have never given such an instruction to that little pipsqueak.  He even went farther to say that if Nils, \"that little cocksucker\" as he called him, was trying for my job he was in for one hell of a surprise.  Lloyd assured me that he worked hard getting me for this job and was not about to lose me over a piece of tail no matter how good he might be.", "input": "", "output": "I guess that's reassuring."}, {"instruction": "I asked Lloyd where Nils might have gotten the idea that there might be something valuable in questioning the people in my department.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, that's right.  And?"}, {"instruction": "That's where I felt that Lloyd was clearly avoiding telling me the truth.", "input": "", "output": "What made you think so?"}, {"instruction": "It's just the way he started to phrase things and the tone in his voice.  He was trying very hard to circumvent the issue.  But when pressed, he did admit that he told Nils that there were rumors about my sexual conduct at SII.", "input": "", "output": "Are you surprised?"}, {"instruction": "A little.  Who I socialized with after hours is strictly my business.", "input": "", "output": "You did break into SII's health records and get the HIV status information on every male SII employee."}, {"instruction": "Lloyd apparently knew about that.", "input": "", "output": "I found out from Ms. Wolf, if you remember."}, {"instruction": "That bitch.", "input": "", "output": "It's safe to assume that Mr. Major got the same memo."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But that was months ago.", "input": "", "output": "What else did Lloyd indicate he knew?"}, {"instruction": "He said that there were rumors that my babies were fathered by someone  at SII.", "input": "", "output": "Did he tell you why he would care about this?"}, {"instruction": "No.  He was trying to get a reaction out me.", "input": "", "output": "Did he?"}, {"instruction": "I told him that the father of my babies was Tom Bows.  And it's true.  Tom is the legal father of my boys even if he is not their biological parent.", "input": "", "output": "Was Lloyd satisfied with that?"}, {"instruction": "He seemed to be.  I also asked him about my SII account.", "input": "", "output": "I was interested in what happened with it."}, {"instruction": "He told me that they were upgrading their firewall and he would be happy to get someone to investigate my log-on problems for me.  And that was that.", "input": "", "output": "So do you believe him?"}, {"instruction": "I believe some of it.", "input": "", "output": "You still think that Lloyd is responsible for the interviews?"}, {"instruction": "I think he told a very interesting story to Nils and made a few implications...", "input": "", "output": "If Nils did some footwork, gathered some information..."}, {"instruction": "Precisely--then Lloyd would show his appreciation by giving Nils my job.  I'm not saying that that is in fact what Lloyd would have done if Nils was successful.  It's just what he could have made Nils believe.  So Nils took Lloyd's advice and started the investigation.  I also believe that it wasn't an accident that I was cut off from the SII network.", "input": "", "output": "You think that Lloyd is responsible for that too?"}, {"instruction": "If Nils wanted to go through my personal computer records...well I might be a bit paranoid there.  I don't know.  We'll see how things turn out.", "input": "", "output": "So what will happen now?"}, {"instruction": "My guess is Lloyd is going to have a little talk with Nils.  But I still don't know why Lloyd wanted to know so much about me that he would risk a scandal.  He knew I wouldn't take this lying down.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps he thought that he had a good cover story."}, {"instruction": "Perhaps.  I talked with Tom about this.", "input": "", "output": "What does Tom think?"}, {"instruction": "He thinks that Lloyd is up to something.  But he is urging me to stay out of it until the boys are born.  You know Doctor, I'm just amazed at how obsessed Tom is about these kids.  For a man who never wanted to have children, this is practically a miracle turn around in world view.  But our time is up.  Thank you for listening to me Doctor.  By the way, do you see what I mean about soap operas?", "input": "", "output": "I must admit that your story is a bit wild right now.  But don't worry, in a couple of weeks, you'll be too tired and sleep-deprived to care."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.  You always know just what to say to make me feel better.  I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "I'm all right Doctor.  Thank you for being able to reschedule for today.", "input": "", "output": "That wasn't a problem.  You switched your prenatal check-up?"}, {"instruction": "Only for yesterday.  Dr. Malleson couldn't make it on Monday.", "input": "", "output": "How are the babies?"}, {"instruction": "They're fine too.  But I've been getting a lot of attention lately.", "input": "", "output": "More then usual?"}, {"instruction": "I guess you can decide.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like there is a story."}, {"instruction": "You bet.  Remember Hal?", "input": "", "output": "Oh God.  What did he do?"}, {"instruction": "You remember him Doctor?  Good.  Well let's start with my prenatal checkup yesterday.  Hal was at the hospital.", "input": "", "output": "You told me a couple of weeks ago that Hal was there.  You said that he acted a bit peculiar."}, {"instruction": "If you can call a grown man kneeling and clasping my tummy like a religious artifact, and then telling Tom that we are very close friends just a bit peculiar.", "input": "", "output": "Okay--strange."}, {"instruction": "Well that strange man was there again.  Unfortunately Tom wasn't with me this time.", "input": "", "output": "You were alone?"}, {"instruction": "I went with my nurse.  But Hal didn't know that.  He spent the entire time shadowing me from the hospital's corners.  Since he didn't want to approach me, thank God, I was happy to pretend that I didn't notice he was there.", "input": "", "output": "Hal just watched you from the distance for the entire time?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "He didn't wave hello or..."}, {"instruction": "Nothing.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I get the picture."}, {"instruction": "No you don't Doctor.  Not yet.  Hal followed me home, blatantly trailing my car across town.", "input": "", "output": "Uh huh."}, {"instruction": "When we pulled into the garage, he parked his car across the street.  When I got to my room, I had to see if he was still out there.  I looked out of the window and there he was standing outside his car, staring at my house.  I waved hello.  Hal finally waved back, then jumped in the car and drove away.", "input": "", "output": "So you didn't actually interact with him other than waving from afar?"}, {"instruction": "Not yesterday.", "input": "", "output": "Today?"}, {"instruction": "At about noon today, my nurse brought me some lunch and told me that the bald guy from the hospital was outside the house.  Bed rest or no bed rest I had to look.  Hal was puffing and straining, trying to unstrap a ladder that he had attached to the top of his station wagon.", "input": "", "output": "A ladder?"}, {"instruction": "You know, one of those things you climb to get to things that are too high up.", "input": "", "output": "I know what a ladder is, Sylvia.  What was Hal doing with it?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry Doctor.  I'm surprised that he didn't get pulled over with that thing on top of his car.  It was a big ladder.  It looked like he could have easily taken out a window or two on his way here.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So Maria and I are both looking out the window as Hal drags the ladder over the fence and the bushes to lean it against the house.", "input": "", "output": "Your house?"}, {"instruction": "Right here.  Right up to this window.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So he's got the ladder leaning against the window, but he goes back to his car.  He reappears carrying a basket of flowers and a boom box.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "So he's got all this stuff and he starts to climb the ladder.", "input": "", "output": "With the basket and the boom box?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  He turns on the boom box and it's playing the love song from the Phantom of the Opera--\"Let me be your shelter, let me be your light; you're safe, no one will find you, your fears are far behind you...say you'll share with me one love, one life-time...\"", "input": "", "output": "I know the song."}, {"instruction": "Please understand Doctor, his hands are full and he is using his elbows for support as he is climbing up to this window over here.  He is also singing the words, exchanging my name for Christine's.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And you have to understand that Hal's is no athlete.  I told Maria to go get Tom.", "input": "", "output": "Tom was at home?"}, {"instruction": "He was working in the study at the back of the house.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Finally, Hal gets right up here to the window, looks me full in the face and sings: \"any where you go, let me go too, Sylvia, that's all I ask of you.\"  And then Tom walked into the room.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "At first Hal didn't see him.  He is busy singing and balancing himself with all that stuff up here on the second story.  I tried to help him by taking the basket of flowers which I assumed were for me.  By now, there were quite a few spectators watching from the sidewalk below.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not surprised."}, {"instruction": "When I took the flowers, Hal saw Tom.  I guess the sight of Tom made Hal lose his nerve, because he tried to scramble back down.  Unfortunately, the boom box got in his way.  Hal lost his footing and tumbled down the ladder into the bushes below.", "input": "", "output": "Ah ha."}, {"instruction": "Doctor you're laughing.  The man was hurt.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry Sylvia.  The way you described the story, I could picture it perfectly in my mind."}, {"instruction": "Actually, I was laughing too.  It was like watching a comedy show, Fawlty Towers or something.  Unfortunately Hal was really hurt.  Tom had to drive him to the hospital, completely against his wishes.  He just kept telling everyone to leave him alone.  But he clearly broke his left leg and the boom box hit him on the face giving him a bloody forehead and a black eye.  Tom insisted on taking him to the emergency room.", "input": "", "output": "Poor Hal."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know what he was thinking.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I think he was trying to propose marriage.  But I'm married.  I told him I was married.  He saw me with Tom at the hospital.  What other proof does he need?", "input": "", "output": "You did have an affair with the man."}, {"instruction": "I had a one night stand.  And I've been regretting it ever since.", "input": "", "output": "It clearly meant more to Hal."}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.  I get a feeling that it's about something else.  Maybe he is going through a mid-life crisis.  Except that I'm way too old for that.  It would make more sense if I was some twenty-two year old lemon tart.", "input": "", "output": "Is Hal still at the hospital?"}, {"instruction": "Tom didn't get back yet, so I assume so.", "input": "", "output": "Did Tom know what he was doing at your window?"}, {"instruction": "It was pretty obvious.", "input": "", "output": "Yes I guess so.  Is Tom angry?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  I think he knows that I'm completely uninterested in Hal.  Tom is probably more sympathetic then anything else.

Are you feeling okay?"}, {"instruction": "It's been a hard week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "The twins?"}, {"instruction": "That too.  I'm getting very tired now.  Days seem to grow longer and harder.  Sometimes I feel like this pregnancy will never end.", "input": "", "output": "You're at 34 weeks for one and 32 for the other.  I think the end is nearer than you think."}, {"instruction": "I try to look at it that way too.  But I'm just so big and so uncomfortable.  And I'm understating the uncomfortable.  But it's not just that.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "It's Tom.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And it's Richard.  It's like they waited for this week...god, don't they have any compassion?  I was beginning to feel like Tom really cared about me and the boys.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Just everything.  Well it started with Richard showing up at Rene's.", "input": "", "output": "What did he want?"}, {"instruction": "He wanted to know just exactly what was going on between Tom and me.", "input": "", "output": "At one point we discussed that you and Richard needed to have a talk about your situation.  You never did that?"}, {"instruction": "No.  It just never happened.", "input": "", "output": "So what did Rene say to Richard?"}, {"instruction": "Basically she told him that, against her better judgment, Tom and I are attempting to reconcile.  Rene said that even though she was against it, I wanted to reconcile to create a family for the boys.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like Rene is really against this."}, {"instruction": "She is.  And she let her opinion be known.  But she does think that we need to put some kind of closure on our relationship, just for our own peace of mind--even if it won't work.", "input": "", "output": "So trying to make it work is putting closure on a relationship?"}, {"instruction": "Rene really means well and I hope, with time, she'll see that she might have been wrong about this.  Although the whole thing is rather moot.", "input": "", "output": "Moot?  I interrupted your story.  How did Richard react?"}, {"instruction": "Rene said that he turned ashen and stood there completely frozen until Rene finished telling him about Tom and me.  Then he thanked her and left.", "input": "", "output": "Did he try to contact you?"}, {"instruction": "He called me that evening and asked if I loved Tom.", "input": "", "output": "What did you tell him?"}, {"instruction": "I told him that if he wanted to know if I wanted to get back together with Tom, the answer was yes.  He hung up.", "input": "", "output": "But you never answered his question Sylvia.  Do you love Tom?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor you keep pressing me on this issue too and for now I don't...I just don't want...let's just drop it.  Really Doctor, I don't want to talk about it.", "input": "", "output": "At some point you will have to answer this question, even if only to yourself."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But not now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Let's move on.  I'm rather surprised that Richard let you go just like that.  Didn't you tell me that he believes that the twins are his?"}, {"instruction": "Richard didn't let it go at that, Doctor.  He is suing me for the custody of the boys.", "input": "", "output": "What?!"}, {"instruction": "Richard thinks that he can prove that he is the genetic father of my twins.", "input": "", "output": "But since you were and are still legally married to Tom..."}, {"instruction": "His argument is that I made him believe that Tom and I were in the process of getting a divorce.  And that I accepted his marriage proposal.", "input": "", "output": "Did you?"}, {"instruction": "Of course not.  Sure we...he talked about it.  But I was and am still married to Tom and I hope to stay that way.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that Richard has a chance of getting the twins?"}, {"instruction": "Oh God.  I don't know.  He is using the same arguments as Tom--I'm irresponsible, I'll jeopardize the happiness of these children by keeping them in a loveless home, and so on.  Richard even implied that Tom might do harm to them as a revenge for my indiscretions.  And then he listed most of the men I slept with and the approximate dates.", "input": "", "output": "I don't see how that information is in his favor."}, {"instruction": "His suit is full of tables of probabilities with the conclusion that he, Richard, is the only possible father.", "input": "", "output": "Wouldn't the DNA testing prove that conclusively?"}, {"instruction": "It probably would.  But I think he has to try to convince the judge there is a reason to go that far.  But I don't really care about that right now.", "input": "", "output": "It's Tom, isn't it?"}, {"instruction": "He saw the suit.", "input": "", "output": "I imagine he didn't take it well."}, {"instruction": "It's worse than that Doctor.  For some bizarre reason he assumed that Richard was the only one.", "input": "", "output": "The only one who could be the father?"}, {"instruction": "No.  The only one period.", "input": "", "output": "You mean Tom thought that you only had one affair--with Richard?  And that there was no one else?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know why he thought that.  I never said anything to indicate that I chose Richard as the father.  I specifically wanted the parenthood of the babies to be ambiguous.  I didn't even keep track--I didn't want to know who the father was.", "input": "", "output": "But Tom thought you chose Richard."}, {"instruction": "I don't know why it should be such an issue.  I would think that having multiple one-night stands is better.", "input": "", "output": "Better for Tom?"}, {"instruction": "Sure.  It proves that I didn't particularly care about any of them.", "input": "", "output": "Tom clearly doesn't see it that way.  Maybe that's why Richard put in that information--to try to break up your reconciliation with Tom."}, {"instruction": "It's like Tom lost any feelings or respect he had for me just by looking at that stupid chart.  He said that he had tried desperately to understand me and to forgive me.  But that now there was nothing to forgive--I was nothing more that a whore and had just acted my nature.  Doctor, he was so cold, so distant.  It's like the bridge that we were so carefully building collapsed with one stroke into an impassable chasm.  He told me that he wishes me luck with the birth and that once they're born he fully intends taking custody of the boys.  He said that I could stay here at the house until I go into the delivery and that he expects that I won't come back here after I leave the hospital.  I feel like my head is about to explode, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Did you try to talk to Tom again?"}, {"instruction": "He left.  I don't know where he is.  I keep saying to Maria that I desperately need to speak with him.", "input": "", "output": "You think Maria knows where Tom is?"}, {"instruction": "He hired her.  I assume she tells him everything.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I don't know what to do, Doctor.  I feel helpless--completely out of control.  I want to go look for him but I'm trapped here.  Trapped!", "input": "", "output": "Look, Sylvia.  I know you feel overwhelmed right now.  But your priority is still the twins.  You have to take a deep breath and put this on hold for the next couple of weeks until they are born.  All of this...no, look at me Sylvia!  All of this, Tom and Richard, can wait.  Tom is reacting to unexpected news.  He'll get over it.  He needs time to appreciate the situation and learn to live with it.  His current reaction is not necessarily how he'll end up thinking and feeling on this issue.  But he needs time.  Let it be for now.  Concentrate on the boys."}, {"instruction": "It's easy for you to say this, Doctor.  But...", "input": "", "output": "That's not important.  You know that.  You are an extremely intelligent woman, Sylvia.  Please try to look at your situation from another perspective.  You and Tom were beginning to find each other again.  Tom is reacting to something that happened in the past and that he was already willing to forgive you for.  Just let it rest for now."}, {"instruction": "You make me feel better, Doctor.  But when you're gone and not by my side talking to me and calming me down, I'll have to face another night alone.", "input": "", "output": "I know it's hard, Sylvia.  But you can do this.  You can get though it."}, {"instruction": "I know it's going to sound comical Doctor, but I've got to get some food.  Let's just end now.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, if you like.  Just please call me, day or night.  I promise to be here for you."}, {"instruction": "Thank you Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Sylvia.  If I have an opportunity to talk to Tom, do I have your permission to talk about some of these issues?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, Doctor.  That would be great.  Explain it to him, won't you?", "input": "", "output": "Let me think about it, Sylvia.  But I really think you need to relax.  I'm not sure if Dr. Malleson would approve, but I don't think a glass of wine each night would be amiss."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.  Goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.  Thanks for rescheduling for today.  Although I'm tired today, I just felt too exhausted yesterday.", "input": "", "output": "I understand, Sylvia.  Anything I can do to accommodate the mother of twins.  Hi, Roald.  He's changed a lot in just one week.  Looks like he is gaining weight fast."}, {"instruction": "Him and his brother both.  Grant is doing so well that they are thinking about releasing him early.", "input": "", "output": "That's wonderful news, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I can't wait.  It's been a very long week.  I don't think I got more then two hours of continuous sleep the entire time.  And that was only because Tom took pity on me and fed Roald formula instead of me.", "input": "", "output": "So the hospital didn't let you stay?"}, {"instruction": "No.  We stretched it out to Friday afternoon, and then we had to leave.  But Tom managed to set up camp in one of the waiting rooms near the Infant ICU.  Labor and Delivery lent us a fold-away cot and we brought in a porta-crib.  But it is very difficult.  There is little privacy and I'm still very sore from the delivery.  But at least we could be with both boys.", "input": "", "output": "The hospital allowed you to stay in the waiting room all this time?"}, {"instruction": "We never asked.  The nurses seem to be very understanding of our predicament and, for the most part, leave us alone.  You don't mind if I feed Roald, do you?  I'd rather he ate this way.  I do too much pumping as it is.", "input": "", "output": "Go right ahead.  I told you that you wouldn't be shy about this for long."}, {"instruction": "That's true.  But most people are pretty good about this.  I have to pump my breasts for milk to feed Grant--he is still having problems suckling.  I do it in the waiting room and, as you can imagine, it's not the kind of thing that one wants to do in public.  But everyone understands.  People leave the room, or pretend to look away, trying to give me at least a perception of privacy.", "input": "", "output": "So you spend most of your time here at the hospital?"}, {"instruction": "About eighty percent.  And I'm tired as hell.  I look like shit.  And I feel myself falling asleep in mid-thought sometimes.  There were a few times when I didn't know what was a dream and what actually happened.  I could swear I had certain conversations with Tom--they were nothing serious, just about feeding schedules for the boys and something about my mother...I don't remember now.  But Tom said that they never happened.  It's not a big deal, Doctor.  I feel like I'm just rambling on.  I'm sorry.  I'm just dead tired.", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  It's not uncommon to mix real events with realistic day dreams in the state of exhaustion that you seem to be in.  So don't worry about it.  You're not losing your mind."}, {"instruction": "I didn't think I was.  But thank you for your confidence, Doctor.  It's not like I don't have reasons to go over the deep end.", "input": "", "output": "The usual or is it something I don't know?"}, {"instruction": "Richard showed up at the house over the weekend.", "input": "", "output": "At your house?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently he called the hospital first and they told him that I was discharged on Friday.  So he went there.", "input": "", "output": "What did he want?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he wanted to see the children.  He still thinks that he is the natural father and he's claiming that he has rights.", "input": "", "output": "Did you let him in?"}, {"instruction": "Tom was at the hospital, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to talk with Richard.  I introduced him to Roald.", "input": "", "output": "How was that?"}, {"instruction": "For all his incredible annoying qualities and self-righteousness, Richard was surprisingly good with Roald.  He has that magic touch with babies.  But when I tried to talk to him seriously about the whole situation, he got really excited and stormed out.  I wanted to make Richard understand that I saw my future with Tom.  I really want to be with Tom for the rest of my life, despite all that's happened between us.", "input": "", "output": "Richard didn't take rejection well?"}, {"instruction": "No one takes rejection well, Doctor.  Richard accused me of selfishly using people  for my own personal gain.  I can't say that I don't agree with him.  I did use him.  I wanted his sperm and, frankly, I wanted his companionship at a time when I thought my world was falling apart.  Richard was happy to provide both in ample quantities.  But now I wish he would be a gentleman and go away quietly.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think Richard will do that."}, {"instruction": "No.  I know he filed more papers. He is trying to get visitation rights while he is battling for custody of the boys.  And while his lawsuit is absurd, he might be able to rationalize his rights to visit and \"bond\" with the boys, as he put it, while final decisions are being made.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "When Richard left the house on Saturday, he said that he was going to the hospital to see Grant.  Tom didn't say a word to me about that visit.  But one of the ICU nurses told me that Richard claimed that he was the father in front of the whole nursing staff.  Tom apparently got pretty ticked off, but when Richard tried to touch Grant, Tom got violent.  Security was called and I guess they didn't want to decide between the two of them, so they threw both of them out for being disruptive.  On top of all this Hal showed up.", "input": "", "output": "Hal?"}, {"instruction": "I was here at the hospital.  He was actually very nice and apologized for embarrassing me with his balcony scene theatrics.  But before he saw me, he went over to visit Grant.  They asked him if he was a relation to Grant and he said that he was the father.  I can just imagine the rumors flying about the hospital.  I was a strange enough case--twins with two gestational ages--everyone talked about that.  But now three men are battling over paternity.  I won't be surprised if I get a call from Oprah.", "input": "", "output": "How is Tom talking all this?"}, {"instruction": "We don't talk about it.  In fact we pretend like there is absolutely nothing strange going on.", "input": "", "output": "That doesn't sound too healthy."}, {"instruction": "Tom's big on repression.  And frankly, I don't mind much right now.", "input": "", "output": "You've got to start working things out with Tom.  Talk to him about your feelings.  Ask him about his.  This is not going to go away by itself, Sylvia.  You've got to find a way for both of you to come to terms and live with this situation."}, {"instruction": "I tried talking with Tom.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He knows when I'm about to bring it up and changes the conversation abruptly or finds a reason to leave.  I don't think he's looked me in the eyes once since he found out about the affairs.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sure?"}, {"instruction": "At first I thought I was just imaging it.  But I've tried to make him look at my face--look at me--and he's managed to avoid it every single time.  Mind you, he's not being obvious about it, Doctor.  He just doesn't look at me somehow.", "input": "", "output": "Are there other changes in Tom behavior toward you that you've noticed?"}, {"instruction": "When we talk, it always seems to be about the children.  You'll probably think that I'm paranoid, but it's like Tom can be with me, even touching me, and still be avoiding me at the same time.", "input": "", "output": "Tom has a lot of things to think about and figure out."}, {"instruction": "Thank you for not attributing these observations to my exhaustion or paranoia.", "input": "", "output": "I do think that both of you are extremely tired.  Physically and emotionally.  I predict things will improve dramatically once Grant is home and you don't have to put up with the madness of living with a newborn baby in a hospital waiting room.  I'm not sure I would fare well in these circumstances."}, {"instruction": "You're probably right, Doctor.  Tom seems to be so attached to Grant.  When he is well enough to take home, I think Tom will be able to relax a bit.  Sometimes I think that Tom feels so much empathy for Grant that he feels everything Grant feels--the tubes, the shots, the machines.", "input": "", "output": "You sound unhappy about that."}, {"instruction": "I'm not.  I want Tom to bond with the kids.  I want him to feel like he is their one and only father.  It's just that Tom spends all his time with Grant.", "input": "", "output": "Grant needs him more than you and Roald right now."}, {"instruction": "You think that I'm jealous of Grant.  I'm not.  I'm just...I don't know what I feel.  It's nothing.  It's good that Grant has Tom to care so much about him.  I mean...I care about him too.  But I have two--Grant and Roald.  Oh, this all sounds so insane.  I really should go anyway.  I need to get to the ICU before they'll feed Grant without me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want me to go with you?"}, {"instruction": "No thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I'll see you next week, Sylvia.  Good luck."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.  You're looking a bit withered today.  Are you getting enough sleep?  How are you feeling?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Sylvia.  I didn't realize I looked that bad."}, {"instruction": "No, no...", "input": "", "output": "I've been sick this weekend.  But don't be worried--I wouldn't come here if I thought I was still contagious.  It wouldn't be good to infect my own patients."}, {"instruction": "What was wrong with you?", "input": "", "output": "It was the flu.  Professionally speaking, I don't recommend it."}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm sorry to hear you were sick, and over a holiday weekend too.  I guess you didn't fly out to New York to visit with your parents.", "input": "", "output": "It wouldn't have been a good idea."}, {"instruction": "I bet they miss you.  I know I'd miss my boys if they lived so far away from me.", "input": "", "output": "It's not really an issue for a few years."}, {"instruction": "I was told that they'll be off to college before I even have a chance to notice that any time has passed.  Already they are so big.  Even Grant is beginning to suckle on his own and has gained a lot of weight.  He doesn't look like a preemie anymore.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that.  Is he home?"}, {"instruction": "We took him home this weekend.  Just in time for Easter Sunday.  My whole family came over.  My mother cooked the holiday dinner and my father, Rene, and Robert hovered over the kids.  Even my brother was here.  It was very nice.  Here, I have some photos for you.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  I'm very happy for you, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.  I do feel like things are getting a bit better.", "input": "", "output": "How are you and Tom doing?"}, {"instruction": "It's still very strained between the two of us.  But he moved out of the guest bedroom on the first floor and into the second bedroom upstairs next to the nursery.  So I guess it's an improvement.", "input": "", "output": "Tom doesn't sleep with you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  We haven't shared a bed since July of last year, when I threw him out of our room.", "input": "", "output": "So you haven't been intimate since?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Tom's avoiding me somehow.", "input": "", "output": "You told me last time that Tom would only touch you in a kid-related context."}, {"instruction": "I keep trying.  During Easter dinner, I kept trying to get close to him.  I thought that amid all the family warmth and celebration--we celebrated the twins homecoming--Tom would just forget and slip into my arms.", "input": "", "output": "The way you forgot yourself during the Christmas holidays?"}, {"instruction": "Something like that.  But Tom seems to constantly be aware of where I am and what I'm doing.  He's very pleasant to my family, even Rene.  But somehow he never lets go.  I really hoped that, after Grant came home, things would be different.", "input": "", "output": "It's only been four days."}, {"instruction": "It seems longer.  Especially at night.  During the day, things at least appear to be normal--we care for the boys, we play with them, we do our business.  But at night, when we go to our separate rooms...sometimes when I lie in my bed breast-feeding, I look out the window and see the trees in our garden.  The shadows of their branches and leaves form faces in the dark.  They are not friendly faces and I feel so alone then.  I hold the baby close to my body and feel his heart beat and cry.", "input": "", "output": "Does this feeling of loneliness and despair come frequently?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I cry every night.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Are you still taking your medication?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't been very good at it lately.  I guess during our stay at the hospital I sort of just let it go.", "input": "", "output": "You mean you stopped taking it all together?"}, {"instruction": "Don't be angry with me, Doctor.  It just wasn't the uppermost thing on my mind.  And Tom was worried about Grant--the last thing he needed was some contaminated milk.", "input": "", "output": "If you were worried about breast-feeding, you should have told me or Doctor Malleson.  In fact, it's not an issue, it doesn't cross over into breast milk, and you should start taking it regularly again.  Don't you think that your crying spells and depression could have something to do with you not taking your medication?"}, {"instruction": "Frankly, Doctor, I just assumed it was due to my current situation and not because I stopped taking the drugs.", "input": "", "output": "Next time you want to make a pharmaceutical decision,  please consult me first.  I noticed a little edginess in your behavior last time.  This explains it.  Please Sylvia, I can't force you to take your medication.  I can only tell you what I think is best for you in the exercise of my professional judgment."}, {"instruction": "You really think that it's okay for the boys?", "input": "", "output": "It's fine.  And your milk quality will improve once you're not so distressed and upset all the time."}, {"instruction": "So I've been producing sour milk all this time.  Roald and Grant might not like the normal stuff now that they are used to the \"psychologically defective\" kind.", "input": "", "output": "They'll adjust.  Now let's get back to Tom."}, {"instruction": "I was just beginning to feel better.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Since Tom made you stay home last November, has he ever tried to kiss you?"}, {"instruction": "In the beginning, I was too angry at him for forcing me onto bedrest and declaring me an unfit mother.", "input": "", "output": "But after a while you started to realize that you and Tom were still in love with each other."}, {"instruction": "After a while.  But the whole situation was still so strange.  And I was feeling very sick.  And we were both worried about the boys.  Tom was treating me as if I was the most fragile thing in this world.  I think he was afraid of holding me too tight, of touching me the wrong way.", "input": "", "output": "So there was an attempt at getting intimate at that point?"}, {"instruction": "The pregnancy and the well being of the twins was paramount.  Our whole lives became just about that for awhile.  And then when Richard filed the paternity suit...well you know what happened.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want Tom to be that close to you again?  Do you want him to make love to you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I know that I can't engage in any sexual activities for about six weeks after the delivery.  But I at least want to know that Tom desires me.  That he wants to make love to me when it's okay to do it.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell Tom that?  Does he know that that's what you want?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't actually come out and say it.  If he is really so disgusted by me that he can't stand touching me, how can I come out and ask him?  I'm not prepared to hear Tom tell me off.  I don't want Tom to come right out and reject me.", "input": "", "output": "You're hoping that somehow Tom will change his mind and..."}, {"instruction": "I try telling him that I want him in other ways.", "input": "", "output": "What do you do?"}, {"instruction": "I know my body is not what it used to be before pregnancy...", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, you're a very beautiful woman.  You have nothing to worry about."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.  You're very kind.  But I see myself in the mirror... I still try.  I try to dress provocatively.  At night, when Tom and I are taking care of the boys, I make sure that Tom can see me.  When I breast-feed, I try to position myself so that Tom will have a good view.  I know that breast-feeding is not the sexiest thing in this world, but it's the only way I can get Tom to look at my breasts.  I even offered to let him taste some of my milk so that he would know what our boys are getting.", "input": "", "output": "Did he accept?"}, {"instruction": "No, he declined my offer.  If I did what I'm doing now before our break-up, Tom would have been all over me.  We were very passionate together, Doctor.  Tom had a very good imagination and we did a lot of creative sexual playing.  But now he doesn't even notice.  I don't even catch him looking at me.  I think that when Tom found out how many men I actually slept with, he became completely unable to see me in that way.  I'm worried, Doctor, that if this doesn't change, we'll never be able to be together again.", "input": "", "output": "You think Tom would want to leave you?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I don't know.  But I don't want to be with Tom just for the sake of the boys.  I want him for me.  I want our passion back. I just want to be close to him again.  Look, Doctor, I'm just too upset right now to talk.  Let's schedule our next meeting and call it a day.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "All right.  But I want you to start taking Sinequan again."}, {"instruction": "I will, I promise.", "input": "", "output": "Okay then, I'll see you next week--Tuesday at four."}, {"instruction": "I'd like to come to your office, if you don't mind.", "input": "", "output": "No problem.  I was just accommodating you."}, {"instruction": "I know.  But I think it'll be good for me to get away from here, if just for an hour, to talk to you.", "input": "", "output": "Then I'll see you in my office next Tuesday at four."}, {"instruction": "Good.  Thank you, Doctor.  Have a good week and I hope you feel better.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you.  Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Sylvia.  And how are you doing today?"}, {"instruction": "How do you think?", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "I found out about the article last Sunday morning--one of the guests at the bed and breakfast we were staying in recognized my name and asked if the story in the Chronicle was true.  Imagine my shock: \"What story?\"  Tom told me that he let you know about it the day we left.  Now I know the reason for the romantic get-away--not very romantic.", "input": "", "output": "On the contrary, Tom tried to isolate you from the article and all that followed.  He whisked you away to Sonoma out of love.  I think it's very romantic."}, {"instruction": "I have a bad headache.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry."}, {"instruction": "It's not your fault.  When we came back from the trip last night, we had over fifty messages on our voice mail.  It seems the whole world saw the article and wanted to let me know.  I got a message from my mother.", "input": "", "output": "I wondered about that.  Your parents never really knew, did they?"}, {"instruction": "It's not the kind of thing you discuss with your mother and father.  My dad doesn't want to talk to me.  He said that he has to first be able to incorporate the information into his \"life's framework.\"", "input": "", "output": "What does that mean?"}, {"instruction": "My mother said that he feels personally humiliated.  She said that he is seriously considering selling the restaurant and going to France for awhile--\"anywhere where no one knows about this.\"", "input": "", "output": "I see.  How is your mom taking it?"}, {"instruction": "She doesn't understand why I did it.  She said that she always expected things like that from Rene--but from her own daughter.... I think she'll get over it for the sake of the boys.  She absolutely adores them.", "input": "", "output": "That's good."}, {"instruction": "But our relationship, I'm afraid, will never be the same.  She stopped by this morning \"to visit with her little dears.\"  She hardly said a word to me and never looked me in the face.", "input": "", "output": "It's the initial shock.  It will get better with time."}, {"instruction": "You always say that, Doctor.  But look at my relationship with Tom: it's not getting any better.", "input": "", "output": "I think you might be wrong about that.  Tom keeps proving to you over and over just how much he really cares about you.  I think you are just getting too lost in the day-to-day interactions to notice the big picture--Tom loves you.  He's protecting you.  He's taking care of both you and the boys.  Ultimately, those are the important things."}, {"instruction": "I was so happy when he suggested that we take the boys and the nanny and go away, just the five of us, for a few days.

But I would rather he opened up to me, told me everything.  If he would just drop his guard and let go.  If he talked to me, showed me the article instead of hiding it, told me how he felt--angry, frustrated, humiliated, I don't care.  Just talk to me!  I feel all these emotions too.  I'd understand.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps Tom is waiting for you to start opening up to him first."}, {"instruction": "I keep trying, but nothing.  Tom's put up inpenetrable walls all around himself and I can't seem to be able to scale them.  I think if we just made love again--got that close to each other--the walls would fall.  But as hard as I try...", "input": "", "output": "You're trying to use sex as a way of getting close to Tom again.  But for Tom, I think, sex is just a reminder of a painful past.  Tom thinks that you used sex as a tool to get what you wanted.  How does he know that it's any different with him now?"}, {"instruction": "Well, isn't it obvious?  I never formed a relationship with any of the men I've been with.  It's true, I used them to get pregnant.  But I purposely tried to keep the identity of the father ambiguous.  Tom should feel better that I had so many partners.  It makes it less personal.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think Tom sees it that way."}, {"instruction": "If Tom had an affair that lasted for years and was based on real feelings between him and the woman, I would be devastated.  But a series of one-night-stands is clearly not about love.  That's just lust.  That I can understand and even forgive.", "input": "", "output": "Even?"}, {"instruction": "What I did wasn't about lust.  It was about getting pregnant.", "input": "", "output": "As I remember, you did enjoy your encounters at the time."}, {"instruction": "When my children ask about what happened, I want to be able to tell them that I cared for and respected these men.  The fathers of my boys had to be men I admired and thought had characteristics I would want to see in my children.  Otherwise I would have just used a sperm bank.  But I couldn't rely on the information that men who sold their sperm provided about themselves.  Those men didn't care about where their kids would end-up--what kind of family would raise them; whether there would be enough resources to take care of them; or if they ended up in an abusive household.  Men who care so little for their children shouldn't be allowed to procreate at all.", "input": "", "output": "But what should families with infertility problems do?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  We each find our ways.  I found mine.", "input": "", "output": "Your way was to take what you needed without permission.

I was legitimately married to Tom at the time and so the children...plus no one objected to not using condoms, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "You made Richard your confidant.  If you never wanted him to get so involved, you should have kept your distance."}, {"instruction": "I was so angry at Tom then.  I needed someone.  Richard was there and for a while he was a good friend.  I don't know what he is trying to gain by all this now.  He must know that he can never win a custody battle against Tom and me.  Why is he making my life so miserable?", "input": "", "output": "Maybe it's Richard's way of trying to break you and Tom up.  You have to admit that filing such a controversial lawsuit was bound to cause problems in your relationship with Tom."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.  I heard that Richard got into a fist fight with Nils at SII.", "input": "", "output": "I heard that too.  The rumors were that Nils was upset with Richard for naming him in the lawsuit against you."}, {"instruction": "Nils?  He wasn't in the suit.  God, I would never have had sex with Nils.

He said that he felt a moral obligation to try to save them.", "input": "", "output": "Save them from their mother?"}, {"instruction": "Look, Doctor, I don't know what Richard's agenda is.

And Tom loves them too.  What is Richard right about?"}, {"instruction": "It's just that...I don't know, it's a feeling I get every now and then, that's all.

I feel terrified, but I don't know exactly why or what caused it.", "input": "", "output": "When do you get these feelings?"}, {"instruction": "At no particular time.  They just flood over me and I try to shake them off as fast as I can before I drown in them.  I hate feeling so much out of control.", "input": "", "output": "So it's a panicky feeling associated with being out of control?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so.  You have to admit, Doctor, it's not like I have a full grip on what's going on with my life right now.  When I try to cope with my problems, I feel like I'm trying to catch fleas with a plate--as soon as I turn around to get the next flea, the ones on the plate jump away.

I hate fleas!", "input": "", "output": "When did the dream start?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  Maybe around the time when the twins were born.  I remember having the dream when we lived in the hospital's waiting room for that first week.", "input": "", "output": "Let's talk more about being out of control.  Do you feel that it's exclusively related to your current set of problems--the article, SII, Richard's lawsuit, your parents?"}, {"instruction": "I think that that's enough to give nightmares to anyone, don't you?", "input": "", "output": "It's a heavy load.  But most of these problems will resolve themselves with time.  The article will be old news before long.  Richard's lawsuit is annoying but ultimately pointless, and it too will go away in the not too distant future.  Your parents will forgive you.  You said it yourself--they are too attached to the boys to allow their conception to be too much of an issue.  And as your name leaves the public eye, their embarrassment in front of their neighbors will dissipate.  And as for SII...I don't know.  I guess you'll have to make the ultimate decision of whether you want to go back to work there or not.  But if you do decide to go back--even there, after some initial period, things will settle down into a normal routine."}, {"instruction": "You make it all sound so inevitable.", "input": "", "output": "I'm just trying to point out that things are not as bad you think they are.  And with time, most of your problems will resolve themselves."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not saying all your problems will go away by themselves.  Your current situation with Tom will only be resolved through a lot of effort on the part of both of you."}, {"instruction": "That terrifies me the most, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Tom.  I met him when I was very young, still in college.  He became a part of me.  There were times when I didn't know where I stopped and he began.  It's like my consciousness expanded to include him in it.  My thoughts and emotions, even my ultimate desires were completely immersed in him.  When I think of it now, it really scares me, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "It scares you that you don't feel that way about him anymore or..."}, {"instruction": "No, not that.  What scares me is just how dependent I was on Tom, how completely I trusted him.  Tom's influence spread over my whole adult life, pretty much.  He was the one directing my career away from journalism and into the corporate world, for example.", "input": "", "output": "You told me about resenting him for that."}, {"instruction": "At the time, I didn't even question it--Tom suggested doing it and I did it.  Simple as that.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't feel that way now?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want to feel that way ever again, Doctor.  I've lost the ability to experience ultimate love.  And I think Tom knows it.  That's what he wants from me.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "To give into him completely again.  But I don't want to do that again.  When I found out about Tom's vasectomy and how much he betrayed me, I thought my world was going to end.  I felt like there was a giant wound ripped open in my stomach and I was bleeding to death.  You saw me then, Doctor.  You must remember.", "input": "", "output": "I remember."}, {"instruction": "When I found out that I was going to be able to survive, I managed to squirrel away a piece of myself.  I carefully nourished that piece and built protective walls around it.  I vowed never to let anyone possess that piece.  That piece is my security, my assurance of survival through the next crisis.  When Rene's husband died, we all watched in horror as she slowly began to lose her mind.", "input": "", "output": "But she eventually lived through that."}, {"instruction": "Robert saved her.  Robert was part of him, and when he was born, Rene found in him a reason to continue.  Robert saved her.  But it was very close.  It could have easily ended up with Rene losing her...I don't even want to think about that.  You right, she lived through that and now her life is as normal as anyone else's.  But I know that Rene is a much stronger person than I.  I've always known that, even when we were children growing up together.  I won't make it.", "input": "", "output": "But you did make it.  You lived through your loss and came out the other side with two sons and the possibility of a new relationship with Tom."}, {"instruction": "But I could never love him that way again.", "input": "", "output": "You don't have to.  Your love changed.  It evolved.  But it's still love, even though it feels different now.  Don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "I do believe that I love Tom.  But I don't love him enough.", "input": "", "output": "That's..."}, {"instruction": "I could never let him get that close to me again.  I could never love him with all of my being as I did before.  I'm too afraid!", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that Tom is asking you to abandon yourself to him.  I think Tom just wants you to love him the way that you do.  He is not asking you to give up that secret place to him."}, {"instruction": "I think he is.  I think that's why he is hesitating to get close to me.  That's why he won't make love to me.  He knows that I will never be fully his again.", "input": "", "output": "I hate to keep saying it, but time will help.  If you allow yourself to love him as much as you feel you can, with time you might trust Tom enough to get closer to you."}, {"instruction": "With time we might get closer.  But it will never be ultimate love.  I will never experience that kind of love again.  It's terrifying.", "input": "", "output": "When you say it's terrifying, do you mean that type of love is terrifying or that it is terrifying that you won't experience it again?"}, {"instruction": "Both.", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "I think I would like to go now, Doctor.  It's late anyway and, as always, I need to get home and feed the boys.", "input": "", "output": "I would like to talk more about this, Sylvia.  I don't think you..."}, {"instruction": "Sure, Doctor.

How are you doing today?"}, {"instruction": "Not too bad.  I've decided to heed your advice and take back some control over my life.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I just let things happen to me for the longest time instead of grabbing the reins, so to speak.", "input": "", "output": "So what did you do?"}, {"instruction": "You sound worried, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "No...not really worried. You sound very assertive.  Did you have a breakthrough with Tom?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Nothing changed in that department, but give me time.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure that your relationship with Tom will benefit by letting a lot of time pass.  I really encourage you to do something soon."}, {"instruction": "I know you do.  But let me revel in my other accomplishments.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I'll bite.  What other accomplishments?"}, {"instruction": "I finally took action and went down to SII last Friday.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, how was that?"}, {"instruction": "It was a memorable experience.", "input": "", "output": "Would you care to elaborate?"}, {"instruction": "It was a most interesting and informative visit, Doctor.  When I first walked in through the door, there was a gasp when the receptionist recognized me.  You were right. There was an initial reaction resembling shock from the people around.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that was to be expected."}, {"instruction": "Perhaps.  At first this poor woman--the receptionist--pretended not to pay any attention to me.  Then she was looking around to see if anyone else nearby had noticed me.  But I calmly said hello to her and just went past her towards Lloyd's office.  As I made my way through the company, a wave of silence spread before me. People stopped what they were doing and stared.  Behind me, there was a roar of whispering as people started gossiping.", "input": "", "output": "Instantaneous gossip--sounds pretty horrible."}, {"instruction": "It was pretty stressful.", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Hold on, Doctor, it gets a lot more interesting from here.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "When I finally arrived at Lloyd's office, the whole company must have known that I was in.  I swear, people somehow found a reason to be on the executive floor at SII.  I suppose they wanted to be within hearing distance just in case something spectacular happened.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "They didn't know.  But they wanted to be there when it happened.", "input": "", "output": "Did Lloyd knew you were coming?"}, {"instruction": "I'd let him know that I would stop by his office on Friday.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "The door to his reception area was wide open and Lloyd made quite a show of being extraordinarily nice to me.  He also knew that the whole of SII was watching.", "input": "", "output": "So what did you want to talk to Lloyd about?"}, {"instruction": "I wanted to come back to SII.", "input": "", "output": "Right now?  So soon?"}, {"instruction": "No, not right now, but in the near future.  I wanted to discuss with Lloyd a period of transition that I would need. I want to start part time and go back to work on a regular basis starting June.", "input": "", "output": "You mean to work full-time in June?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I need to open up my universe, Doctor.  After being home day after day for months, I'm beginning to lose sight of the whole picture.  I think that's what you were trying to point out to me last time--you said most of my problems would resolve themselves in time?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but..."}, {"instruction": "Well, it's up to me to determine the length of that time period.  If I stay home for a few more months, there would be that much more inertia to overcome.  It's hard enough to do this now.  And I think the added perspective--the dimension that work gives to one's life--would ultimately help with my relationship with Tom.", "input": "", "output": "How do you figure?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  Maybe just being surrounded with people whose relationships are not even comparable in happiness to the one that Tom and I enjoy now would be enough.", "input": "", "output": "That's a bit cynical, isn't it?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe.  But let me continue with my SII field trip.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, please go on."}, {"instruction": "After much fussing--getting me coffee and asking me about the well-being of my boys--Lloyd finally led me into his office.  Then--this'll give you an idea about Lloyd's character--Mr. Major told me that he was thinking of making a play for Apple and asked whether I had any suggestions for him.", "input": "", "output": "Apple?"}, {"instruction": "You know, Apple Computer?  The company that made that Powerbook on your desk?", "input": "", "output": "What does Lloyd want with Apple?"}, {"instruction": "He kept shouting: \"It's in play, it's in play.\"", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "I told Lloyd that I always believed that a buyout by a big computer company was probably best for Apple.  There was that Sun deal for a while, and Ellison's been blowing smoke recently.  I always figured IBM would eventually come out of the woodwork and make a bid--that makes the most sense to me.  But perhaps SII...I don't know.  I'm still trying to digest that one.  I don't know whether Lloyd is brilliant or just plain crazy.  But this should begin to give you a feel for Lloyd.", "input": "", "output": "Indeed it does."}, {"instruction": "I mean SII is big, but to try to digest Apple...that's a company that has about eight times our annual gross.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't know Lloyd was that rich."}, {"instruction": "Oh, he's talking about investment bankers and leveraged buyouts.  He'll end up in debt up to his eyeballs if he succeeds.  But he is enamored of his toys, and this would be his chance to become really famous.  He did say we own a lot of Apples.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that's quite the same thing."}, {"instruction": "No.  But our focus is mainly in the mini and mainframe market. In some ways, it makes sense.  We have nothing for the consumer market--we've always been a high-end, corporate and niche player--like the movie business, Internet routers, high level transactions--you know, brokerage houses and that stuff.  With Apple, we could take our high-end technology and bring it down into the consumer market.  Lloyd has a vision of taking over the world--at least the part that Microsoft doesn't already have dibs on.", "input": "", "output": "Lloyd and Bill...well, if Lloyd is successful, I'll have a whole lot more patients, I imagine."}, {"instruction": "Those poor Apple guys have been pushed up one side and down the other.  I bet they'd be flocking here in droves.  You'd have to start hiring associates to satisfy the demand.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not speaking professionally of course, but it sounds like Lloyd is a megalomaniac."}, {"instruction": "You have no idea.  But I'll tell you more about Lloyd a bit later.", "input": "", "output": "There's more?"}, {"instruction": "When it comes to Lloyd, there's always more.  So after Lloyd speculated about his prospects for buying Apple, I was finally given a chance to tell him about my plan to go back to work.", "input": "", "output": "And?  What did he think?"}, {"instruction": "He was actually quite positive, although he did say that I would be the most controversial VP in his organization.  But he told me not to worry and that he'd find a way to make use of that.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  What about Nils?"}, {"instruction": "Lloyd said that Nils was not a problem and that he'd take care of him.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I did stop by my department that same day.", "input": "", "output": "How was the homecoming?"}, {"instruction": "Everyone seemed happy to see me.  I got to show pictures of Grant and Roald to everybody.  Overall, it felt like a warm reception.", "input": "", "output": "And Nils?"}, {"instruction": "He was very charming--made nice comments about my boys and was sugar sweet in every way.  Later, though, he asked me to come into my office--his office--so that we could have a chat.", "input": "", "output": "I suppose he knew what your visit meant."}, {"instruction": "Indeed.  He told me that he was very happy to see that I was well enough to come back, even if on a part-time basis.", "input": "", "output": "But that's only for a month."}, {"instruction": "His last month in my office.", "input": "", "output": "So he wasn't bitter?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't say that.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "Nils told me that as great admirer of my work--my writing, I suppose-- and as a friend, he felt compelled to tell me about a few unpleasant matters that happened in my absence.", "input": "", "output": "Would that be the SII witch hunt that he conducted trying to smear your character?"}, {"instruction": "Very perceptive, Doctor.  Nils' story--and he is sticking to it--is that the so-called witch hunt was conducted on the express orders of none other than Mr. Major.", "input": "", "output": "Lloyd?"}, {"instruction": "One and the same.  Nils said that he was very concerned that Mr. Major was trying to conduct his investigation into my character on behalf of...now, Doctor, you should be able to guess this one.", "input": "", "output": "The only one that I can think of who could have benefited from the investigation would be Nils himself.  He would have gotten your job.  Who else would have had it out for you?"}, {"instruction": "You're forgetting someone.  Who is it that really wanted to compile every possible fact about who I was sleeping with and when?", "input": "", "output": "You mean Richard?  For his lawsuit?  But how?  Why would Lloyd assist him like that? I still think it was really Nils' idea.  That's what makes the most sense."}, {"instruction": "That's what I thought too.  And I still think that, by the way.  Remember the phone call I made to Nils pretending to be a reporter from Wired?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "He was clearly after my job.  But what Nils revealed Friday was that he was ordered to do the investigation by Lloyd.  That's how he had such free access to all my personal files and how he could reach outside of my department--that's how he learned about the security breach.  Nils said that Lloyd was encouraging him through the whole thing.", "input": "", "output": "But why?  Lloyd clearly wants you back.  Why would he be interested in helping Richard get custody of your boys?"}, {"instruction": "Richard used to be Lloyd's lover.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "I was surprised too...I mean, I've been with the guy.  I'd never have imagined that he swings both ways.  And him and Lloyd...but it does make sense.", "input": "", "output": "So the fist fight between Richard and Nils..."}, {"instruction": "Jealousy.  When Nils found out that he had been used by Richard, he blew up.  Nils still considers himself to be Lloyd's boyfriend.

I'm telling you my version of the story, of course.  Nils was trying to ingratiate himself with me.  He kept telling me how he was an unwilling pawn in this whole thing and how sorry he was to be inadvertently responsible for anything in Richard's custody suit, or its publicity.  Yada yada yada.", "input": "", "output": "I got it."}, {"instruction": "So at least, now I know.", "input": "", "output": "You lead a complicated life, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "It's late.  Thank you for listening, Doctor.  You're the only one who really knows the whole story at this point.", "input": "", "output": "Well, keep me posted.  And Tom strikes me as being a good strategic thinker.  Why don't you make him your confidant?  Maybe you can achieve a greater intimacy thinking up vile revenge plots against Richard, Lloyd, and Nils."}, {"instruction": "It's an interesting idea.  At least I'll have something to talk to him about other than breast pumping and diaper rash.  I'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, next Tuesday at four.  See you then."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.  I'm very happy to see you.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you.  I'm happy to see you too, Sylvia.  How are you?"}, {"instruction": "There are days and there are days.  I officially started to work part-time.  Last Friday was my first day back in the office.", "input": "", "output": "How's it going?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, it's rough.  Nils was so busy, first trying to smear my name through the mud to maneuver himself into a permanent position as the head of my department, and now manipulating corporate politics...the upshot is that nothing was really done there in the last six months.  It's a total mess.  No one really knows what projects they are assigned to.  Everything is on the \"this needs to get out now\" basis--there is no planning and scheduling of projects ahead of time.  I'm sorry, Doctor, I'm just venting.  I don't really get to do that at home.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Tom didn't think that going back to SII so early was a good idea.  He'd rather I spent my time with Grant and Roald.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk to Tom about why you thought it would be important for you to go back to work?"}, {"instruction": "He said that that's what you're for.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "I used \"emotional stability\" and \"having an outside perspective on my life\" as arguments for returning to work.  But Tom thought that that's what I see you for.  He didn't really mean it.  I know where he's coming from--when I see the boys--they are still so little--my chest tightens and I get these unbelievable feelings of love and protectiveness flooding over me. I've watched Tom's face when he's with Grant and Roald, I know he feels this too.  When I'm with the boys, I don't want to leave their sight.  It's when I'm alone that I realize that taking care of them is just not enough.

He just wishes that I waited a bit more.  My mother, on the other hand, does not understand at all.  She thinks I'm a bad mother for abandoning \"her little darlings.\"", "input": "", "output": "How is your mom's health these days?"}, {"instruction": "She's still very frail.  She quit working in the restaurant all together.  In fact, she pretty much moved in to our house.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "She said that the boys need her now that their mother left them.  They fill her days, and I think it's making her stronger.  I mean, she's not really taking care of them on the need-by-need basis--we have a wonderful series of nannies who do that--but she lavishes them with attention and love and they all benefit from that.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a very good arrangement."}, {"instruction": "Yes, it really is.  My mother grumbles a lot about needing to spend all her time with the boys because their mother won't, but deep down she is thrilled at the opportunity to get so involved with them.", "input": "", "output": "How does Tom feel about your mother being at your house all the time?"}, {"instruction": "He's happy about.  He can see it's good for all three of them.  And our house is large enough that her presence doesn't interfere with his privacy when he needs it.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "And Tom always had a good relationship with my parents, at times better then I had--they took his side when the divorce papers were first filed.", "input": "", "output": "I never asked, is that completely off now?"}, {"instruction": "The divorce?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  I realize that you're no longer interested in going through with it right now.  But..."}, {"instruction": "We're officially back together.  The only legal issue that's hanging over us is the child custody lawsuit from Richard.", "input": "", "output": "How is Richard?  Do you get to see him now that you're back at SII?"}, {"instruction": "I haven't run into him yet, but I'm sure I will have that pleasure eventually.  Oh, you'll love this, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Nils got a restraining order against Richard.", "input": "", "output": "What?!"}, {"instruction": "Remember Richard broke Nils' nose in that infamous office fight?  As far as I know, Nils didn't file any charges, but he's using the incident to advance his position at SII.  He's capitalizing on the fact that Lloyd doesn't want the whole world to know about what his relationship with Richard might have been.", "input": "", "output": "Nils is blackmailing Lloyd?"}, {"instruction": "That's my theory.  I have to say that it did get very messy and Lloyd should have known better than to get Nils involved.  If Lloyd wanted to do Richard a favor, he should have found other means than using his current boyfriend to do the leg-work for him.  Now, Nils is busy drawing up elaborate maps and floor plans of SII building and dividing it into regions that are safe for Richard to be in without violating the restraining order--coming within 200 yards of Nils.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds insane.  How is Nils handling the lobby, for example?  Does Richard have to use the back entrance now?"}, {"instruction": "There's some sort of time partitioning that is involved in Nils' restraining order proposal.  And he reassigned his own office to meet the necessary criteria.", "input": "", "output": "I bet it's bigger and better than his old one."}, {"instruction": "Oh hell, if Nils thought that he could get Lloyd to move out of his, I'm sure he would...he's such a jerk.  Do you see what I mean about not getting any actual work done?  He's just too busy playing the corporate game.", "input": "", "output": "And more.  Usually, playing the corporate game means trying to ingratiate yourself or put down someone else.  Nils seems like he's got a giant board, and dice, and little markers."}, {"instruction": "That's about it.  I spent all day Friday in meetings.  And yesterday was no better.  I can see how this part-time thing could turn into 60 hour weeks in no time.", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you want?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'll try to be very careful not to let that happen.  And my own body will surely remind me if I'm overdoing it.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure I know what you mean by that?  Are you feeling tired?"}, {"instruction": "No.  My mind might forget sometimes that I'm a mother, but my body doesn't.  Yesterday, we were all in a conference room talking about the CD-Rom and web site materials that we'll have to generate for the next product release in June. The door was open and someone was playing a radio in a nearby office.  I didn't even realize that you could hear it.  Suddenly, my breasts tightened and swelled and the person next to me was asking if I was feeling well--my blouse was completely soaked with milk.  There was a commercial on the radio with a baby crying and before I even registered that sound, my breasts exploded with milk.  I was completely wet.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds very unpleasant."}, {"instruction": "It was very embarrassing.  Most of my staff is fairly young and very few are married and have children.  My body's reaction to the radio commercial was completely alien to them.  In fact, that's a completely normal response of a breast-feeding mother to the sound of a crying child--produce milk, lots of it, and feed the baby!  It's completely instinctual.  But  at the meeting, I had to call it a day and leave for home in a hurry.  My staff just took it as more proof of my strangeness--or insanity, depending on how kind they were.", "input": "", "output": "Motherhood in the corporate world has its difficulties."}, {"instruction": "You know, just by talking about breast-feeding and milk, I feel my breast begin to ache and move into the production mode.

You do look substantially bigger than when you came in today."}, {"instruction": "Oh Doctor, I change two bra sizes between the feedings.  It's amazing.

Take care, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.  How are you?", "input": "", "output": "I'm very well. Thank you, Sylvia.

How are the boys?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I'm realizing that it's a lot harder than I imagined.", "input": "", "output": "You mean working and being a mom?"}, {"instruction": "Our social structure is just not set up to support parents.  Grant wasn't feeling well last week.  He caught a cold.  And while it wasn't a major life emergency, I still felt that it was more important that I was by his side than attending Lloyd's VP meeting on his corporate take-over of Apple.", "input": "", "output": "But Mr. Major didn't see it that way, I presume."}, {"instruction": "No.  He is obsessed with his stupid plan to assimilate Apple into his empire.  So instead of working less hours, I ended up working almost the full forty last week and then going home and staying up with Grant all night.  I don't know how other people do it.", "input": "", "output": "Work and have children?"}, {"instruction": "I have all the help in the world available to me--nannies twenty-four hours a day, my mother dedicated to helping me out every way she can, a supportive husband ready to be there if I can't make it.  I've got a house, and money, and servants. How does a woman living from paycheck to paycheck manage to have a family?  Day-care centers won't take a sick child.  At least they try not to.  What is a woman with a sick baby supposed to do if she can't afford to stay home from work?  I'm lucky, but it's fairly uncommon nowadays to live in the same town as your parents.  You can't call your Mom to come and be an emergency babysitter for you if she lives on the other side of the continent. I'm surprised that there aren't more mothers than there already are on welfare, given our current society.  There really aren't many other options.", "input": "", "output": "When you talk with that kind of passion, I can see how it must have been when you were a journalist.  I can almost see the feature story on family reform brewing."}, {"instruction": "Now, I'd rather spend all my available time with my boys, than invest it into the article calling for more social supports for mothers and children.  That's scary.  It's not how I'd have felt just a year ago.", "input": "", "output": "It's not selfish to want to be with your family, especially when they need you so much.  There are others who can write that article."}, {"instruction": "You're making it sound really bad.  Now I feel guilty for...", "input": "", "output": "For not trying to change the system?  Relax, Sylvia.  Concentrate on your family.  There's time enough to change the world.  How is your relationship with Tom progressing?"}, {"instruction": "I think I feel less intimidated by him now.", "input": "", "output": "Why were you feeling intimidated by Tom?"}, {"instruction": "I was watching him being a great Dad, working to save his family from coming apart.  And he still managed his own workload somehow.  I was all wrapped-up in my feelings and emotions and sort of lost touch with reality.  Going back to work really makes an amazing difference.  It gives perspective to life that I can't see when I'm just at home.  I guess work is really critical to me.  People who choose not to work must suffer from chronic psychological ailments--they have too much time on their hands, so they must analyze and examine their lives in minute detail. All they would notice would be the little rough spots and imperfections in their lives.  If you work, there's no time for that.  You just hang on and ride it out, hoping that the big problems won't throw you.  The little things are just background noise.", "input": "", "output": "It's an interesting theory, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "I think my relationship with Tom is improving.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Do you want to talk about that?"}, {"instruction": "Ironically, now that I'm not home as much, we seem to talk to each other more.  Before, when I was home all day, Tom was around for all the action in my days.  He was part of it.  So all our conversations were about things we had experienced together; they tended to be just our feelings and opinions about those events.  Or worse, we'd have conversations about the progress of our relationship.  I hated those conversations.  I dreaded them.  Now, I'm in the office all day.  I have a world outside my home and family.  And that gives me something to talk about with Tom.  I mean, I still talk about my feelings--mostly about how angry I am with Lloyd or Nils. But that's all outside the scope of our daily lives together and contains real news--something that Tom didn't have a chance to see and experience for himself.  Now when I settle in to feed the boys at night, Tom stays in the room and I tell him about all the stupidity at SII, and he tells me about his day.  He's been working with a few technology companies that were started up by ex-Apple employees--\"out of the ashes of...\"  He thinks that Lloyd's takeover dreams are comical but still expressive of the current state of affairs at Apple.", "input": "", "output": "So now that you're back in play, so to speak, you and Tom have more to talk about."}, {"instruction": "Exactly.  He also seems less stressed about the whole SII lovers thing.  I think that's because everything is so out in the open now and he knows the degree of scrutiny I have to face each day at SII.  Tom's more relaxed about it.  It seems clear to him that I have very little interest in pursuing any of those relationships.", "input": "", "output": "Have you had sexual relations with Tom yet?"}, {"instruction": "No.  He still goes to sleep in the other bedroom.  I tried raising the issue a couple of times, but he cut me off.  But now that I know that our relationship is improving overall, I'm more confidant about waiting for him to come around.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.   Did you ever actually tell Tom that you loved him?"}, {"instruction": "I think so.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds like you didn't really."}, {"instruction": "I told you how I felt about it.  My feelings for Tom have changed.  I'm still in love with him, but it's different now.  In some ways, if I just came right out and told Tom that I love him, it would be a lie and he'd know it.", "input": "", "output": "I think you're making a mistake, Sylvia, by not letting Tom know how you feel.  If Tom believes that you are staying with him because it's convenient and not because of the love you feel for him, he won't let go of his barriers either.  It's difficult enough to spend a lifetime with a person without the need to constantly guard and hold back your feelings."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I will never let go of myself so completely again.  Neither you nor Tom can make me.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not encouraging you to abandon yourself to your relationship with Tom.  I'm just encouraging you to let him know how you feel.  It would help a lot if Tom knew that you're in this for the long haul."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to talk about this more now, Doctor.  Let's move on.", "input": "", "output": "As you wish.  So the weather has been nice lately, don't you think?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor!  I didn't mean...", "input": "", "output": "You're trying to avoid dealing with difficult subjects.  Fine.  How is the weather?"}, {"instruction": "Let go, Doctor.  I'm just too tired to talk more about my feelings for Tom.  I get anxious just thinking about it.  I'll need to drive for at least a half hour around the city before I go home tonight as it is.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "It helps me clear my head.  But I'm not trying to skip out on discussing difficult issues with you.  Really.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "I'm a good patient, really I am.", "input": "", "output": "Then let's go back to work, Ms. Doolittle."}, {"instruction": "Yes, Professor Higgins.  Bruce Redot called for me last week.", "input": "", "output": "Bruce...forgive me, Sylvia, there were so many.  Which one was Bruce?"}, {"instruction": "He was the sculptor.", "input": "", "output": "Oh yes, now I remember.  He has a villa in Marin and was occasionally employed by SII to prototype casing designs for new hardware."}, {"instruction": "That's the one.  You do have good memory, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you.  So Bruce called?"}, {"instruction": "He got Tom on the phone.  Apparently, they had a very good conversation.  Tom told Bruce about the twins and just how happy we were with them.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "And Bruce was bright enough to realize that Tom and I are back together.  Bruce has been away living in Milan for the last eight months.  He didn't know about the pregnancy or anything else for that matter.", "input": "", "output": "Was he named in Richard's lawsuit?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Richard was only able to gather information about people who were currently employed by SII.  He knew that there were others.  But he never knew their names and was not clear on the dates--there was just so much I was volunteering even during pillow talk.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So Tom didn't know..."}, {"instruction": "That Bruce and I...no.  He had a very pleasant conversation with him and was even invited to dinner, subject to my approval.", "input": "", "output": "Are you going?"}, {"instruction": "Bruce said that he would be extremely disappointed if we declined his invitation.  Tom and I haven't really gone out since our trip to Sonoma with the boys.", "input": "", "output": "That's when you learned about the article?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it wasn't the best situation.  And since then, a lot of Tom's friends and our mutual friends have been finding us too controversial to socialize with us or to be seen in public together.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Sylvia.  I didn't realize..."}, {"instruction": "If that's the price I have to pay for Grant and Roald, then so be it.  But Bruce's dinner invitation was...it seems to me that Tom wants to go.  And I feel strange turning it down.  Tom may question that.", "input": "", "output": "So Tom, Bruce, and you are having dinner together?"}, {"instruction": "This coming Saturday.  Fun, isn't it?", "input": "", "output": "Sounds very awkward.  Did you have a chance to speak to Bruce yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Briefly.  I brought him up to date on my current situation.  He said that he was disappointed, but was happy for me and was looking forward to seeing Tom--\"the lucky bastard\"--and me.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Bruce is a good guy.  I doubt he'd do anything to jeopardize my relationship with Tom.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that."}, {"instruction": "It's getting late, Doctor.  I'll see you next week.  Please don't be angry with me for trying to avoid some issues in my life.  I have a lot on my plate right now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not angry with you, Sylvia.  I want to help you work things out with Tom.  I believe you'll be very happy if you do."}, {"instruction": "You're right, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Sylvia.  Please sit down."}, {"instruction": "Oh yeah.  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "What's going on?"}, {"instruction": "Well, a lot has happened last week, Doctor.  Some things are very good, but others...life can be very unjust sometimes.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Where do you want me to start?  Good or bad, Doctor, your choice.", "input": "", "output": "Let's start with the bad and leave the good for the end of the session--we'll end on the lighter note."}, {"instruction": "Actually, I don't think I can really separate the two.", "input": "", "output": "Just go ahead, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "We arrived at Bruce's at around seven-thirty last Saturday.  I think I told you, he has a beautiful house with a spectacular 360 degree view of San Francisco and the Bay Area.  Bruce leads a very decadent life style.  He doesn't believe in denying himself anything.  The house is built to be super comfortable.  He has a home theater complete with Egyptian decor and an old fashioned popcorn machine.  The whole house is decorated in a mixture of super modern electronics mixed with antiques from all over the world.  Bruce collects everything and his house is filled with strange and wonderful stuff.  I would love to take my boys there someday when they are older--they'd have the time of their lives going through all those marvelous things.  And Bruce gets a kick out of showing off his collections.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a very fun place."}, {"instruction": "It really is.  Saturday was extremely hot, if you remember.", "input": "", "output": "It was the hottest day since I've moved to the area."}, {"instruction": "Well, it was even warmer in Marin.  Bruce had our dinner served out on the terrace.  We watched the sun set and drank our cocktails outside.  Things were going very well.  I even relaxed somewhat and stopped worrying about Tom and Bruce being in such close proximity to each other.  And they were getting along very well.  Tom was telling Bruce about my recent adventures at SII--about Lloyd's strangeness and all that, not about the lovers...", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "It turns out that Bruce knew Lloyd when he was Lenny Majedenski--a hard-working Hungarian-American student getting his biochemistry degree from Cal Tech.", "input": "", "output": "Lenny Majedenski?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently, Lloyd is a complete Anglophile.  And, Bruce said, Lloyd believed that \"Lloyd Major\" is a better name for a CEO than Lenny Majedenski.  Well, I'm not surprised, Doctor.  Are you?", "input": "", "output": "No, I guess not.  How does Bruce know Lloyd?"}, {"instruction": "Bruce was considering going to Cal Tech and was there on tour.  His tour guide was none other than Mr. Majedenski himself.", "input": "", "output": "Somehow I can't imagine Lloyd as a tour guide."}, {"instruction": "Bruce said that he wasn't any good, but he did throw a good party afterwards.", "input": "", "output": "So Lloyd and Bruce are friends?"}, {"instruction": "I guess on some level.  That's why Bruce was doing work for SII.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "The world is a very small place, Doctor.  Our lives prove this over and over again.", "input": "", "output": "True.  So what happened that night with Tom, Bruce, and you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, as I was saying, we were all having a delightful time.  Bruce's sushi chef was an artist and his creations weren't just unbelievably delicious, but they were really miniature food sculptures.", "input": "", "output": "A sushi chef?"}, {"instruction": "It was hot.  Sushi was a perfect dinner selection.  But as we were laughing at Bruce's stories about Lloyd's party style, Bruce suddenly collapsed right onto the deck.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "It was horrible.  He hit the tiles so hard his face was a puddle of blood.  And then his whole body was shaking and trembling and he was rolling around and thrashing on the ground.", "input": "", "output": "Bruce had a grand mal seizure?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, and it lasted for such a long time that we thought it would be best call 911.  Tom and I tried keep him from getting hurt more than he was all ready.  When the paramedics got there, Bruce was just beginning to gain consciousness.  He was very groggy and out of it as they cleaned him up and put some bandages on his face.  He didn't break his nose, as we feared, but he was still pretty bruised from his fall.  The paramedics decided on take Bruce to the emergency room even though he said that he was suffering from epilepsy and it was really a waste of time and he knew what to do himself.  They insisted, and Bruce made a very polite apology to us and asked us to stay in his house. He really made it clear that he wanted us to finish our dinner, and enjoy the facilities while he was out.", "input": "", "output": "That was very nice of Bruce."}, {"instruction": "He was almost embarrassed by the incident.  But everything he was telling me to make me feel better only made me more freaked out.", "input": "", "output": "I don't understand.  You were worried about Bruce's health?"}, {"instruction": "He said that epilepsy runs in his family and that this happens all the time--I shouldn't worry about it, he knows what to do and how to cope.", "input": "", "output": "I..."}, {"instruction": "Epilepsy runs in his family, Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "You mean..."}, {"instruction": "It's possible that Bruce is the father of Grant or Roald or both.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "I think I was in shock.  I checked so carefully--went through all the medical records of all the men I had sex with.  I wanted to avoid just such a possibility.  And yet...", "input": "", "output": "Bruce's medical file didn't have reference to hereditary epilepsy?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing of the sort.  It said that Bruce was in perfect health.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Did you tell Tom?"}, {"instruction": "I was so terrified of what I just learned.  It's like my whole life just suddenly changed.  All I could think about is if there were any resemblances--physical or in mannerisms--between my boys and Bruce.", "input": "", "output": "The boys are just two months old--it would be impossible to tell just yet."}, {"instruction": "I know.  All I can do now is wait.", "input": "", "output": "The chances that Grant or Roald are Bruce's children..."}, {"instruction": "It doesn't matter how high or low that risk is.  It's there and it's awful.  If Bruce stood just a bit closer to the rail, he could have fallen three stories down to the rocks below.  I don't want to live to bury my children, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, you're blowing this way out of proportion.  First of all, Bruce might not be the father of either of your boys.  And second, even if he is, epilepsy is mostly controllable through anti-seizure medications.  Most people with this condition can effectively reduce the number of seizures and their intensity."}, {"instruction": "Bruce couldn't.", "input": "", "output": "You don't know what Bruce's situation is.  He might not be taking his medication, for instance."}, {"instruction": "If he doesn't, he probably has a damn good reason for it--like it makes him sick or dulls his senses.", "input": "", "output": "You don't know that."}, {"instruction": "After the paramedics took him away and the maid cleaned the blood off the deck, Tom and I were left alone.  We weren't interested in any more food and I was so completely shaken by what just happened that Tom thought it would be good idea to get me a drink and sit me down for a bit.  He was so caring.  He took me in his arms and let me cry.  I felt guilty, because I knew that he believed that I was just upset by watching my friend get so sick.  He didn't...", "input": "", "output": "You didn't tell Tom about Bruce and you..."}, {"instruction": "I couldn't then.  My whole body was as cold and heavy and as immobile as a block of ice.  It was hot, but I was frozen.  Tom let everyone go home.  We were left alone to wait for Bruce to return home.", "input": "", "output": "You wanted to wait for Bruce?"}, {"instruction": "He really wanted us to, I think.  We went to the garden deck--it was away from where Bruce...", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "There was a swimming pool and a hot tub laid out among the roses.  Tom took off my shoes and lifted my skirt, and then sat me at the edge of the tub and put my feet in the water to warm them up.  He was so gentle and...more than gentle.  He was trying to make me comfortable and yet was allowing me to feel what I was feeling.  He wasn't really talking to me, just sitting very close and gently whispering my name over and over again.  It was hypnotic and after a while my mind seemed to clear of all thought except for my immediate surroundings.  Somehow our lips met and I found myself drinking in his every breath and tasting his lips...I've forgotten just how good that was.  And he wasn't pushing me away.  He was just as eager to be with me as I was with him.  It was incredibly intense lying there on the grass under the stars amid all those flowers.  It was as if my whole body suddenly came to life.  I wanted no bit of my flesh left untouched--I wanted all of him, and he wanted all of me.  We must have been out there for hours, making love over and over again.", "input": "", "output": "And Bruce?"}, {"instruction": "He didn't get back until early the next morning.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Well, congratulations, Sylvia.  I think you might have made a major improvement in your relationship with Tom."}, {"instruction": "I don't understand how we could have waited so long to make love.  The incredible feeling of closeness that people get through physical contact is a very critical component of human interactions and relationships.  You don't realize just how critical until you experience the lack of it.", "input": "", "output": "Are you continuing your sexual relations with Tom?"}, {"instruction": "We have a lot of time to catch up on, Doctor.  I feel like I did when Tom and I first met.  There is this extraordinary anticipation--I can hardly concentrate on what I'm doing at work.  And then when we meet...", "input": "", "output": "I think I get the idea."}, {"instruction": "Oh I'm sorry, Doctor.  I didn't mean to embarrass you.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't.  But our time is up."}, {"instruction": "That was fast.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week?"}, {"instruction": "Of course.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  And try to put your fears regarding epilepsy in perspective.  It's highly unlikely..."}, {"instruction": "I'll try to figure out just how unlikely.", "input": "", "output": "What are you planning to do, Sylvia?"}, {"instruction": "I'll talk to Bruce.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry, Doctor.  I think Bruce will understand and will try to help.", "input": "", "output": "I hope so."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you next week, Doctor.

No one.  I don't think I will.", "input": "", "output": "What happened?  Did you talk with Bruce?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I did.", "input": "", "output": "How did it go?"}, {"instruction": "It went unexpectedly.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Do you want to talk about it?"}, {"instruction": "Yes I do.  But I'm still trying to digest it all.  So let's see. I tried contacting Bruce for several days after our last session.  But apparently, after a seizure, it takes him a few days to fully recover.  He didn't get back to me until last weekend.", "input": "", "output": "It's fairly common to have a recovery period of several days after..."}, {"instruction": "Oh I understand, Doctor.  I wasn't questioning that at all.  What I needed to find out from Bruce was his family history.  I wanted to know what the chances were that my boys could have inherited his genetic predisposition to epilepsy...", "input": "", "output": "You know, Sylvia, a lot of great men throughout history had epilepsy.  This..."}, {"instruction": "It's not an issue, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What?  I thought that..."}, {"instruction": "Bruce had a vasectomy when he was eighteen years old--as soon as he was old enough to carry out his decision.  His mother's family had a very strong tendency toward this disease.  He watched an uncle die in a car accident--he went out of control during a seizure.  In fact, most of his relatives on his mother's side didn't live past fifty.  Bruce was diagnosed with epilepsy when he was still a child.  By the time he was eighteen, he had read all that there was to read on this subject and had made a decision not to pass on his defective genes to the next generation.", "input": "", "output": "That's very noble."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But I also understand the desire not to see your children suffer like that.  Bruce said that if he ever wanted to have children, he was going to adopt.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's great news, Sylvia.  Now that's one less thing for you to worry about."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I was relieved beyond...it was like a giant weight was lifted off my soul.", "input": "", "output": "That's great, Sylvia.  Out of curiosity, how did Bruce react to you posing that question to him?  I'm sure he must have been surprised by..."}, {"instruction": "Bruce knew all about it.", "input": "", "output": "You told him before?  I thought he didn't read the article or know..."}, {"instruction": "When I finally got to talk to him on Sunday, he knew right away why I was calling.", "input": "", "output": "But..."}, {"instruction": "Tom told him.", "input": "", "output": "Tom?"}, {"instruction": "Tom always surprises me with his insight and his ability to see through the confusion of the events to their very core.  The night we had dinner with Bruce, Tom realized that my reaction to his seizure was way out of proportion.  He knows that's not the way I would react. I'm usually the one who deals in a crisis situation.  I don't fall apart like I did that night.  So Tom figured there was more between Bruce and I than just friendship.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Tom said that he wasn't sure that night.  But after we got home, the way I looked at the kids convinced him that I thought there was a possibility that Bruce was their father.", "input": "", "output": "So while Tom was making love to you that night, he believed that Bruce was one of your lovers?"}, {"instruction": "He is a remarkable man.  I feel even more guilty now about not telling him about Bruce right away.  But to go with my story, Tom also tried contacting Bruce and got hold of him before I did.  Bruce said that Tom was a gentleman on the phone.  He didn't accuse Bruce of fucking me, which is what you'd think he would do.  Instead, Tom apologized for the frankness of his question and explained that he needed to know if his sons were in danger of inheriting Bruce's genetics.  Bruce was shocked by Tom, but told him that there was no chance that the boys were his--he told Tom about his vasectomy.", "input": "", "output": "I'm very surprised by Tom."}, {"instruction": "Me too.  I think any other man in his situation would have turned this whole incident into a nightmare--a husband discovers that the man he's having dinner with is his wife's lover and the possible father of his children and, on top of it all, has hereditary epilepsy.  What a mess!  But Tom's reaction...he was so close to me the night we made love in Bruce's rose garden.  It felt like our souls had merged.  And yet, at the same time that I was horrified about the kids and feeling guilty about my affair, Tom must have been experiencing all that pain and horror as well.", "input": "", "output": "You've talked with Tom since your conversation with Bruce?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I felt like an emotional volcano that exploded with hundreds of years of built-up energy.  After we talked, we made love.  I've never felt such intensity of passion before.  He broke through all my defenses and reached my inner core.  I don't think I've ever loved him more than at that moment.", "input": "", "output": "So you no longer feel that your love for Tom is somehow inferior to the love you felt when you first got married?"}, {"instruction": "No.  It is probably even more powerful than before.", "input": "", "output": "Does that frighten you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But I intend never to be without him again.  There is nothing more important to me than to share my life with his forever.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad.  I think you'll be very happy together."}, {"instruction": "I know we will be, Doctor.  Tom is a great man.  He's even managed to retain Bruce's friendship and maybe even more than that. I think Bruce and Tom are going to be close friends from now on.", "input": "", "output": "But I thought that Bruce sort of resents Tom for being...I thought Bruce believed that if Tom wasn't around, you and he..."}, {"instruction": "Bruce was so impressed by Tom's compassion, insight, understanding, and love that he is completely smitten by him.  Bruce told me that he thought that a man would be lucky to have Tom as a friend.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about it?"}, {"instruction": "Um...it's strange.  Strange and awkward for me, that is.  But I'm sure I'll get over it.  I think a friendship between Bruce and Tom could be a very good thing for both of them.  Bruce the artist and Tom the businessman...I think I'm responsible for Tom losing a lot of his friends.  If Tom and Bruce end up being close, I would be very happy.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "You know, Doctor, one would think that after my experience with Tom, I'd be very aware of vasectomy scars.  Isn't it ironic that two men that I wanted to father my children had that operation and I was completely oblivious to it.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think you were concentrating on that at the time."}, {"instruction": "No.  That was the farthest thing from my mind...in each case.  Maybe the common bond of having vasectomies made Tom and Bruce more empathetic to each other.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm...I don't think so."}, {"instruction": "Maybe not.  In any case, Doctor.  I'm going to leave early today.   Tom and I have a date.", "input": "", "output": "No problem, Sylvia.  I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.  Good night.", "input": "", "output": "Have a good time, Sylvia.  I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.  How are feeling?", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Sylvia.  I'm much better, thank you."}, {"instruction": "When I got the message that you had to cancel due to illness, I thought...well, I knew you must have been very sick.", "input": "", "output": "I had a cold that turned into a bad sinus infection.  I don't want to bore you with the details other than to say that I had a very unpleasant week.  I was really glad to be in the medical field.  Frankly, I don't know how people survive hospitals without having some sort of medical training."}, {"instruction": "I always believed that hospitals were not a place for sick people.  Although, they did save my children and I'm extremely grateful for that.", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  And they also made you live in the lobby for a week with one newborn infant by your side and the other in the ICU."}, {"instruction": "That was charming.  But I didn't realize that you were actually in the hospital, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't responding well to the antibiotics and they needed to go in and remove some...don't worry, Sylvia.  I'm fine, really."}, {"instruction": "You look tired.", "input": "", "output": "It will take me some time to fully recover, but the worst is over and now I'm mostly suffering from low energy.  Please, don't be concerned."}, {"instruction": "I've come to regard you as a personal friend, Doctor, and not just as a therapist.  I can't help but be concerned.  If there is something I can do for you...", "input": "", "output": "You can.  I'd like to feel like I'm able to do my job again.  So please, I would like to start."}, {"instruction": "Of course.  But let me know if you're getting too tired to continue.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "I promise, Sylvia.  So how was your last two weeks?"}, {"instruction": "Are you sure you're well enough to do this?", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia!  I like being a doctor, so please let me."}, {"instruction": "You're asking for it.  The last few weeks...actually last week I even thought that perhaps I should cut down on the number of sessions we have together.  Please don't misunderstand, Doctor.  I find your advice, support, and wisdom extremely valuable and important.  But I feel like I need at least fifty more hours a week just to accomplish the minimum that I need to do.", "input": "", "output": "I understand, Sylvia.  And actually this is our forty-second session together and during that time we did managed to resolve together all the issues that you wanted to deal with when you first came to see me last summer.  I've..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I felt that way last Tuesday.  Last Wednesday, my life changed once again and I would appreciate us continuing our sessions together for at least the near future.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Sylvia, what happened now?"}, {"instruction": "Tom's sister came out to visit us for a week.  She arrived last Saturday.  I never had a particularly close relationship with Beverly, but I was glad she came.  She was very good with the boys and I thought she'd enjoy the role of doting aunt.  I think I told you that Beverly lost her child due to a miscarriage and...it was very bad.", "input": "", "output": "You told me.  Beverly had a very bad pregnancy which ended with the loss of a child, followed by a divorce, the loss of her job, and..."}, {"instruction": "A mental breakdown.  You do remember.", "input": "", "output": "You told me that Tom tried to use her story against you as a means of convincing your parents that his vasectomy was the right thing to do to protect you."}, {"instruction": "That was then, Doctor.  I would rather not bring that up again.", "input": "", "output": "Of course, please forgive me."}, {"instruction": "That's all right.  Tom and I did a lot of things that I would rather never bring up again.  That's all in the past and we have our present and future to concentrate on.", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  So what happened between you and Tom's sister last week?"}, {"instruction": "It's not so much what happened between us.  She was very pleasant when she arrived.  As far as I could tell, she was happy to see us and she adored the boys.  She even insisted that Grant looked like Tom.  I tried telling her that it wasn't really possible, but she said that she didn't care about all that and, as far as she could see, Grant looked like the spitting image of Tom.  I just let it go.", "input": "", "output": "She knew about Tom's vasectomy, right?"}, {"instruction": "I'm sure everyone knows--everyone who reads the papers.  In fact, I think I was around when he told her and his parents.  But she insisted on that point, so...I mean, it really didn't matter to me all that much.  I was happy that she found them beautiful and charming and smart, even though I realize that those qualities are difficult to discern in three month old babies.", "input": "", "output": "She was trying to be nice."}, {"instruction": "That's what I thought.  We--Tom and I--had plans to take Beverly out for dinner on Sunday and to spend a nice evening out on the town.", "input": "", "output": "You were being good hosts?"}, {"instruction": "We were trying to be.  I knew that I would have to work a lot the next week--there was a Board of Directors meeting about the Apple deal--and Tom was putting in long hours even thought he was working primarily out of the house.  So our big chance to take Beverly out was Sunday.  But she refused.", "input": "", "output": "Refused to go out to dinner?"}, {"instruction": "She said that she didn't have many opportunities to spend time with babies and she didn't want to engage in activities that excluded Grant and Roald.", "input": "", "output": "And of course you were planning to leave them at home."}, {"instruction": "They're wonderful boys, but it would have been a mistake to take them to La Folie.", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "But Beverly refused to go.  Finally, we had to order dinner in and spent the evening at home.  It was nice but a bit strange.  I should have realized then that Beverly was behaving strangely even for her.  But I just attributed her peculiarity to just that--Beverly always did whatever she wanted to and this was not the first time I saw her throw a temper tantrum.", "input": "", "output": "It was really that bad?  Do you know if Beverly is currently taking any antidepressants or other medications?"}, {"instruction": "I think she was given Prozac after her meltdown a few years ago.  But I don't know if she is still taking it.  The whole thing is sort of moot now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Let me just quickly get to the gist of the story.", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "Things were going okay and Beverly was acting as normal as she ever gets, and then on Wednesday I got a call from our nanny at around four in the afternoon--Grant was gone.", "input": "", "output": "Gone?"}, {"instruction": "Gone, gone.  Mary, our nanny, said that she put the boys down for a nap around one and everything was okay before that--they spent the morning in the park and Beverly went with them as she had for the last few days.  Mary said that she went up to check on them around three.  Roald had woken up by then, but was lying in his bed quietly.  Mary took him downstairs so he wouldn't wake up Grant who was still sleeping.  But when she didn't hear anything for another forty minutes, Mary went up to Grant's bedroom again.  That's when she discovered that Grant was missing.", "input": "", "output": "She looked around the house, of course?"}, {"instruction": "She asked Tom if he got him, but he was downstairs in the office all day and didn't know anything.  Tom and Mary searched the entire house--they first assumed that Beverly got Grant and was playing with him somewhere in the house or garden.  But neither of them was to be found.  They called me to see if I had made plans with Grant and Beverly and forgot to inform them.  But that was just out of desperation--by then they both knew that Beverly must have taken Grant and left.", "input": "", "output": "What would Beverly want with Grant?"}, {"instruction": "Mary said that she heard Beverly say a couple of times just how lucky we were to have not one but two wonderful children.  I don't know what Beverly was thinking.  I know she wanted to have children.  She even applied to adopt a child, but was turned down due to a poor psychiatric evaluation--she was clearly still too unstable to be responsible for a child.  She wasn't even doing well taking care of herself.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, where's Grant now?"}, {"instruction": "He's at home.  We've got him back Friday morning.", "input": "", "output": "Thank god!"}, {"instruction": "Those were the worst 48 hours of my life.", "input": "", "output": "I'm so sorry.  I had no idea."}, {"instruction": "Actually, everything turned out remarkably well at the end.  The manager of the hotel Beverly was staying saw her picture and the reward on the evening news.  When she came down for breakfast the next morning, he called the police.", "input": "", "output": "Where was she staying?"}, {"instruction": "She stayed in one of the resorts in the Monterey area.  I guess she figured that she could blend in with all the other guests better than if she stayed in some small obscure place.  I think she knew that she wouldn't be able to get away with this for too long.  She said that she just wanted to feel what it was like to be a mother even if it was just for a few short hours.  She said that she was just borrowing him.  I don't think she was really trying to be evil.", "input": "", "output": "Did she realize the worry and stress that she was inflicting on you and Tom?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure exactly just how much Beverly realizes about anything right now.  She did take very good care of Grant.  The hotel staff said that she seemed to be an extremely devoted mother and Grant didn't cry or appear to be upset being with her.  If it wasn't for the announcement on the news, I don't think we would have been able to find her so fast.  I'm very grateful to Lloyd for his generosity and support.", "input": "", "output": "Lloyd?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes.  When he found what was going on, he offered a $20,000 reward for any information leading to the safe recovery of my baby.  And he turned on the publicity machine.  I was amazed at how much television coverage he could generate--and so fast.", "input": "", "output": "I'm surprised.  I wouldn't have expected Lloyd to do that."}, {"instruction": "I'll be in Lloyd's debt forever.  I do believe he got my baby back to me.", "input": "", "output": "So Grant is fine?"}, {"instruction": "He perfectly all right.  I don't even think he knew what happened and, of course, he'll never remember this.  Tom and I, on the other hand...and god, my parents!  I couldn't tell my mother until it was all over, and even then I thought she'd have a heart attack.  How Rene managed to keep her out of our house for that long, I'll never know.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Sylvia.  This nightmare should not be experienced by any parent."}, {"instruction": "I know it's hard to see, but I've got a lot more gray now.", "input": "", "output": "How's Beverly?"}, {"instruction": "She is in a mental hospital.  I'm not sure what will happen to her next.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Look, Doctor, it's getting late.  You look very tired and I need to get home.  I'll see you next week, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, of course.  Take care of yourself, Sylvia.  And give my best to Tom."}, {"instruction": "I will.  Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor.  I'm well, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "You look tired.  Have you been getting enough sleep lately?"}, {"instruction": "I go to bed at a reasonable time and the boys sleep through most of the night now.", "input": "", "output": "That's good.  But have you been sleeping lately?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Why are having troubles sleeping?"}, {"instruction": "I can fall asleep just fine.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  But?"}, {"instruction": "I keep hearing the boys cry or some other noise wakes me up.", "input": "", "output": "Is it real, the crying or the noise?"}, {"instruction": "No, it's part of a dream.", "input": "", "output": "How many times a night does this happen?"}, {"instruction": "Seven?  Eight?  I'm not really sure.  But I wake up in cold sweat with my underarms hurting from fear.", "input": "", "output": "What are you afraid of?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not really sure.  Maybe of not hearing the boys when they do cry for real?", "input": "", "output": "Are you afraid of not being there for them when they need you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes...like that.", "input": "", "output": "Has it ever happened that you didn't wake up when either of the boys cried at night?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.", "input": "", "output": "I bet that never happened.  So you are not really worrying about not hearing the boys at night, are you?"}, {"instruction": "I wake up because I hear them cry.  But when I'm awake, it's all quiet.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mistakenly hear the boys cry when you're awake?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  At work, all the time.  I call home and Mary tells me that I just called half hour ago and yes everything is still fine.  But if no one answers the phone at home...it's so bad that I had to leave work three times last week.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  What do you think could happen to the boys when you're not around?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I know nothing's wrong, Doctor.  I understand that, but it's on some abstract intellectual level.  Emotionally, I panic and have to work hard to restrain the need to just rush home to them as fast as I can.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't feel that way prior to Beverly taking Grant, did you?"}, {"instruction": "I might have, but it was never this intense.  Now, I can't resist it.  It's blinding fear.", "input": "", "output": "Where is Beverly now?"}, {"instruction": "She's still in a psychiatric facility.  She suffered a total nervous breakdown and they were worried for safety.", "input": "", "output": "Did she try to commit suicide?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, I guess so.  I have to admit that I have trouble relating when it comes to Beverly.  I know Tom's parents are out here and, together with Tom, they've been dealing.  But Tom has left me very much out of it, thankfully.", "input": "", "output": "How's Tom doing?"}, {"instruction": "He's being very strong about everything.  But I know that he's having problems as well.", "input": "", "output": "What did you notice?"}, {"instruction": "He's been doing most of his work in the kitchen now.  The kitchen is adjacent to the playroom, and Tom can easily keep an eye on everything that's going on there.  He also doesn't allow our babysitters to take the boys on walks now.  He insists that they are too young for that and that they can get all the fresh air and interaction with nature they need from our back yard.  And I have to say that I'm very happy that he's made this rule...he's been enforcing it with a vengeance.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Do you know if Tom also has been having difficulties sleeping?"}, {"instruction": "I noticed that he's been up a few times that I've been up, but I'm not sure if it isn't my fault.  I could be waking him up with my reaction to my dreams--I usually end up sitting up in bed with a sort of a start.  Tom has always been a light sleeper and...", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  I think you are both having a lot of difficulties dealing with the post traumatic effects of Grant's kidnapping."}, {"instruction": "Except it wasn't really that.", "input": "", "output": "You mean it wasn't a kidnapping?"}, {"instruction": "I don't believe that Beverly would have hurt Grant in any way.  I think she was telling the truth when she said that she just wanted to experience motherhood, if only on a limited basis and for a short time.", "input": "", "output": "Beverly might be telling the truth about that, but it doesn't change the fact that she took Grant away from you for two days and only returned him when police came to get her and the baby.  The time you and Tom spent worrying about the whereabouts of your son and his welfare cannot be negated by the fact that everything turned out all right in the end.  You were both admittedly extremely worried."}, {"instruction": "I know, but...", "input": "", "output": "You knew that Beverly was mentally unstable and..."}, {"instruction": "And anything could have happened.  I get sick just touching upon that thought.  I think I have been actively not thinking about what could have happened for all this time.", "input": "", "output": "But as soon as you fall asleep..."}, {"instruction": "I lose control and panic at the realization that I could have lost my son.", "input": "", "output": "And I think Tom feels the same way."}, {"instruction": "You know, we leave the door to our bedroom open at night now.  This way we're sure to hear if anything...", "input": "", "output": "You're taking precautions to minimize your risks in the future.  That's perfectly normal."}, {"instruction": "I hope this anxiety gets better with time, Doctor.  Otherwise I doubt that I'm going to be able to let my children go to school, far less go to the playground.", "input": "", "output": "It will get better."}, {"instruction": "Poor Beverly.  I bet she's freaked too.  There are occasional bursts of sympathy that I'm capable of feeling for her.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that.  Are you pressing charges?"}, {"instruction": "No.  That would bring too much pain to the family and all concerned.  And she is not likely to do anything like this in the future.  Even if she wanted to, there is no chance that she'll ever be alone in the same room with my sons.", "input": "", "output": "I guess not."}, {"instruction": "You know, through all of this, Richard called and expressed his concern over Grant's safety to Tom.", "input": "", "output": "Only concerns?"}, {"instruction": "Tom thinks that he wants to use this incident to his advantage in the custody suit.", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "We're incompetent parents with crazy relatives and all that.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  Do you think that Richard will do that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I haven't spoken with him in such a long time...but in any event, there's that concern as well.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that Richard's case has very much merit, so..."}, {"instruction": "I know. It's just a nuisance.  But it's just one more thing to wear me down.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "I better go; it's getting late.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I'll see you next week.  Please give me a call if you're still having problems sleeping in the next few days.  I can..."}, {"instruction": "I don't think so, Doctor.  I'm still breast feeding, remember?  Sleeping pills are right out for me.  But thanks.  I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor.  Oh, I almost forgot.  I got you these.  I thought you might be interested in how the boys look like now.", "input": "", "output": "I am, very.  Thank you, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Thank you for being interested.  It's always a mother's guilty pleasure to inundate her friends and therapist with pictures of her babies.  Goodbye, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye.  They're very cute."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  I just have to tell you that we'll have to make it short today.  We're having dinner with Tom's parents at six and...", "input": "", "output": "You don't have to explain, Sylvia.  But six is a tight deadline, are you sure you don't want to simply cancel for today?"}, {"instruction": "That was my plan, but Tom insisted that I go.  He believes that you keep me sane, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that Tom appreciates what we do here."}, {"instruction": "He does.  So we're going to talk about Beverly at dinner.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Tom's parents want her to be released from the mental facility.  She's been responding well to medications and they want her to have as normal a life as she can which, of course, requires being out in the real world.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  And what do you think?"}, {"instruction": "I'm trying not to impose my opinions.  But Tom is completely opposed to the idea.  He thinks that Beverly is not capable of being responsible for herself and her actions.  He said that the only way he would consent to her release is if she has a legal guardian at all times.  Tom's parents are freaked at the idea.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "I don't understand exactly.  I think it would have been okay if they could be the guardians.  But they are too old to be dealing in that way.  They are very angry at Tom for insisting on this condition.", "input": "", "output": "Does Tom have any say in this?"}, {"instruction": "He threatened to file criminal charges against Beverly, if they release her without a guardian.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So dinner tonight is to resolve this issue?"}, {"instruction": "Things were getting out of hand, so I wanted to give it a try by setting up a family atmosphere in which everyone could talk and express their opinions.  I also wanted Tom's parents to be in the presence of the boys.  I think the boys actually being there as real people might influence their decision Tom's way.", "input": "", "output": "Good idea.  I assume they are devoted grandparents?"}, {"instruction": "Very.  And the boys are their first and last chance at grandparenting.  They are a strong argument in Tom's favor.", "input": "", "output": "Are you stressed about tonight?"}, {"instruction": "I guess you can tell I'm feeling very edgy.  It'll be okay.  I just want very much to put the whole incident behind me.  And helping Tom resolve the Beverly family crisis would get me a long way there.", "input": "", "output": "I agree."}, {"instruction": "Can we not talk about this any more?  I want to clear my mind before I have to face the music at home.", "input": "", "output": "No problem.  Do mind talking about other difficult subjects or would you rather..."}, {"instruction": "Everything else is fine.  I just don't want to talk about Beverly.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I wanted to ask you about Richard.  Have you seen him lately?"}, {"instruction": "As the matter of fact, I have.  He had an interesting idea and my department is going to adopt it in our efforts to communicate technical information to our clients.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Richard is talking about the way people remember and file away information.  It's mostly done through storytelling--you have a better shot at remembering information if it is presented via an interesting and relevant story, then if you read something in a technical manual.  Hence, if we're trying to teach people how to troubleshoot our hardware and software, we have a better chance at doing that if we can tell them stories of actual problems experienced by other users and how they managed to arrive at a solution.  We've set up an online section where we encourage people to post their problems and their stories.  And we are actually including the reasoning and motives behind the design decisions on which our products are based--we include anecdotes told by our engineers about the development process as part of the technical information we provide.  I think it's really going to help.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds very interesting."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  Richard is a very smart man.  And while his idea is not all that original--user groups have been doing this kind of support for a long time--the execution he's come up with is brilliant.  I almost feel bad now that the Apple deal cratered.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, I didn't know that was all over."}, {"instruction": "After the board of directors meeting...it's a long story.  But I believe that Apple could have benefited by becoming part of SII.  We have a very different culture when it comes to supporting our customers and developer base--we treat them well.  We go out of our way to understand and meet their needs.  Apple...it's painful to watch a company blow it that bad.  But, oh well.", "input": "", "output": "Did you actually have to work with Richard on this project?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.  We had a meeting and have been exchanging some materials and ideas on how to best accomplish his vision. But other than that...no, I don't have to be in the same room with him or even to talk to him very often.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  I'm impressed that given your feelings about him, you were able to enthusiasticly grab onto his idea."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.  I'm pissed but not stupid.  But I have to say, Richard looks very bad--he's got thin and sort of withered.  He looks about ten years older.  I guess lawsuits just don't agree with him.  God, I've got to go.  I didn't realize it was so late.  See you next week?", "input": "", "output": "Of course.  Good luck on your dinner."}, {"instruction": "Thanks, I need it.  Good night, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, please come in.  How are you?  How was your week?"}, {"instruction": "It had its moments.", "input": "", "output": "How did your dinner with Tom's parents go?"}, {"instruction": "It was very civil.  Tom's mom cried a bit, but overall it went fine.", "input": "", "output": "Did Tom get what he wanted?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the point is a bit moot now, actually.", "input": "", "output": "I don't understand.  Does Beverly have a guardian?"}, {"instruction": "Beverly will have many guardians for a long long time.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, let me get my thoughts together--I had a long day.  The dinner.  The dinner went very well.  Tom's parents reluctantly agreed that Beverly is just not ready to handle the responsibly of living on her own just yet.  And we reached a compromise--Beverly will have an attendant at all times.  Her father will be her conservator.  And this will remain in effect for one year past her release from the mental hospital.  After that, there will be a review.  If two psychiatrists certify Beverly as capable of resuming her normal life, then she would be free to live alone as long as she continues weekly therapy sessions.  If at any point...you get the idea, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like a very reasonable solution.  So what's seems to be the problem?"}, {"instruction": "My mother.", "input": "", "output": "Your mother?  I'm afraid I'm still in the dark."}, {"instruction": "I know.  It's a complicated story, so give me a moment.", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "As you can imagine, my mother reacted very poorly when she heard of Grant's kidnapping.  Tom and I were so worried that her heart wouldn't take the news well, that we didn't let her find anything out until after it was all over and Grant was sitting safely in her lap.", "input": "", "output": "That makes a certain amount of sense."}, {"instruction": "Her doctors were very clear about the potential risks of stress and anxiety on her health.  I even considered not saying anything to her at all.  But the story was all over the media, and my dad could only keep her in the dark for so long.", "input": "", "output": "So your dad knew from the start?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  We had to tell him; he was the only one who could keep my mother away from our house for so long.  It was a tough job.  I know he was as upset about the kidnaping as we were.  But he couldn't show it.  He pretended to have bad stomach problems for a few days and nights.  That allowed him to be in a bad mood and to act irrationally, effectively covering up his real feelings.  It worked.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  So how does your mother fit into this story now?"}, {"instruction": "Well, what I didn't realize was just how angry my mother was at Beverly.  My mother is from the old school--she doesn't believe in such thing as being a little crazy.  You're either all gone or you're faking it.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  I hate to ask, but how does she feel about your therapy?"}, {"instruction": "We don't talk about it.  She knows that I see someone on a regular basis, but I think she considers this a small price to pay for becoming a grandmother.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But when she heard that Beverly was going to be released from the mental hospital, she was outraged.  To her, there were only two options.  One, Beverly is a certified nut and is put away for life in a mental institution.  Or, if she's released, she has to face charges and spend time in jail for her deeds.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  How did she find out about Beverly's release?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I certainly wasn't going to tell her.", "input": "", "output": "I thought not."}, {"instruction": "But Rene was happy to.  Rene and Beverly never really got along.  Rene thought that Beverly was just \"a waste of flesh\"--a rich spoiled brat not capable of even making coffee without assistance.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "Rene felt that my mother \"deserved\" to know what was happening.  And after fully briefing my mother on the current situation with Beverly, Rene took her over for a visit.", "input": "", "output": "Rene took your mother to visit Beverly in the hospital?"}, {"instruction": "Rene was even more helpful than that.  She helped my mother pick out photographs of Grant and Roald to take with her and show Beverly.", "input": "", "output": "What were they trying to do?"}, {"instruction": "When they got to the hospital, they were able to sign in as visiting family.  They met Beverly in the garden.  Apparently she was very happy to see them, and the hospital staff left them alone--remember that they were going to release her in just a day or two.", "input": "", "output": "I remember."}, {"instruction": "And as Rene sat quietly and observed, my mother drove Beverly into a state of a raging lunacy.  When she got through with showing Beverly pictures of Roald and Grant, she went on to telling sweet anecdotes from their lives.  Then when Beverly was judged ready, my mother described how she could have been responsible for Grant's death.  Rene told me that she was quite graphic.  Needless to say, Beverly didn't handle the conversation well.  When Rene called for a nurse, Beverly completely lost it.  She flailed around and started resisting the nurses. They ended up subdueing her and taking her away in a straitjacket.", "input": "", "output": "That's a horrible story!"}, {"instruction": "I'm not saying that I approve of any of it.  I think my mother was just trying to protect her darlings.  In some way though, if it was that easy to get Beverly off balance, then I don't think she was ready to be released.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  How are Tom's parents reacting to all of this?"}, {"instruction": "Tom's dad is being very strong.  I think he's already resigned to the fact that his daughter is going to have a problem for the rest of her life.  He might have hoped that she was more stable than she is, but I think he accepts the situation.", "input": "", "output": "And Tom's mother?"}, {"instruction": "I think she might need therapy.  Her opinion is that we all--including the whole world--are against Beverly.  Only she's capable of seeing Beverly's goodness and true nature.", "input": "", "output": "No one is questioning Beverly goodness, are they?"}, {"instruction": "No, of course not.  Only her sanity.  But the two are somehow linked, at least for Tom's mother.  You know, Doctor, you would probably think that I'm very callous and even...oh, skip it.", "input": "", "output": "You can tell me anything, Sylvia.  I don't think at this point you can tell me something that would fundamentally change my opinion of you.  Besides, I'm not your judge.  I'm your therapist."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  I'm happy that Grant and Roald are not Tom's biological children.  Because if mental illness runs in families, I would really be worried now.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Worrying about issues like that is not a bad thing by itself.  You're a mother.  I would expect you to worry about stuff like that."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but that's a bit twisted, don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "It's not what came to my mind.  But these are not my children.  I think parents--and mothers in particular--have a fairly unique outlook on the world.  The well-being of their children is of paramount importance, overshadowing almost everything else.  That perspective is substantially different from that of the rest of us."}, {"instruction": "Well put, Doctor.  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "So what will happen to Beverly now?"}, {"instruction": "She'll remain at the California Pacific mental facility for a period of time and then, when she's judged ready, they'll relocate her to New York to be near her parents.", "input": "", "output": "Do you know what her diagnosis is?"}, {"instruction": "I think she's a full blown schizophrenic now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm very sorry."}, {"instruction": "I am too.  Although I'm more worried about Tom and how all this effects him.  He hasn't been sleeping well for days now.  I caught him sitting on a chair in Grant's room in the middle of the night just staring at the boy.  And I know he's been watching Roald too.  And his mother calls him several times a day.  He's just about reached his limit.", "input": "", "output": "Have you thought of trying to get away somewhere for a few days?  You, Tom, and the boys--the whole family."}, {"instruction": "Perhaps that's a good idea.  Although, I don't know how I could get away from work--it's been really hard trying to get my department to function normally again.", "input": "", "output": "How is your project with Richard coming along?"}, {"instruction": "It's not my project with Richard.  I'm just implementing an idea that the future research department recommended.  I'm not working with Richard!", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  So how's that coming along?"}, {"instruction": "Just fine.  It's getting late, Doctor.  I'll see you next week, okay?", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week, Sylvia.  Have a good Fourth of July."}, {"instruction": "You too, Doctor.  I hope you have a wonderful holiday...and forgive me for overreacting like this.", "input": "", "output": "No problem.  Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Sylvia.  You look tired."}, {"instruction": "I thought your job was to make me feel better.", "input": "", "output": "Just an observation, I didn't mean to..."}, {"instruction": "I know.  It was a very long weekend, Doctor.  Way too much family togetherness, if you know what I mean.", "input": "", "output": "I think so.  Are Tom's parents still in town?"}, {"instruction": "No.  They finally left Saturday night.  Tom's dad couldn't be away from his law practice any longer.  As it is, he stayed too long.  They both stayed too long!", "input": "", "output": "I hear a lot of resentment..."}, {"instruction": "Resentment?  How about open hostility, Doctor.  Do you hear any anger?  Maybe a touch of hate?", "input": "", "output": "Wow!  What happened?"}, {"instruction": "Somehow, Tom and I ended up hosting the family Fourth of July party.  My parents were there, Rene was there, even my brother was there, and, of course, Tom's parents.  Beverly couldn't make it.", "input": "", "output": "Somehow, I didn't think she would."}, {"instruction": "Tom's mom thought it would have been a good idea.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "It was very ugly, Doctor Balis.  We were all sitting on our roof deck, and Tom's mom just started.  She was saying how wonderful Beverly was as a girl and how lucky my mom was that her children could be with her on the holidays.  Can you imagine?  The tension in the air could have been chopped with an ax.  I was dying.  But my mom...she just accepted it as her due--yes, her children and grandchildren are clearly wonderful.", "input": "", "output": "Does Tom's mother know about your mom's visit to the hospital to see Beverly?"}, {"instruction": "She must.  While she might not know all the details of that visit, the doctors told her of Beverly's reaction to it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Nina--Tom's mother--sat on the sofa all night and kept putting away martinis, one after another.  My mom sat across from her and played with Grant and Roald most of the evening.  My mom was happy, and it was eating Nina up inside.  We should have canceled the whole evening when Nina called and tried to make arrangements to bring Beverly with her.  Tom and I were both against that idea.  Tom went to visit with her that morning, and aside from the social awkwardness that her presence would have resulted in, she was clearly not up to it.  But Tom's mom just wouldn't let go of it.  She just kept talking about how wonderful Beverly is and how understanding and sensitive.  And what a wonderful mother she could have been.", "input": "", "output": "Mother?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, mother.  I guess she meant if everything turned out differently...I don't know.  But it was just awful.  And I could see that my mother was starting to lose it.  I was hoping to distract everyone long enough to finish dinner and then end this melodrama before it got out of hand.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "People are just not capable of eating that fast, Doctor.  Nina accused my mother of faking her accent.", "input": "", "output": "But she's French."}, {"instruction": "She's been here long enough to learn proper English.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "She even called french people \"frogs.\"", "input": "", "output": "She used it the way you might use the word \"kike\" or \"wog\" or something?"}, {"instruction": "Can you imagine?  She kept poking and poking at my mom: Beverly this and Beverly that.  And while she never openly accused my mother of anything, she clearly implied that she had done something horribly wrong.  Finally, my mother had enough.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah?"}, {"instruction": "She told Nina that she would never understand her--Nina will never really know what it means to be a grandparent because Grant and Roald are not her true grandchildren.", "input": "", "output": "Oh no."}, {"instruction": "Nina freaked out. She called me a whore and my children fatherless bastards.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, Sylvia..."}, {"instruction": "Then Tom lost it and told Nina that it was her fault that Beverly is in a mental institution right now.  That if she didn't insist on Beverly having all those abortions when she first started to go out with her ex-husband, she might still be married with children of her own and she'd have her sanity now.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't know that..."}, {"instruction": "Beverly's husband was black.  But this wasn't some great social divide from the wrong side of the tracks or something.  It's kind of like that movie, \"Guess Whose Coming to Dinner.\"  Syd wasn't a neurosurgeon--but he was a brilliant law student going to Yale.  He was on the law review, high honors, that kind of thing.  He joined Tom's father's firm after graduation.  Syd was a talented lawyer and he was a very kind and sensitive husband.  But when Nina went over his head--Syd never knew she was pregnant until afterwards--and insisted on Beverly getting rid of a \"mixed race\" child, he just exploded.", "input": "", "output": "How awful!"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. For a while after they got married, Syd and Beverly severed all contact with her parents. I'm not sure of all my details, but I think Beverly spent a few months in a mental institution at that time as well.", "input": "", "output": "But Beverly and Syd tried having children after that, right?"}, {"instruction": "For years.  But either the abortions were poorly executed or she just got lucky those two times, but she was never able to get pregnant again.  The years of trying and using fertility drugs destroyed their marriage.  I haven't heard from Syd in five years.  He left Bows, Edwards, and Peterson just after they got married.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  There were two abortions?"}, {"instruction": "I know there were two, but I don't know much more than that.", "input": "", "output": "So Tom brought this whole story up during your Fourth of July dinner?"}, {"instruction": "After the steak but before desert.", "input": "", "output": "A full evening of family togetherness."}, {"instruction": "I'm telling you, Doctor. If I never see Tom's mother again, it will be too soon.  And I do wish that my mother exhibited a bit more restraint during the evening as well.  She knew that what she did to Beverly was outrageous regardless of how noble her motives might have seemed to her.  She should just have ignored Nina and let her get quietly drunk.  Instead she pushed back.  And the entire time, Rene just sat there and let herself be amused by the circus around her.  She could have tried to run interference.  God, what a disaster!", "input": "", "output": "Your relationship with Tom's mom seems pretty much destroyed for the moment.  How does Tom feel?"}, {"instruction": "He was furious when Nina called the kids \"fatherless bustards.\" He got very cold and told her that Roald and Grant are his sons and that if she has trouble accepting that she was not welcomed in our home.  I think the way he looked at her and the sound of his voice scared Nina--she apologized.  Tom's dad took her back to the hotel after that.  They left the next day without saying goodbye.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I swear, it feels like a huge rock's been lifted off my chest.  I can't wait until Beverly is well enough to travel.  With all of them gone, life would be a lot more peaceful.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Sylvia.  You had a very tough holiday. I'm still recommending that you and Tom and the boys should go away somewhere and rest for a few days.  You all deserve it."}, {"instruction": "I'm thinking about it.  Tom's birthday is coming up in a few weeks, maybe I'll surprise him.  You know, I didn't even celebrate my birthday this year?  Somehow it just didn't seem so important.  I even stopped remembering how old I was--I just recalculate it from the birth year each time I need to know.  Time's just going by so quickly.", "input": "", "output": "When was your birthday?"}, {"instruction": "In April.  Please don't ask me how old I am, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I won't."}, {"instruction": "You were right--I'm very tired, Doctor.  I think I would like to go home now.  All right?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "It's going to be our one year anniversary next Tuesday.  Did you know?", "input": "", "output": "No.  But you're right; July 15th is when we first met.  That was the first day that I started practicing after I moved out from New York.  Funny, it doesn't seem so long ago."}, {"instruction": "Seems like a long time to me.  There's been a lot of changes in my life since then--I'm a mother now.", "input": "", "output": "You've come a long way, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "l'll see you next week, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  See you next week."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. Happy anniversary!", "input": "", "output": "Oh, happy anniversary, Sylvia.  It's precisely a year to the day that we started our sessions together."}, {"instruction": "I know.  It's unbelievable to me.  God, a whole year...oh, I'm sorry that I'm so late again.  I know that I've been doing a lot of it lately.  But with boys, and the job, and the family...it's just been so hard orchestrating my life and having time to make everyone happy.  You understand, don't you, Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "I do. I actually meant to talk to you about that.  I can see how hard it is for you to squirrel away time for our sessions from your very busy schedule.  Would you be interested in reducing the number of sessions to...let's see, maybe one or two visits a month?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "I'm not raising this issue because I'm not interested in seeing you anymore, Sylvia.  I just want to make sure that our arrangement works for you.  In our year together, we've solved all the original issues that you came to see me for last July."}, {"instruction": "But, Doctor...", "input": "", "output": "I know stuff happens all the time--Beverly, the family, work.  But there will always be something.  And I would love to talk to you about things that go on in your life, things that bother you, events that concern you.  But your time seems to be very tight right now. Instead of feeling guilty for being late to a session on top of feeling guilty about leaving work early and not getting home soon enough, why don't we cut down on the number of sessions?"}, {"instruction": "I guess that makes some sense.  It's just that I've grown so used to having you.", "input": "", "output": "You'll still have me."}, {"instruction": "But not as much.  I don't know, Doctor.  I'll think about it, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Good.  Now, what would you like to dedicate our anniversary session to?"}, {"instruction": "Sex.", "input": "", "output": "Sex?"}, {"instruction": "Well, actually the lack of it.", "input": "", "output": "Are you and Tom experiencing problems again?"}, {"instruction": "It's not so much Tom as it is me.  I just feel completely run down.  I get up early in the morning and deal with the boys--which even with Tom's and our nanny's help can be a handful.  Then I rush to get dressed and to get to the office by no later than nine-thirty.  When I get to work, I'm literally assaulted by a mob of people needing my attention and expecting decisions so that they can meet their dead-lines.  I wrestle my way out by about five-thirty, unless I'm coming over to see you that day.  When I get home, I barely have enough time to rip my shirt off, and Grant and Roald settle in for about half an hour of intense breast-feeding.  Then somehow dinner happens.  And before I know it, it's time to put the boys down for the night.  Part of the bed time ritual is bath and mommy time.  By ten, Grant and Roald are out cold.  And, I have to say, I'm not far behind them.  But I still need to do some work to catch up on the previous day's work.  When I hit the bed, all I want is sleep.  And even when my mind and spirit is willing, my body is too dead to respond to Tom sexually.", "input": "", "output": "How many times a week do you actually manage to make love to Tom?"}, {"instruction": "I don't really know.  I think it might be once. Sometimes, twice.  And each time I have to force myself into it.  And, Doctor, please believe me that I love Tom and find him extremely attractive.  I always watch when he undresses at night--I still get a little thrill seeing him naked.  And I have sexual fantasies about him all the time.  So it's not that.  It's this feeling of overwhelming exhaustion.", "input": "", "output": "Have you talked to Tom about this?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not keeping it a secret.  I have nothing to hide.  I tell Tom the truth--I'm tired.", "input": "", "output": "And how does Tom react?"}, {"instruction": "He's disappointed.  He hasn't accused me of anything, although...", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "I was thinking about it from his point of view.  Here I am always telling him how I'm just too tired to make love to him.", "input": "", "output": "He believes you that you are?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But he must also think about all those times, just a few short months ago, when I was brimming over with energy, enthusiasm, and willingness to do it with everybody else.  Sure, I have no time or energy for him now.  But nine months ago, I was fucking three to four guys a week several times a day.  See?", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Tom is very understanding.  But somehow I don't think the comparison has escaped him. I know he must think about it.  And when I think about it, I feel angry for Tom. He didn't get a fair deal. If I were him, I'd be upset.", "input": "", "output": "It seems to me that you're projecting a lot of feelings onto Tom that he might not actually have.  He's never talked to you about all that, has he?  This is all from your imagination, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, but we sort of developed a code of silence when it comes to my sexual escapades of that time.  Bringing it up, and particularly under these circumstances, would be in very bad taste.  And I believe it could damage our relationship.  I know that Tom feels the same way, for he has never even hinted about that since we got back together.", "input": "", "output": "I'm not suggesting that you rehash that issue with Tom.  Actually, you're problem isn't primarily sexual--it has more to do with the physical and temporal demands in your life right now.  I know I suggested it before, but I really think that getting away for a while with Tom and the boys would be very beneficial--free yourself from the concerns from work or your extended family.  The rest would do you a lot of good and it would certainly improve your relationship with Tom."}, {"instruction": "So I should schedule time to go away and fuck my husband's brains out.  Is that it?", "input": "", "output": "Crudely put, perhaps, but I believe that he would like that.  And I think you'd like that too.  Bring a nanny.  Bring two nannies. Arrange to spend some quality time alone with Tom."}, {"instruction": "God, that sounds so good. But what about work?", "input": "", "output": "They've managed without you before.  And you don't have to be gone for a long time.  At this point, a few days would be good--a long weekend, perhaps.  And, maybe, you can even make your get-away weekends with Tom a regular thing."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, we're out of time for today, Sylvia.  Please think about what I said, including the part about reducing the number of our sessions to one or two a month.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doctor Balis.  I'll see you next week?", "input": "", "output": "If you insist."}, {"instruction": "Well, you didn't mean to start now, did you?", "input": "", "output": "I guess not.  I'll see you next week, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.  Goodbye, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  What's going on?", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I might be your patient and our sessions revolve around my problems.  But I'm not blind.  What's going on?", "input": "", "output": "I didn't think it was that obvious."}, {"instruction": "It is to me.", "input": "", "output": "My dad had a stroke."}, {"instruction": "Oh god! I'm very sorry.  He's in New York, isn't he?  Did you fly out to see him?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  I got phone call from my mother on Tuesday night and I canceled all my appointments and..."}, {"instruction": "Is he all right?  Well, I mean...", "input": "", "output": "Actually he is doing very well.  They were in a restaurant when it happened.  At first, my mother thought that he was choking on something.  But then...I shouldn't be telling you any of this.  I'm your doctor.  Let's get back to you."}, {"instruction": "Charles, I consider you a lot more than a doctor.  You've been a real friend.  Your welfare and happiness actually mean a lot to me.  I'm very sorry about your dad.  And I'm worried about you.  So please--I won't be able to talk to you about my problems while thinking that you're hurting inside and thinking about your dad.", "input": "", "output": "Well, there's really not that much to tell."}, {"instruction": "Hmm.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I got to the hospital Wednesday afternoon.  He was at Columbia Presbyterian in Manhattan--my old stomping grounds.  When my mother called, I couldn't help but imagine the worst.  I've seen lots of stoke victims and the idea...but he's okay."}, {"instruction": "Really?", "input": "", "output": "It wasn't as bad as my mom thought.  He's home already.  He still has some weakness in his right arm, but other than that...he was very lucky."}, {"instruction": "Oh, Charles...", "input": "", "output": "We were very lucky."}, {"instruction": "I know how you must have felt.  When I found out about my mom's heart...excuse me.  It was like a dream.  Nothing felt real.  I kept expecting myself to wake up and find everything back to normal.  Even now, there are times when I look at her and see this tiny fragile woman who just doesn't match my internal image of mother in any way. I guess I'm trying to say that I'm sorry, in my own convoluted way.  I'm glad your dad is okay.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you."}, {"instruction": "If...", "input": "", "output": "The feelings you've just described are pretty common.  As children, people tend to think of their parents as invincible--they are big, strong, and always around.  And it's important that these feeling are there--a child's survival depends on it.  And while a child might not know or understand this intellectually, emotionally..."}, {"instruction": "Charles, let go.  You don't have to be a psychiatrist every moment of your life.  I bet when you were in New York sitting with your mother in the hospital, you were still analyzing the situation.  It's okay to be just upset or scared.  Even if you are a doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  You make a good therapist, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.  It must have rubbed off.  But seriously, why did you come back so soon?  You're entitled to take time off.  And in our whole year together, you never did take time off for vacation, did you?", "input": "", "output": "No.  But I have responsibilities to my patients..."}, {"instruction": "I have responsibilities too.  And you've been very encouraging--even insistent--that I blow them off and take time for myself and my family.  Remember?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, but..."}, {"instruction": "I think we'll be fine, Doctor.  As much as I and all your other patients need you, we'll all understand that you might need some time off for yourself.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, I really appreciate your concern.  I really do.  But I...well, I did take time off last week and I would like to stop talking about this now."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'm sorry, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, I didn't mean it the way it came out.  I do appreciate your concern."}, {"instruction": "It's okay.", "input": "", "output": "I'm lucky--my dad is fine. And I think all of this will make him take much better care of himself."}, {"instruction": "Good.", "input": "", "output": "Now, how about you?  Did you talk about taking time off with Tom?"}, {"instruction": "Actually I did.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "Tom wasn't as enthusiastic about the idea as I thought he would be.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Something about a project he's working on right now.  He has to be around.  So maybe next month...", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "He was very strange about it, though.  Well, I don't know.  I think I'm more sensitive to his mood changes. I've been noticing Tom get a lot more irritable and his sleeping problems are worse.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk to him about that?"}, {"instruction": "He's blaming everything on this project.  Personally, I think that this is about Beverly and his mom.  Tom's relationship with his mom is very strained right now.  She clearly blames him for Beverly's current situation and resents Tom for not taking her side and defending Beverly.  And I know that Tom believes that Beverly's mental problems come from his mother's bigotry--if it wasn't for her, Beverly would still be married and probably have children.", "input": "", "output": "You don't really know that."}, {"instruction": "No.  But...", "input": "", "output": "What do you think about Tom's mom in general?"}, {"instruction": "You mean do I like her?", "input": "", "output": "Do you?"}, {"instruction": "No, not really.  Although our relationship has always been very civil in the past.  Things have changed now that she knows about Roald and Grant.  But I'm supportive of Tom's efforts to maintain a close relationship with his parents, if that what you're really asking.", "input": "", "output": "Does Tom have a close relationship with his parents?"}, {"instruction": "It's more formal than it is close. But I believe that Tom loves his parents, and they do care about him in their own way.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "When Tom married me, he went against his parents' wishes.  They had plans for him.  He was going to marry a nice society girl and shoot up the New York society ladder.  But he chose me instead.", "input": "", "output": "Have Tom's parents come to terms with that?"}, {"instruction": "They didn't have a choice.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I think when Tom married me, he also married me for my mother.  He has a far better and more emotionally satisfying relationship with her that he ever did with his own mother.  And of course my mother was more than happy to adopt Tom.", "input": "", "output": "Are you jealous?"}, {"instruction": "I told you when I resented their relationship--I hated when my mom took Tom's side and judged his vasectomy as reasonable under the circumstances.  But that's the past, and I don't want to go there.  I'm glad now that my relationship with her is on a more stable footing.  If anything happened to her while...that would have been a very hard burden to bear for me.  Are you close to your parents?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Good.  When something happens to our parents, I think we all feel young and old at the same time.  I felt like a little lost girl when I saw my mom get sick.  And at the same time, I got a sense of being very old--like my turn was approaching--I was about to take my place in the older generation.  It's like as long as someone's above you, you're young.", "input": "", "output": "You mean as long as there's someone older?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, a generation above.  You know, Doctor, there was a time in my life when it seemed like I had a wedding to go to almost every month.  All my friends were getting married.  Then it was the baby showers.  Now, I'm afraid, it will be the funerals.", "input": "", "output": "Yeah."}, {"instruction": "Well, on that happy thought, I think I'll take my leave and go home to my husband and children.  I'm glad everything worked out okay with your dad, Charles.  If there's something I can do for you, please don't hesitate to...", "input": "", "output": "Thank you, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you next week...oh, actually, I won't.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I have a product shipping next week, and I just don't think I'll get a chance to get away.  So I'll see the following week, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Let me see...that would be August the 5th?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "All right, I'll see you then."}, {"instruction": "Take care of yourself, Charles.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Come, sit down.  How's your project?  Did it ship on time?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, more or less.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. How are the boys?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, lovely.  They're doing just lovely.  Feeding times are a bit messy now, but other than that...", "input": "", "output": "I guess they're on solid foods all ready, right?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, we're just starting with mushed carrots, bananas--that sort of thing.  But mostly it's still formula and breast milk.", "input": "", "output": "Good, good.  Sylvia?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm?", "input": "", "output": "You are in a very strange mood today--I can't even engage you in a conversation about your children.  What's up?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't know I was that obvious.", "input": "", "output": "You're not.  But what's going on?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I told you about the project that I was working on?", "input": "", "output": "The one based on Richard's recommendations?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  As I told you, I've tried really hard to stay away from him during this project and only interacted with him in a very business-like manner.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "This last week, we had a real push to get this thing out of the door.  We've all put in a lot of extra hours.  I wasn't able to get home until way after nine on most days.", "input": "", "output": "That must have been hard on you and the family."}, {"instruction": "Sure.  But I've known that it would probably work out like that, and Tom knew.  So we had it all figured out ahead of time.", "input": "", "output": "Did Richard have to work late with you as well?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "No, I don't think you do, Doctor.  Okay, let me explain what happened.  We were finishing up late Wednesday night.  At some point, it was just Richard and I taking a final look over all the materials we had prepared.  And while it was possible to maintain a very business-like attitude and manner while we were surrounded by tons of people, when we were alone, I started to feel very uncomfortable.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "At first, it wasn't even anything that Richard particularly did.  He's passionate about this project and was very focused on getting it done.  But somehow, he was always just a bit too close to me.  Or his voice would sound different when he addressed me.  I don't even know that anyone else noticed anything, but I felt very unnerved by him.", "input": "", "output": "Did these feelings increase when you were alone together?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, absolutely.  I kept moving away from him, constantly trying to be on the other side of the table--I wanted a physical barrier separating us.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Finally, Richard called me on it.", "input": "", "output": "What did you tell him?"}, {"instruction": "I told him the truth--I didn't feel comfortable working with him.  I told him that I thought it would be best if we called it a day.  But as I started to put things away, Richard came over and took me by the shoulders.  I almost screamed--it was shocking and his touch was nearly painful, burning.", "input": "", "output": "What did Richard want from you?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he found it remarkable that I could just discard him the way I did without any thought to his feelings.  I told him that whatever it is, he should not be talking to me anymore.  If he had anything to say to me, he should contact my lawyers.  By filing a custody suit, he made it quite plain that our interactions could only be conducted through litigation.", "input": "", "output": "That's very wise."}, {"instruction": "Tom and I have talked about this.  We knew that it might be an issue if and when Richard and I would be working close together on a project.  And, in fact, it was Tom's suggestion to cut off Richard if he ever started to talk about personal matters and to refer him to our lawyers.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But he was holding me so close--his face right up to mine.  His eyes were burning right through me.  I tried pushing him away...", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "He told me that he knew that I was a tough bitch.  In fact, he said, he admired me for it.  But he said that he thought I would have understood once I knew that he was a condemned man.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't understand either and I told him so.  He let me go and his expression changed.  I asked him what he meant, and Richard said that he had cancer.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, he has testicular cancer!  That's why he wasn't looking so well.  And he explained that's his reason behind the lawsuit--Roald and Grant are his only shot at having children!", "input": "", "output": "He doesn't know for a fact that your boys are his children."}, {"instruction": "No, but there's a good chance that they are.", "input": "", "output": "That's still no reason to try and take your children away from you, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "No, it's not.  But I finally understand why he's doing it.  I always found it beneath him and it disturbed me not a little that I had so underestimated his character.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, he's still trying to take your children away from you."}, {"instruction": "Sure, but now at least he has a good reason for doing so.", "input": "", "output": "Are you sympathizing with Richard?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I just understand him now.  And he said that he disclosed the cancer in the lawsuit.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "But I never knew.  Tom always handled it, and he never told me.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps Tom thought that you would..."}, {"instruction": "React badly?", "input": "", "output": "That's not how I'd put it, but..."}, {"instruction": "Well, do you think I'm reacting badly?  I did use this man to get pregnant, and now he might be dying and he'll never be able to have any more children.  Grant and Roald are his only chances.  Somehow, it was better when I thought of Richard as this slithering poisonous snake.  But now that I know the truth, I feel differently.", "input": "", "output": "Well, how do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "I feel like I owe Richard something.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  Perhaps just an opportunity to find out if either of my kids are actually his.", "input": "", "output": "You mean like genetic testing?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  At least then he would know for sure.", "input": "", "output": "And then what?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I don't want him involved with my family, but on the other hand, it seems like it would be the right thing to do.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Oh god! Maybe he should be allowed to spend some time with the boys--to get to know his sons, if just a little.  Don't you think?", "input": "", "output": "It's not my decision to make.  But I do think that it's important that whatever you do is the right thing for your family first.  How does Tom feel about it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he obviously doesn't want Richard around, otherwise he would have told me about all this.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel strong enough about allowing Richard access to Grant and Roald even if Tom is against it?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I want Tom to understand.  Wouldn't he want that if he was in Richard's situation?", "input": "", "output": "Tom deprived himself of the opportunity to have a genetic offspring to try to insure your physical and mental health.  Remember?"}, {"instruction": "And also to avoid having children.", "input": "", "output": "I think his priority was your health, Sylvia.  He obviously adores Grant and Roald and is happy being their father, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, Richard made his choices in life.  And one of those choices were not to have children.  If you didn't come along, he would be dying without any progeny.  Grant and Roald are his miracle."}, {"instruction": "But he didn't know he was going to get sick.  He could have just never met the right person to have children with yet.", "input": "", "output": "No one knows what will happen in the future, Sylvia.  He could have been hit..."}, {"instruction": "By a bus, I know.  But I still feel bad.  I understand all of your arguments, Doctor Balis, but I still feel like I have to do something for Richard.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Well, don't rush into anything.  Think about all of the issues involved.  Think for a long time, and then think some more.  Talk to Tom about all of this--how you feel, and how he feels, and what's best for the boys.  Think of possible compromises.  And please don't do anything or make any ultimate decisions for a while.  Don't communicate any of your proposals to Richard, either.  You are still in litigation with that man, and it will come back to haunt you.  You really shouldn't talk to Richard about any of these matters--that's what your attorneys are for, okay?"}, {"instruction": "You're right.  I'll try to figure out how I really feel about all of this, and then I'll talk to you about it during our next session.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds good.  And perhaps we could even have a session with both you and Tom. I might be able to help both of you understand each other's points of view and work out a solution."}, {"instruction": "Give me a couple of weeks just to think about it for myself, and we can discuss the possibility of Tom joining us during our next session.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "As you wish, Sylvia.  I'll see you not this next Tuesday but the one following that.  Let's see, that's August 19th."}, {"instruction": "That's fine.  Thank you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  You know, I'm going to like coming in every other week.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "It's been hellish at work, and I'm beginning to feel like a stranger in my own home.  That's not what I wanted.", "input": "", "output": "Can you scale down on your activities at SII?"}, {"instruction": "Not in the next couple of weeks.  Remember that story-based project I talked to you about?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  What about it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we got quite a response.  People are sending in stories from all over the world.  We are scrambling to get people to answer the enormous flood of e-mail we've got.  And the stories...they are priceless, Doctor.  If I were still in the press business, I would have material enough to start and maintain a column on the uses and misuses of technology for at least a year.", "input": "", "output": "Wow."}, {"instruction": "Would you like to hear some?  No, never mind--I'll tell you anyway.  We got anecdotes from the tech-support people of large computer companies that sound absurd.  Except, based on our own in-house stories, I know that there's truth there!  This one network tech guy is talking to a reservation clerk at a hotel who can't log in to the network.  So the tech is trying to get him to try different log-ons, but nothing's working.  Finally, the tech asks if he's sure he's running an IBM.  The guy says, yeah--he's looking at a label that says IBM on it.  The tech doesn't understand, he figures maybe the system's totally crashed, so he's trying to get the guy to hit the ESC key, and the guy says that there isn't one.  The guy is hunting all over his keyboard, but no ESC key.  So the tech asks him to read what's on the screen.  It's a reasonable question, right? And the guy says, \"What screen?\"  Finally, it turned out that the user was trying to log in to the network on an IBM Selectric typewriter.  See what we are up against, Doctor?  But it does show that the story-based help system is a useful device in teaching new technology to people.  We got a lot of positive response.  A lot.", "input": "", "output": "That's quite a story--computer mythology in the making.  But you're not responsible for answering all this e-mail."}, {"instruction": "I'm responsible for getting it answered.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  So you were supposed to have thought about some issues we discussed last week."}, {"instruction": "You mean Richard?", "input": "", "output": "Well?"}, {"instruction": "It's much easier to talk about my work, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I can see that."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  I'll try to fill you in on the latest and greatest in the Bows family struggle.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Richard approached me--it must be almost two weeks ago, now--and he insisted that we have lunch together to try and talk things through.", "input": "", "output": "Did you agree to go?"}, {"instruction": "He looked so bad, Doctor.  He was obviously sick and in quite a bit of pain.  I just couldn't say no.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "He took me to a small but nice lunch place downtown.  He wanted me to show him the kids' pictures and tell him about them.  I felt very awkward--I didn't want Richard to have that much of personal information about me and the boys.  But he was drinking in every word I said--he couldn't get enough.", "input": "", "output": "So you told him about Grant and Roald even against your better judgment."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  And all the time there was this strange couple sitting just a table away from us.  They kept looking at me and seemed to be paying  attention to every word I said.  I got very uncomfortable and started to insist that we change our table.  And then Richard introduced the couple as his parents.  This was a set-up for them to meet the mother of their grandchildren.", "input": "", "output": "That's outrageous, Sylvia.  Richard shouldn't have..."}, {"instruction": "I agree with you, Doctor.  I got up and told him that that was an emotional blackmail that I wouldn't have any part of.  And I left.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  I think Richard went too far."}, {"instruction": "The nest day, Richard sought me out and insisted on explaining his behavior.", "input": "", "output": "Did you let him?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Why, Sylvia?  Tell Richard that if he wants something from you, then he should go to his lawyer and negotiate for it that way.  He was the one who filed the lawsuit."}, {"instruction": "He told me that he was dying, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "He said that they found more cancer and this time it was in his kidneys.", "input": "", "output": "That's not good."}, {"instruction": "Richard said that he has about five months at the most.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that."}, {"instruction": "So I couldn't refuse a dying man, Doctor.  You understand?", "input": "", "output": "Refuse what?"}, {"instruction": "Richard wants to do DNA paternity tests on Grant and Roald to establish if they are in fact his children.", "input": "", "output": "Why?  And are you letting..."}, {"instruction": "He's dying, Doctor.  This is it for him.  He told me that he just wants to know.  If I do this for him, he said that he'll drop his lawsuit and leave me alone.", "input": "", "output": "He wouldn't want to get to know his children in the few last days that he has?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, it seems to me that we are dealing with a situation where if you give in just an inch you'll lose a mile."}, {"instruction": "It's a moot point, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I don't understand."}, {"instruction": "Lloyd came in to see me last week.", "input": "", "output": "What did he want?"}, {"instruction": "He told me that he had made provisions for Richard's children.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "He said that he has established a trust of one million dollars for the benefit of Richard's children--but any child seeking to be a beneficiary has to prove that Richard is their natural father.", "input": "", "output": "A million dollars?"}, {"instruction": "One million dollars, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "That's hard to turn down, especially when I would be turning it down for my boys. That much money could guarantee the boys' independence and freedom to do as they will in life--every mother wants that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Did you tell Tom about this?"}, {"instruction": "He'll never do it.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  But you're considering it?"}, {"instruction": "How could I not?", "input": "", "output": "And Lloyd would do this simply out of the goodness of his heart, no strings attached?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Well what?"}, {"instruction": "There are certain conditions.", "input": "", "output": "Like what?"}, {"instruction": "I have to agree to do the DNA test for each of the boys.", "input": "", "output": "That makes sense.  What else?"}, {"instruction": "I have to allow Richard's parents to participate in the raising of one or both kids based on the result of the test.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I have to introduce them and give them the access to the kids that I would give to any grandparent--holidays, weekends, birthday parties, and so on.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "I think there are a few other things that I have to promise to do, but that one is the major one.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "What do you mean and?", "input": "", "output": "This is something that you need to talk to Tom about, right?"}, {"instruction": "Right.", "input": "", "output": "You are seriously considering doing this, aren't you?"}, {"instruction": "I keep trying to come up with all the reasons why I shouldn't do this.  But is that really so much to ask for such a gift?", "input": "", "output": "But you don't really need the money, Sylvia, do you?  You can provide for your own children."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But this would go a long way to...", "input": "", "output": "You said Tom wouldn't agree to it..."}, {"instruction": "Maybe he doesn't really have to know.", "input": "", "output": "You would do this behind his back?"}, {"instruction": "Well, first of all, we don't know for a fact that either Roald or Grand are Richard's.  Right?  So I was thinking that I would take it one step at a time.  If, at some point, it actually comes to making the decision...well, I can think about that then.", "input": "", "output": "So you are planning on going through with the DNA testing without telling Tom?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I was thinking of doing that.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I haven't made a decision yet, Doctor.  But this is also the last wish of dying man.  And, after all, he could be my children's father.", "input": "", "output": "Again, my advice is for you to think long and hard before taking any action.  Work out what all the ramifications are of such a decision.  Okay?"}, {"instruction": "I will, Doctor.  Look, I've got to get home.  I'll see you in two weeks?", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I'll see you then, Sylvia.  But keep me posted and remember that I'm always available if you need me."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  And yes, it's always a pleasure.  How was your Labor Day?", "input": "", "output": "Uneventful."}, {"instruction": "Too bad.  Or rather...", "input": "", "output": "How was yours?"}, {"instruction": "I think I would rather describe it as uneventful, but...", "input": "", "output": "What happened?"}, {"instruction": "I did a lot of thinking since our last session, and I've decided that the best thing would be to discretely test the boys against Richard's DNA.  If there's no match, then no harm's done.  If it turns out that one or both were fathered by Richard, then I'll talk Tom into doing the DNA testing.", "input": "", "output": "Already knowing the outcome?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But if Richard's not the father, why should I go through all this upset with Tom for nothing?  Even though you urged me to keep everything on the up and up with Tom, I think my plan minimizes the downside.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "There isn't really a but yet.", "input": "", "output": "Then what?  Why are you so..."}, {"instruction": "I'm just feeling the guilt, Doctor.  We had a Labor Day picnic in Golden Gate Park with the whole family.  Rene and her son Robert were there.  And my parents came.  Even my brother managed to show up.  It was very nice.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds nice."}, {"instruction": "Oh, and it was sunny and warm.  The boys were sitting in the grass trying to catch butterflies fluttering around them.  Idyllic.  It was the Hollywood version of family togetherness.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "My mom baked a tort.  And as I was getting ready to serve it, Tom pulled out a bottle of champagne: \"We're celebrating today!\"", "input": "", "output": "Celebrating what?"}, {"instruction": "Apparently he got the papers on Saturday that Richard dropped his paternity suit.  He was so happy and thought that he would make a big deal out of it for me and my family--they were all so concerned.  So there he was smiling and pouring champagne into crystal glasses he managed to sneak into the picnic basket.  And my mom was crying--she was so glad that that whole thing was finally over.  But I was dying inside. I knew that Richard was dropping the suit last Friday when we took the boys to get tested.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Richard and I managed to make arrangements to take the boys first thing Tuesday morning.  And then I let Richard spend the next three hours playing with the boys and just enjoying being in their company.  He was so worried about the needle pricks--I think it hurt him more to watch the doctor take a sample of the boys' blood then it did the boys.", "input": "", "output": "Who?  Richard?"}, {"instruction": "Richard.  And then he was worried that Tom would notice the marks on the boys' thighs--I had to reassure him that Tom is usually not around for bath time.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So when will you know about the results of the test?"}, {"instruction": "Not for some time--it usually takes several weeks to get the results.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But Richard told his lawyer to drop the suit as soon as we started the test.   He was so happy to see the boys.  He played with them and talked with them.  And there was a sense of...", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "I know. I know I shouldn't be thinking that way.  But they responded to Richard, too.  There was clearly something there.  And even if there wasn't, I'm glad that I gave this opportunity to Richard.  He's so sick now.  He's thin as a rail and can't go through the day with out painkillers.  I don't think he has much time left.  That seemed like such a little thing, Doctor.  Is it so bad to make a dying man happy?", "input": "", "output": "But you felt guilty when Tom announced that Richard dropped the lawsuit.  Doesn't that tell you something?  It's clear than on some level you don't think that what you did was all right."}, {"instruction": "I know--it's guilt all around. Damned if I do and damned if I don't.", "input": "", "output": "Not necessarily.  If you told Tom about everything, he would have probably gone along with your decision to test the boys and there wouldn't have been any guilt.  The guilt comes from your decision to keep things secret from Tom."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  But Tom would never have agreed to let Richard spend any time with the boys.", "input": "", "output": "And you did?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Why would you do that, Sylvia?  Why do you need this extra complication in your life?  Why risk your relationship with Tom over this?"}, {"instruction": "It's Richard.  It's just so hard to say no to him.", "input": "", "output": "You could try."}, {"instruction": "Oh Doctor.  You're making this very simplistic--just say no to Richard and say yes to happiness with Tom.  Done deal.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But life is just not that black and white.  Out of all the man I sought out to be the father for my child...children, Richard was truly the only one I really connected with on some deeper level.  There was fire in that man.  He was more than just a lover, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "But things have changed."}, {"instruction": "Yes, they have.  I'm happily married to Tom again and Richard is near death.", "input": "", "output": "But..."}, {"instruction": "If Richard sees the boys a few more times and spends a few precious meager moments in their company, is that so wrong?  He's dead, really.  It couldn't possibly make that much difference to anyone but him.  Those two or three afternoons...Tom wouldn't miss the boys.  But for Richard...it means so much to him.  Especially if either Grant or Roald turns out to be his son, how can I deny him the opportunity to look into the eyes of his only child?", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, I understand your point of view.  But you are playing a dangerous game.  Today Richard only wants a few visit with the boys, and tomorrow..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor...", "input": "", "output": "And if you feel so strongly about this, Sylvia, why aren't you talking to Tom about it?  If Tom finds out that you're making arrangements with Richard behind his back, he's not going to take it well.  Instead of all this secret meetings and manipulations, try raising the issue with Tom.  He might surprise you.  He's surprised you before."}, {"instruction": "Look, we'll know for a fact if the boys are any relation to Richard in about two weeks.  If it turns out that they are, I'll talk to Tom about all of this.  But if the tests come up negative, then all this nerve-wracking would be for nothing.  I can wait.", "input": "", "output": "And Richard?  Is he willing to wait and see the results of the blood test before he sees the boys again?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I'll make him wait.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think he would go for that?"}, {"instruction": "He doesn't have much choice, does he?", "input": "", "output": "I guess not.  You have all the cards."}, {"instruction": "God, you're making me sound so cold and calculating.  But this really is about compassion.  All he wants is a couple of lousy visits with the boys.  Richard is no threat to Tom.", "input": "", "output": "Then there is no reason not to tell him, right?"}, {"instruction": "Right.  I'll tell him when I think the time is right.", "input": "", "output": "When you know the results of the tests."}, {"instruction": "Right.  I'm going to go now, Doctor.  I'm too wound up to go straight home, and I need to be there for dinner--Richard's dad is in town.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I'll see you in two weeks."}, {"instruction": "Right.  Thank you, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Did you find out the results of the DNA test?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "And it's been hell.", "input": "", "output": "Are they Richard's?"}, {"instruction": "The test results were negative for Grant.  But there's a 99.9% chance that Roald is his child.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  So what are the implications for you and Richard?"}, {"instruction": "Richard's a lot worse.  He's been hospitalized last week.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Sylvia.  What's his prognosis?"}, {"instruction": "He's too weak to deal with chemotherapy.", "input": "", "output": "What about radiation?  Is it an option for him?"}, {"instruction": "He's just basically wants to be left alone at this point.  The treatments are making him very sick and there's not much hope anyway.  So Richard decided to stop all treatment other than analgesics.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "He might feel strong enough to get out of the hospital again or he might not.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about this?"}, {"instruction": "I hate seeing the man waste away like this.  He's so young.  He's got so much to live for.  In the last week, I got to know his parents--his mom mostly.  She's in shock.  She keeps talking about when Richard will get better; she told me that he's coming back to live with them in Virginia.  She said that she has set up his old room just as it was when he was a kid.  She kept everything--his books, his toys, his record collection, all the furniture.  God!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I look in her face and I know that we both know that this is the end.  And yet she talks about him coming home.  That's what it's like to love someone with complete abandon.  That's a mother's love.", "input": "", "output": "I sense that you're identifying with her on some level."}, {"instruction": "One should never outlive one's own children.  I never want to see my sons die.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor, I'm just horrified and completely drained by the whole situation.", "input": "", "output": "Does Tom know about any of this?"}, {"instruction": "Some.  He knows that Richard has untreatable cancer.  But it's like he's happy that Richard is going to die.  Well, maybe not happy.  But I think Tom feels that with Richard's death some of his problems will go away.  He will never have to worry about Richard surfacing with his custody suits or attempting a reconciliation with me.", "input": "", "output": "Does Tom know that you've been seeing Richard?"}, {"instruction": "No.  I don't think he would understand.  By choosing to be with Richard right now, I am not abandoning Tom and I have no desire to sever our relationship in any way.", "input": "", "output": "And you don't think that Tom would understand that?"}, {"instruction": "If he was a bit more sympathetic to Richard, I would probably tell Tom everything.  It's been really hard--trying to work and then sneak into the hospital to see Richard; sometimes to secretly bring the boys over to him; and then of course talking to Richard's parents.  What hell!", "input": "", "output": "You're sneaking the boys into the hospital?"}, {"instruction": "There's not much time left.  I'm afraid that Richard won't have an opportunity to visit with Roald for very much longer.  I try to set up excursions into the hospital's garden.  I bring a picnic and let the boys play on the lawn while Richard watches them from a wheelchair.  It's the only time that I notice him let go now--his face opens up and he almost smiles.  You know, he barely has the strength to hold Roald--he's a big boy now and very squirmy.  He tries to stand up as soon as he gets into someone's lap.  I think he's got Richard's eyes.  They both have such giant brown eyes.", "input": "", "output": "You're being very good to Richard."}, {"instruction": "I don't feel like I have much of a choice.  And you should see Richard's mom--Roald laughs and she laughs.  She gets right down into the grass with him and helps him play with grass stems and rocks.  Maybe when you get to be a grandparent you recognize your blood in your grandchildren, too.  She said that she knew Roald was Richard's son as soon as she first laid eyes on him--on his photograph, in fact.", "input": "", "output": "I believe she might have told you the same thing if she found out that Grant was Richard's son."}, {"instruction": "I know what you're saying--she reconstructed her memory to fit the events.  But I could see that she genuinely loves my boy.", "input": "", "output": "So what about the arrangements?  Are you going to tell Tom about Lloyd's offer?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  A million bucks will go a long way to soften his disposition toward Richard and his parents.", "input": "", "output": "I sense hostility in your voice."}, {"instruction": "Maybe it's more like resentment.  I wish Tom would make it easier on me to tell him about all this.  If he was just a bit more receptive...", "input": "", "output": "Have you given him a chance?"}, {"instruction": "You mean have I tried to approach him with this?", "input": "", "output": "Have you?"}, {"instruction": "I told him that Lloyd approached me with an offer, and that I told him that I wanted for both of us to be there to hear it.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you lie?  What if Lloyd gives away the fact that you already know everything?  Including the fact that Roald is Richard's son?"}, {"instruction": "I know it was stupid.  It just happened.  I was there trying to tell Tom about...more than that, I had the papers in my hand.  I was going to tell him about Lloyd's offer and ask him if he would agree to at least test the boys--we could decide what to do after we knew.  But as I started to talk...well, that was the version that came out.  So as far as Tom is concerned, I don't even know about the money.", "input": "", "output": "So you were all set to tell him one lie, but somehow another slipped out."}, {"instruction": "Something like that.", "input": "", "output": "You're getting yourself into trouble, Sylvia.  And I don't even understand why you're doing it."}, {"instruction": "It's all so complicated.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think it has to be."}, {"instruction": "Look, that's the way it is now.  We're meeting Lloyd this Friday.", "input": "", "output": "I hope it all works out."}, {"instruction": "Me, too.  I would love for all of this to come to an end.  Well, it's not what I mean.  I don't want for Richard to die.  I just want to have the freedom to do what I think is right without feeling constant guilt.", "input": "", "output": "As I said, I hope it all works out for you, Sylvia.  Are you seeing Richard before Friday?"}, {"instruction": "I'm going over there tomorrow.  Rene will bring the kids by after work and we will go to the hospital together from there.", "input": "", "output": "Rene's helping you?"}, {"instruction": "She's really the only one I could trust.  And I think she understands my motives in a way nobody else would.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "Robert's father died before he even got a chance to see him.  Neither Rene nor Robert ever got over that.  They've both been incredibly helpful.", "input": "", "output": "I remember now you telling me about Rene's husband.  I can see how she would be your perfect choice."}, {"instruction": "She's also my best friend, Doctor, even though our relationship has been strained by my getting back together with Tom.  Rene refuses to understand why I would want to be with him or how I could still love him.", "input": "", "output": "My guess is that she empathized so completely with you during your difficulties with Tom that she can't let go, even though you have."}, {"instruction": "You're probably right, Doctor.  Look, I'd better go.  I have hardly spent anytime with Tom in the last couple of weeks.  But it was really nice to be able to talk to someone openly about all of this.  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "I'm here for you, Sylvia.  Would you like to come back in two weeks or sooner?"}, {"instruction": "Better make it two weeks--no time, Doctor.  No time.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you then.  Good luck on Friday."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor.  Good night.", "input": "", "output": "Good night."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.  It's been a very hard few weeks.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry about Richard."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Did you go to the funeral?"}, {"instruction": "It was last...I mean the weekend before last, on Saturday.  I don't know, Doctor, it's still hard to think of him as gone.  I knew it was going to happen.  In fact, when I got the phone call from Richard's mom, I wasn't particularly surprised--he was so ill and so weak. But still...", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Only a few months before, I would have given anything to see him die--get killed in a car accident, plane crash, chewed up by a shark while surfing...I mean I had vivid dreams of Richard's death.  I even told Tom about them, and we would laugh at them together with Tom providing horrifically disgusting details.  But now...it's so different now, Doctor.  Now, I have dreams of Richard holding Roald in his arms in the hospital bed--his face all distorted from pain and wasted away, but eyes still shining with love for his son.  It's horrible, Doctor, I can't sleep at night.  And then this whole mess with Tom...", "input": "", "output": "What about Tom?"}, {"instruction": "I told you how difficult he was making it for me to tell him about Roald and Richard.", "input": "", "output": "It was my impression that you were not particularly interested in being very forthcoming with Tom either."}, {"instruction": "Perhaps not.  But I was watching a friend and a father of my child die a very horrible death. I was hoping that Tom would be a bit more supportive or at least open to me.  But it's all water under the bridge at this point.", "input": "", "output": "Sylvia, try to put yourself in Tom's place.  Richard might have been your friend, but he was also your lover--the father of one of your children, a man who sued you and Tom for the custody of your children, someone who purposefully tried to break you and Tom up..."}, {"instruction": "I know that there aren't a lot of good reasons why Tom should be nice or understanding about Richard, but he's dead now.", "input": "", "output": "I'm just trying to remind you that Tom is not really being unreasonable. He has a lot of good reasons not to like Richard.  And you lying to him and sneaking behind his back to see Richard just didn't help."}, {"instruction": "Oh, he knows about that--apparently my babysitter told him about our little visits to the hospital a few weeks back.", "input": "", "output": "So Tom knew all this time and didn't say anything to you?"}, {"instruction": "You see what I have to live with?  If he just confronted me, it would have been so much easier.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I love Tom, Doctor Balis, I really do.  All this Richard stuff hasn't changed how I feel about Tom.  But it's so difficult sometimes.  He is so reserved, so secretive.  I never know if he already knows what I'm telling him.  It's like living with Machiavelli.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you shouldn't try to lie to Tom."}, {"instruction": "But sometimes...", "input": "", "output": "Has it ever yielded a positive result?  Have you ever successfully deceived Tom for long?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  I find it easier sometimes to just not tell him the whole truth.  It's like I have these conversations with him in my head--I play out the scene before it happens.  And it always seems that presenting a particular version of reality would work better.", "input": "", "output": "Particular version of reality?  You mean lying?"}, {"instruction": "If you insist on calling it that.  I never actually lie, I just present information in a more favorable light.", "input": "", "output": "Right."}, {"instruction": "It doesn't matter, Doctor.  Tom knew I was seeing Richard and bringing the boys with me, and he never let on.  Then when I told him that Richard died, he took it very matter of fact--no emotion, not even \"I'm glad that son of a bitch is dead.\"  I told him that I wanted to attend the funeral, and he said that it was my decision--whatever I wanted to do was fine with him.  But the way he said it...I just don't know, Doctor.  He's locking me out again--we're not communicating.  And please don't tell me that it's all my fault, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  I won't say that."}, {"instruction": "Richard had a very nice ceremony.  A lot of people came.  I sat next to his mom; she cried the whole time.  She told me that she had a photograph of Roald next to her heart and that it was the only thing that was keeping her from losing her mind.   And then suddenly I found myself crying, too.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Sylvia."}, {"instruction": "Richard's dad came and held me close.  I felt very uncomfortable, but I couldn't pull away.  They all needed me somehow--needed a piece of me to give them a link with Richard.  When the service was over, we all drove down to the cemetery.", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "I thought I saw Tom in the parking lot of the chapel, but I wasn't sure.", "input": "", "output": "Did Tom know where the service was?"}, {"instruction": "It wouldn't have been that difficult to find out if he wanted to know.", "input": "", "output": "That's true."}, {"instruction": "Richard's parents planned to plant a redwood sapling next to Richard's grave.  They found one exactly the same age as Roald--eight months.  They asked me to help them put it in the ground.", "input": "", "output": "How nice."}, {"instruction": "When I was finally able to move a bit out of the way, I felt someone put a hand on my shoulder.  It was Tom.", "input": "", "output": "He was there the whole time, then."}, {"instruction": "He saw the whole thing.  He looked at me and asked how it felt to be Richard's widow.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It was such a cruel thing to say.  I was already so crushed, he didn't need to do that.", "input": "", "output": "Try to think how Tom must have felt at that moment."}, {"instruction": "You'd think he'd be happy.", "input": "", "output": "You don't really think that."}, {"instruction": "No.  I know he was angry and upset with me.  But there's just so much I can cope with at any one particular moment.  He could have chosen to confront me the next day.  But at the funeral?", "input": "", "output": "I agree, Tom's first priority clearly wasn't to make Richard's death easier on you."}, {"instruction": "And the final straw was Lloyd.", "input": "", "output": "Oh.  I guess Lloyd would have gone to the funeral."}, {"instruction": "He was there for the services, too.  But he came over right then--just as Tom accused me of playing the role of Richard's widow.", "input": "", "output": "What did he want?"}, {"instruction": "He congratulated Tom on the million dollar trust that Roald just inherited.", "input": "", "output": "Lloyd chooses his moments well."}, {"instruction": "Bastard!  He must have watched us and timed it just so.", "input": "", "output": "Did Tom know about Roald testing positive for Richard's paternity?"}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.  I'm not sure.  He didn't act surprised, but...", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Tom was actually very gracious to Lloyd.  I wanted to tear Lloyd apart.  He was playing us like violins, trying to torture us to evoke all the subtle nuances of emotion.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "He could see I was physically and emotionally disintegrating right there before his eyes.  He was playing a game and watching me fall apart was his prize.  Thank god for Tom.", "input": "", "output": "What did Tom do?"}, {"instruction": "He was just super smooth.  Tom said that it had been a trying day and maneuvered me out of there.  Lloyd was obviously disappointed that he didn't get to wring me out a bit more.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Then Tom took me and drove me home.  It's funny.", "input": "", "output": "What's that?"}, {"instruction": "In some way, Lloyd did me a favor by being such an asshole.  It's like he managed to direct Tom's anger away from me.  But I still feel like I got Lloyded.", "input": "", "output": "Lloyded?"}, {"instruction": "You know, like Steved.", "input": "", "output": "What are you talking about?"}, {"instruction": "Steve Jobs of Apple?  Everyone in the valley is talking about programs and people that Apple cut--they say they've been Steved.  I've been Lloyded.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  How are you and Tom now?"}, {"instruction": "Things are very strained.  I showed him the deal with Lloyd and Richard--to get the million dollar trust, Richard's parents must have grandparent-like visitation rights to Roald.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "We're still trying to work things out.  But Richard's mom has been calling me several times a day for the last week hoping to arrange to see Roald.", "input": "", "output": "How does Tom feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "He hasn't said no.  He told me that he needs time and space to work through his own feelings right now.", "input": "", "output": "That sounds fair."}, {"instruction": "I agree.  But I feel like he's testing me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "He knows just how great the temptation is for me to let Richard's parents see Roald, and he's watching, waiting, and testing me.", "input": "", "output": "I think you might be over suspicious of Tom and attributing to him emotions and motivations that just aren't there."}, {"instruction": "I don't think so.  But I'll do what he wants--I won't let them be with Roald until Tom's ready.  I better go now, Doctor.  It's getting late.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Sylvia.  But..."}, {"instruction": "I won't damage my relationship with Tom any further.  You don't have to caution me, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "What I was going to say was that you should try to keep an open mind regarding Tom.  Don't just assume from the start that his main purpose is to try and push you down.  Tom's surprised you before.  I think Tom has quite a number of issues that he has to work out, and you shouldn't be resentful of him for that.  Do you understand me, Sylvia?"}, {"instruction": "I do.  I got to go, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Shall we set up our next appointment?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, I would rather call you about that.  I just feel so pressed for time right now.  I don't want to commit to more than I can handle.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay.  But please keep me informed on what's going on with you, and you can use me to help you reduce and resolve some of your frustrations and resentments."}, {"instruction": "I know, Doctor.  Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Sylvia."}]
