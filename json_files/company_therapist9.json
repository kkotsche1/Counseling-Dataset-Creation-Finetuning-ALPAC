[{"instruction": "Eliza Raven. Hello Dr. Balis. I'm glad to make your acquaintance.", "input": "", "output": "And I am glad to make yours. Will you please have a seat?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "I got a message from some man that you wanted to see me, but he wasn't very specific.  So what would you like to talk about, Ms. Raven?"}, {"instruction": "Please call me Eliza, or Liz if you prefer. I can talk about anything you wish.", "input": "", "output": "Okay Eliza, why don't we start with why you're here?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, well Luke called in the appointment. He said it was high time for me to see someone who can tell me what is wrong with me.", "input": "", "output": "And Luke is...?"}, {"instruction": "Luke's my fianc\u00e9.  I didn't mean that I didn't want to come too.  I wanted to. I've wanted to for a very long time. I just...couldn't get up the nerve to call.", "input": "", "output": "You were nervous about calling me?"}, {"instruction": "This is really embarrassing.", "input": "", "output": "We can switch subjects if you like."}, {"instruction": "No, no, no. I'll talk. I guess I've always had this fear of calling someone for the first time. Like in high school, boys would give me their number, but I could never get up the nerve to call them. So I just gave them my number the next day and waited for them to call me. If they called me, then I could call them back. It's like that with the phone company, and other places that I owe money to. I just can't get up the nerve to call and make arrangements if I am going to be late on a payment. It's just so frustrating!", "input": "", "output": "I can see how that would be frustrating. Here's some tissue if you need it."}, {"instruction": "No, no, no. I'll be okay. I just need to catch my breath.", "input": "", "output": "We can wait until you're ready."}, {"instruction": "Okay, now I feel stupid. God! I am so stupid. It's not fair! Nobody else ever feels like this.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I know a lot of people who are apprehensive about calling people they don't know on the telephone. You don't need to feel stupid."}, {"instruction": "Thanks for being so nice to me and I appreciate your sympathy. But I just can't believe that you personally know anyone like me. I'm so screwed up.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to get to the root of those feelings."}, {"instruction": "I don't know where the root is.", "input": "", "output": "We'll work together to get there, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. So you are on my side?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Good. I feel so much better knowing that. I figured we'd end up talking about my mother; I never figured that I would disclose one of my biggest secrets.", "input": "", "output": "Your apprehension on the telephone is a secret?  Does your family know about it?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. It's a very big secret. My family knows, and my fianc\u00e9 Luke of course, but no one else. Luke doesn't understand it though. He gets very frustrated with me when I can't call someone. I get scared and he just makes it worse. He's not very sympathetic about it. Usually, he'll tell me I have to call someone, and then I'll start to get all panicky. And then he'll give me the \"It's part of being an adult so why don't you grow up\" speech. Usually I'll break down in tears and he'll just scowl at me and then make the call for me. Or I'll dial the number and then hang up when I get a voice on the line.", "input": "", "output": "This sounds like a real problem for you. And your fianc\u00e9 sounds like he's not very patient with you."}, {"instruction": "Oh no. Luke is an absolute angel. I love him so much. He's the kindest, gentlest, sweetest man I've ever known, next to my daddy. He's just trying to get me out of the old habits that restrict me. I don't think he's a very good teacher though. He's the \"dive right in\" sort, and it takes me awhile to build up the steam for it. It takes a lot of energy to try something new. But Luke is always concerned about me and how I feel. That's why he called in to make an appointment for me. He's such a dear.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you care for him very much."}, {"instruction": "He's the only man I've ever loved, next to Daddy.", "input": "", "output": "You're close to your father?"}, {"instruction": "Daddy is such a neat guy!  I wish he'd find someone, though. I can't stand to see him lonely. Right now my brother Isaac is staying with him, but Daddy needs a lady around.", "input": "", "output": "And your mother?"}, {"instruction": "Oh well, Mother remarried a couple years ago. She's happy. I'm glad for her.", "input": "", "output": "You don't sound very glad."}, {"instruction": "There are a lot of things about Mother that I don't feel glad about.", "input": "", "output": "How long have your parents been separated?"}, {"instruction": "About ten years.", "input": "", "output": "They separated when you were...."}, {"instruction": "Ten.", "input": "", "output": "Would you like to talk about that?"}, {"instruction": "Sure, why the hell not? I'm going to be telling you every fucking thing else!", "input": "", "output": "If this upsets you, we can talk about something else for now."}, {"instruction": "No, no, no. It's okay. I just really hate the way they split up. I'm extremely bitter about it.", "input": "", "output": "That's to be expected."}, {"instruction": "I know. It's just that...well, why did she have to be such a bitch about it? She was so cruel to Daddy. She took everything that was important to him.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I don't know where to start. The beginning? Before they got married, Mom and Dad dated in high school. She was going to get a scholarship to an art school. Dad was a talented musician and actor and was well on his way to Juilliard. On their graduation night, Daddy proposed. Mom was the happiest woman on the planet. They were married two months later. Her parents were very wealthy.  They liked Daddy and they paid for the whole thing. They pulled favors, and spent a lot of money on the wedding. I have one of Mom and Dad's wedding pictures in my wallet. Here.", "input": "", "output": "They look..."}, {"instruction": "Uncomfortable, I know. Mom and Dad wanted a very small wedding. Her parents would hear nothing of it. Ultimately, Mom and Dad eloped before the wedding, and had their own personal ceremony. Then they pretended not to be married for the week before the wedding.  When they said their vows in front of all her parents' guests, they'd actually already been married a week.", "input": "", "output": "That was rather brave of them."}, {"instruction": "Oh yes! It's rather romantic and dreamy. It wasn't going to last anyhow. A year later, they had Isaac--my grandparents named him. And nine months after Isaac, I was conceived. At first, Momma was happy that she could be a good mother and wife. But Daddy was unhappy. He had to refuse offers from Juilliard and other places so that he could get a real job and support his wife and children. But Dad made the sacrifice out of love. He never rubbed it in. He just approached it with love and maturity. And, like I said, Mom was happy at first. My earliest memory is of Mom and Dad sitting on the couch together and smiling. Everything was fine until I turned seven. Mom missed my birthday. She had an interview and completely forgot. Daddy made the cake and he and Isaac celebrated with me. I was crushed. Mom came home very late that night and I heard Daddy and Mother start to fight. I had never heard them argue before, so I scampered out of my bedroom. I pushed the door to their room open and saw Mother hitting Daddy. I screamed.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "And then...and then...she grabbed my arm and led me back to my room. And she...she turned me over her knee and gave me a spanking. And she yelled at me and told me never to go in there again. I mean, how was I supposed to know? It was a new sound and it scared me. I never forgave her for that. I just remember crying, \"Why Momma why?\"", "input": "", "output": "I can imagine that it was a traumatic experience."}, {"instruction": "Here I am thirteen years later, sobbing on a therapist's couch. How horrid.", "input": "", "output": "There's no reason to be ashamed of childhood traumas having an effect in our adult lives.  That's how we're built as human beings."}, {"instruction": "Oh I know. It's just weird for me.", "input": "", "output": "What happened after the spanking?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it just got worse after that day. Momma kicked Daddy out of the bedroom and he started sleeping on the couch. She started spending more and more time away. Isaac and I were left to take care of each other. Then, when I was nine, Momma left for good. She just didn't come home one day.", "input": "", "output": "What then?"}, {"instruction": "It was so good! Daddy made sure we were taken care of, and he started going to night school. He always spent weekends with us, we did family things, and what with Mother not being around, we could laugh again. So much tension was dispersed. Isaac and I picked up the things Mother used to do and pretty well took care of each other. Until Mother came back.", "input": "", "output": "Did your father ever instigate a search for your mother?"}, {"instruction": "What, do you think he was a heartless bastard? Of course he did! No leads, nothing. She just disappeared. We all knew she was alive and well, but we did have a little farewell ceremony for her. We each took something that we felt represented her and drove out to the countryside. Daddy brought a little sketch that she had drawn for him. Isaac brought one of his old baby bottles. I brought a hat pin.", "input": "", "output": "A hat pin?"}, {"instruction": "She had this big floppy straw hat; she always wore her hair up. She would keep the hat secure on her head with this big old fashioned Victorian hat pin. It was about a foot long with this big faceted crystal bead on the non-pointy end. It also had little tassels around the bead; they were made of little strings of pretty garnet and amethyst beads. It was her great grandmother's. She was going to give it to me when I was old enough, but I knew deep down that there was no way she'd ever part with it willingly. So we each brought these things with us to the country. Daddy found this place: there was a willow tree with its branches dipping into the little river nearby. So Daddy placed all of our items into a box and dug a really deep hole. He placed the box in the hole and covered it up. Then he had each of us explain why we chose the items that we brought, and each of us said a little prayer for her. Daddy cried a lot that day.  Mother eventually did come back, but not for a year.", "input": "", "output": "I think we covered a lot of important ground during this first session.  I would like to see you again and continue exploring these feelings if you'd like."}, {"instruction": "I think I would like that.", "input": "", "output": "Well, then how about next week at this same time?"}, {"instruction": "Certainly, I will be here. And thank you so much.", "input": "", "output": "You are quite welcome. And Ms. Raven?"}, {"instruction": "Yes?", "input": "", "output": "It might be helpful if you would consider keeping a journal of your thoughts and feelings, or saving your doodles and sketches for me to look at. I don't need to read your journal if you don't want me too, but I would like to if you'd let me.  I've found a journal to be a valuable tool for my patients to try to clarify their feelings."}, {"instruction": "Well okay. I can try.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you next week then.  That's Tuesday, February 18th at noon."}, {"instruction": "That's fine.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Good afternoon Dr. Balis. I hope you received my letter?", "input": "", "output": "Yes I did."}, {"instruction": "Very good. Well, here is the list Luke provided me. I hope that you don't wish to stick to it, because I surely do not.", "input": "", "output": "Let's see: \"The Weather, Sports, Work, Music and your band, the News, Animals, and your Wedding Plans.\"  I don't know, I think I might like discussing the weather."}, {"instruction": "Good heavens Doctor! You're not serious!", "input": "", "output": "No I'm not. Why don't we forget about Luke's list right now and just talk about what you want to talk about."}, {"instruction": "First off, let's not discuss my childhood right now. I find that it's rather boring and dreary. This is not just Luke's orders; it's my wish not to speak of it. I'd rather work backward, if that's okay with you.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine. You mentioned that you are subject to crying spells in your letter."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I have them quite frequently. In fact, more frequently than I would like.", "input": "", "output": "Is there anything in particular that triggers them?"}, {"instruction": "It's usually something or other. Like the other day, I came home from work and started reflecting about my day. I remembered our session and it made me a little sad about my poor relationship with my mother. Well, Luke walks in from work. He asks me how my day was and I told him I was feeling a bit shaky about seeing you for the first time, but that it was nothing to worry about. He asked me what we talked about,and I told him nothing in particular. Well Luke knows me better than that and he started to grill me about it. Before I know it, I'm sobbing about having to talk about Mother and he goes off. He was ranting and raving and swearing and cursing. It was horrible. Before I knew it, he was hopping in his car and speeding off to your office to have a word with you. Apparently, you had already left for the day and so he came back home. He said his work with you was far from finished.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm..."}, {"instruction": "Well, that's how one of the episodes started. Others are brought on by nervousness, stress, anger. It's actually quite a release. It's my way of coping with the big bad world out there.", "input": "", "output": "How often do you have these episodes?"}, {"instruction": "The minimum is once a week. The maximum is twice a day.", "input": "", "output": "When did you start having them?"}, {"instruction": "About two years now. Not a day goes by when I'm not thinking whether I'm going to have another one.  I worry about how long it will last and whether I'll have enough kerchiefs for my nosebleeds.", "input": "", "output": "Your crying sessions are accompanied by nosebleeds?"}, {"instruction": "Almost always.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me something. How do you feel about Luke?"}, {"instruction": "I love him. With all of my heart and soul. It's like I'm in a fantasy land, and it's just me and him. He's chivalrous, beautiful, wonderful. Any woman would be glad to have him around. I'm a lucky woman.", "input": "", "output": "Does Luke always stand up for you?"}, {"instruction": "An example?", "input": "", "output": "His phone call to me, for example."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I knew it! You are upset about that phone call! I begged him not to...I pleaded! I was on my hands and knees, for Christ's sake! He is extremely overprotective of me and anything that upsets me upsets him as well. He did it to vent his aggression, not to defend me! I wanted to talk about Mother, I swear! Oh please believe me!", "input": "", "output": "Of course I believe you.  I'm sorry Eliza, I didn't mean to upset you. Here're the tissues."}, {"instruction": "I don't need them, thank you. I think I might want to go home now.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that would help you with your problems."}, {"instruction": "I don't know! I just can't make up my own mind!", "input": "", "output": "Eliza..."}, {"instruction": "Do you want me to stay? Well do you?!", "input": "", "output": "Eliza, I..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, you do not wish it! I knew it, I knew it, I knew it! Nobody wants me around, not even my own therapist!", "input": "", "output": "Eliza!"}, {"instruction": "Yes, good Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Please calm down. Let's work this through."}, {"instruction": "All right. I will stay then. But only because you want me to. Blast these nosebleeds!", "input": "", "output": "It is my desire to help you work through your problems, not to make up your mind for you."}, {"instruction": "Then your're the only one who will let me make up my own mind.", "input": "", "output": "Is that really true, Eliza?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Who else makes your decisions?"}, {"instruction": "Everyone! My Mother, Luke, his Mother, Isaac, Camille, Josie, Robin, Anders, my co-workers, my bosses, Luke's extended family, my extended family, Everyone I know makes up my mind for me!", "input": "", "output": "I noticed that you didn't mention your father."}, {"instruction": "Even he does it sometimes! \"Oh dear, you're not strong enough to make a decision on that.\" He can piss off, and so can the rest of them! They make me so angry! I hate them, I hate them, I hate them!", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever tried to stand up for yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. A couple times. It didn't go over well.", "input": "", "output": "What about Luke's father?"}, {"instruction": "Dead. Car accident. Two years ago. He was driving home from one of my band's gigs and he was a little bit drunk. Head-on collision. I was lucky I was thrown from the car.", "input": "", "output": "You were in that accident?"}, {"instruction": "I do not want to talk about it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Let's go back to what happened when you tried to stand up for yourself."}, {"instruction": "It happened so fast...", "input": "", "output": "Pardon?"}, {"instruction": "I am sorry, I was a bit distracted. I was saying that the accident happened so fast. The last thing I heard was him scream and then I was soaring and I skidded on my face...", "input": "", "output": "Ow."}, {"instruction": "Yeah it did hurt. I remembered waking up in a hospital room and Luke standing over me, tears streaking down his face. I was so touched. I'd never seen him cry.", "input": "", "output": "You were surprised to see him crying?"}, {"instruction": "Well c'mon. Wouldn't you be surprised to see a former athlete crying his eyes out?", "input": "", "output": "I guess I could be."}, {"instruction": "Well he was crying, saying over and over, \"He's dead, dead Liz, dead. He's dead Liz. He's dead.\"", "input": "", "output": "His father?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I was out for a week. His father died and so did the baby I was carrying.", "input": "", "output": "You were pregnant?"}, {"instruction": "It was really too soon for me to tell. My periods have always been at odd intervals, so two months without one was no big deal for me.", "input": "", "output": "Does Luke know that you miscarried in the accident?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I talked with my doctor after I came out of my coma, and asked him what happened. He told me that I had miscarried in the accident. I felt it was my duty that Luke should know--he's so family oriented. I had to tell him; I couldn't get away with not telling him. It took me a week to work up the courage.", "input": "", "output": "How did that talk go?"}, {"instruction": "Not well at all. At first he laughed and said that it was a morbid attempt to try to cheer him up after his father had died. I kept insisting that there was no way I was lying and I got so emotionally worked up, that he finally believed me.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "All hell broke loose. He had a complete and total cow, if you don't mind me saying. Suddenly it was my fault that his father had died, and it was my intention to miscarry the baby. It was all my fault! All mine!", "input": "", "output": "You weren't driving.  How could it have been your fault?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, try telling that to Luke. Eventually, after the breakdowns started, he stopped and laid off me. He can't stand to see me cry or in pain in any way. So I guess that resolves that.", "input": "", "output": "Are you taking medication for the accident?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I have to take painkillers for all sorts of things--Percocets. I was thrown face first. They had to do reconstructive surgery. They did a damned good job, no scars whatsoever. Well a few but, you know, not any noticeable ones. I broke both arms, a leg, and I got a concussion. I almost scraped all the flesh off my arms during that skid. After Luke told me that his father had died, I was in a coma for a week. I was in the hospital longer. Multiple fractions. Reconstructive surgery. Physical therapy. Pain, pain, pain. All the time. I couldn't write for awhile. Luke bought me a mini-cassette recorder for that. I put it in my lap top when I could type again. But it was a long time before I healed from that. And I have yet to begin healing emotionally. I have a recurring nightmare about it.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me about that."}, {"instruction": "Well, in my dream I'm sitting in Gary's car--Gary was Luke's father--and I'm holding a baby in my lap. We're rolling along at a slow pace when suddenly I grab the wheel and swing one leg over the console and press the gas. We are careening toward another car, when I fling myself out the door, leaving Gary in the car. I take the baby with me. So I roll away. I look up in time to see the cars crash. And I start laughing hysterically. The baby starts to cry, and I begin to tear it apart, limb by limb. It's a little girl. Then I begin to walk away, still laughing. But then I turn around and Gary's pulling himself out of the wreckage. He starts to chase me, even though he's all mangled and everything. He's like a zombie, like \"Thriller\" and I start to scream. But then the baby pulls itself together and starts to toddle after me, zombie fashion. I turn around and run and run and run. They get closer. I feel Gary scrape the flesh on my arms. The baby manages to get my face. They corner me and close in, their rotting, putrid faces grinning and cackling. Then I wake up.", "input": "", "output": "How often do you have this dream?"}, {"instruction": "Oh about every two months. I wake up screaming.", "input": "", "output": "What do you think the dream means?"}, {"instruction": "I think it is me internalizing the guilt that I have about the wreck. They didn't know what the gender of the baby was, but I know, deep down inside somewhere, that it was a little girl. And I could have taken the keys from Gary but I didn't have the guts to. Besides, he had driven home tipsy before, so this time was really nothing different. I would have named her Callista Dominique.", "input": "", "output": "Do mind if we discuss this some more in our next session?"}, {"instruction": "We certainly can, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. How about this same time next Tuesday.  That'll be the 25th of February at noon."}, {"instruction": "That sounds fine. I'll see you then.", "input": "", "output": "Take care Eliza. Oh, and Eliza?"}, {"instruction": "Yes?", "input": "", "output": "Feel free to call me any time you need me, okay? I'm just a phone call away."}, {"instruction": "Very well then. I'm going to go commune with the trees now.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Bye bye Dr. Balis. And thank you.", "input": "", "output": "You're quite welcome."}, {"instruction": "Good afternoon, dear Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "How are you today?"}, {"instruction": "Luke? What are you doing here?", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Raven?"}, {"instruction": "I just wanted to apologize for my conduct on the phone the other day. I was terribly out of line.", "input": "", "output": "You didn't have to do that, Mr. Howard."}, {"instruction": "Yes I did. I just have never had a girl that loves me as much as Lizzy here does, and I got carried away.", "input": "", "output": "Apology accepted, Mr. Howard. Well um... Do either of you have anything special you want to talk about while you are both here?"}, {"instruction": "Actually yes Dr. Balis. I need you to help me convince Lizzy to go to church.", "input": "", "output": "Pardon?"}, {"instruction": "I do not think. I know.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm, Wicca.  Can you tell me some more about it?"}, {"instruction": "As a Wiccan, or witch, I believe in a God and a Goddess. My religion is derived from the old world pagan religions. You know, like Mother Earth and Father Sky.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds similar to Native American religious beliefs."}, {"instruction": "Dr. Balis, this is all a phase she's going through and she really needs help to get her out of it. I mean, once she goes too far, she'll never come back.", "input": "", "output": "How do you think she's going too far?"}, {"instruction": "She burns candles for everything! She's always mumbling or chanting something, and her meditation cuts into the time we could be spending together. If she wants to be spiritual, she could come to mass with me on Sunday, but she has to be so belligerent about it!", "input": "", "output": "I don't think I understand..."}, {"instruction": "What's there not to understand about it! She's practicing a mild form of Satanism right in my mother's home!", "input": "", "output": "The two of you are living at your mother's home?"}, {"instruction": "That's not fair Luke! That's not fair at all! Go home!  Go home! Go home! Go home!", "input": "", "output": "Here.  Take this to staunch the blood."}, {"instruction": "Fine, I'm leaving. I'll talk to you later. Thank you, Dr. Balis. I hope you can sway her mind. I obviously can't.", "input": "", "output": "Eliza?"}, {"instruction": "Oh God. Oh God.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay to take a few minutes.  Just put your head back like this and hold the tissue up.  There.  I think the bleedings almost stopped now.  I'm sorry about that Eliza."}, {"instruction": "No, no, no. It's not your fault. It's mine.", "input": "", "output": "It's not your fault. Apparently he surprised you by coming today?"}, {"instruction": "We talked about it once and I told him that I would be going alone. He told me that he was going to come with me to this session and I said no. We had a explosive argument, and when he calmed down, he said that he would let me go alone if that was my wish. I said it was. He must not have listened.", "input": "", "output": "Is he abusive towards you, Eliza?"}, {"instruction": "Like what do you mean?", "input": "", "output": "\"You shut your mouth right now.\""}, {"instruction": "He was angry.", "input": "", "output": "That's true. Does he always talk to you like that when he's angry?"}, {"instruction": "Only when he's mad.", "input": "", "output": "How often does he get like that?"}, {"instruction": "When I've been acting badly, he gets angry with me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you were acting badly just now?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.  He thought I was.", "input": "", "output": "Has he ever hit you?"}, {"instruction": "No never. Never never never never.", "input": "", "output": "Please don't cry again. We're just talking. Are you going to be all right?"}, {"instruction": "I'll be fine...You're thinking I should leave him, aren't you?", "input": "", "output": "Do you want to leave him?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes...I don't know. He's not always like that.", "input": "", "output": "He seems like a very excitable person."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I guess that's the best way to describe him. His intentions are pure, but...oh. He can drive me crazy because he's so up and at 'em.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm..."}, {"instruction": "Well. He doesn't beat me and he is very kind. But it can be frustrating living with him because he's so conventional.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But you don't think I should leave?", "input": "", "output": "It's not important what I think.  What you think is what's important."}, {"instruction": "I suppose it is.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry Eliza, but we are out of time here."}, {"instruction": "Yes. I better go home and try to fix things there.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to see you next week if you can make it."}, {"instruction": "That would be fine.", "input": "", "output": "Let's make it this same time on Tuesday, that's Tuesday, March 4th at noon, okay?"}, {"instruction": "I'll see you then, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Eliza, if there is ever a problem, call me.  Day or night, my service can get a hold of me."}, {"instruction": "Thank you for your concern, Doctor. I'll call you if I'm in trouble.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you Eliza.  I'm there if you need me.  Otherwise, I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Fare thee well, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Blessed be, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "You know about Wicca?", "input": "", "output": "Just a little, Eliza.  Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Afternoon, Doctor. Sorry I'm late.", "input": "", "output": "Eliza? Is everything all right?"}, {"instruction": "It's been a really draining week.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry to hear that. Here, take a seat. You look exhausted."}, {"instruction": "I am. Last week, when I went home to apologize to Luke, he had calmed down a lot and we worked things out. He won't be dropping in for any more surprise visits. I'm glad.", "input": "", "output": "But?"}, {"instruction": "But he made me promise to go to church with him at least once.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I went Sunday and hated every bit of it.", "input": "", "output": "Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "By the end of Mass, everyone knew I was a \"confirmed Satanist.\"  They were all trying to convert me back or burn me. The bad part was that Luke was egging them on. I have never been more humiliated. The priest even wanted to do an exorcism. I was mortified.", "input": "", "output": "So much for interfaith toleration.  Did they harm you in any way?"}, {"instruction": "Not physically, but the phone hasn't stopped ringing with people wanting to talk to \"that poor girl at Mass on Sunday.\" It's taken everything in me to stand behind my beliefs. I've never explained Wicca to so many people before in my life. Luke has been apologizing daily for making me go, but I have yet to really say anything profound or meaningful to him. I spent Sunday night at Daddy's place and Luke called almost every half-hour to apologize. He's been sleeping on the couch every night since.", "input": "", "output": "You decided on that sleeping arrangement?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Monday night I locked him out of the bedroom. I guess I did. He told me he spent Sunday night on the couch too, because he couldn't face the bed alone.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it sounds like you've had an interesting week."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor. I'm about to fall apart though. Oh, another terribly exciting thing that happened was that Daddy got engaged on Thursday. Isaac called Mother and told her. So Mother took me out for a nice little evening of shopping and grilling. She wanted to know all about Calypso, the lady Daddy is going to marry.", "input": "", "output": "You never mentioned that your father was seeing anyone."}, {"instruction": "Calypso's been an on again, off again relationship. Daddy just realized that he loved her and finally proposed.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Well it doesn't sound like you had a very fun evening with your mother."}, {"instruction": "Oh, hell no. First of all, she wanted me to buy this perfectly hideous pink chiffon thing, and then a pink Angora sweater, and then some pink patent leather Mary Janes. I mean...what? Is she trying to make up for lost time? Bitch.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Anyhow, then she starts asking me all these questions:  \"What is this girl like? What does she do? Is she pretty? Do you like her?\" which basically translates into \"Is she more interesting than me? Does her job pay more than mine? Is she better looking than me?  Do you like her better than me?\" Truth be told, Calypso kicks Mother's ass in general. She gorgeous, interesting, fun, smart, creative.  Everything that Daddy needs in a lady, Calypso's got. However, Mother was mortified to find out that she's black.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Hilarious, isn't it? Well, these session are making me much stronger, Doctor, and I told her that if she wanted to know so much about my father's fianc\u00e9e, here was her number and she could goddamned well call her herself!", "input": "", "output": "Rather bold words."}, {"instruction": "Well, I got fucking sick of it. What business is it of hers? She left him in the cold and took everything important to him.  She doesn't want him, but no one else can have him either. Bitch. God, I hate her so much.", "input": "", "output": "Do you mean that?"}, {"instruction": "What? That I hate her?", "input": "", "output": "Well, yes. Do you hate her?"}, {"instruction": "I have a lot of anger in my system that belongs to her.", "input": "", "output": "Well, there's a starting point for us. I would really like to get that out of your system."}, {"instruction": "Me too. I know I'm not supposed to hate my Mother, but whatever I feel sure feels similar to it.", "input": "", "output": "I believe that it's okay to feel whatever you're going to feel.  The important thing is to figure out why you feel that way and to learn to live with the consequences of that feeling.  But that's something I'd like to save for next week. Can we move to another issue?"}, {"instruction": "I'm game.", "input": "", "output": "I've really been thinking about prescribing some medication for you that might help control the crying episodes you've experienced."}, {"instruction": "More drugs?", "input": "", "output": "It's completely your decision, Eliza.  I'm not going to try to force you into it.  But I've seen many patients who find their emotions overwhelm them benefit from some form of anti-depressant."}, {"instruction": "I'm on so many drugs already. Take this in the morning, take this with lunch, take this with your afternoon snack, take this at dinner, take this before you go to bed, and make sure you take these once a day at the same time, and don't skip any! Shit. You want me on more drugs?", "input": "", "output": "This is different from a Percocet.  It shouldn't make you feel drugged at all, just happier."}, {"instruction": "If you feel it'll help, let's try it. You know what I'm on. Anything that would make life nasty for me is a no-no. Otherwise, let's go for it. I doubt it could hurt anything further.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to have a conversation with your pain management specialist before I make my prescription.  I know you are taking Percocet, but you said there were other drugs?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, it changes all the time.", "input": "", "output": "He'll know what medications you're on.  I'll talk with him before our next session."}, {"instruction": "Sounds good. You know what?", "input": "", "output": "What is that, Eliza?"}, {"instruction": "I really look up to you. You're like what Daddy might have been if he went into psychiatry.", "input": "", "output": "Well, thank you."}, {"instruction": "You're quite welcome.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to see you next week.  That's Tuesday, March 11th at noon. Is that okay?"}, {"instruction": "That's fine. I'd better go now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Eliza. I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry about being late. I'll be on time next week.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you. Goodbye, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Dr. Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Eliza? Hello. You missed our appointment last week."}, {"instruction": "I know, I know. It was a terrible week. I was bogged down at work, there was a threat that I might lose my job, shit like that. But now I'm all caught up, so things are better.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that's good. How is Luke?"}, {"instruction": "I started talking to him again on Wednesday. He came to me and begged me to speak to him again, and he cried. I ignored him until he finished crying, and then I told him that next time he wouldn't get off so easily.", "input": "", "output": "How was the rest of your week, aside from work and Luke?"}, {"instruction": "I never got to tell you about this experience I had on the astral plane. It was amazing--the best I've had in a long time. Here, I wrote it down. Do you mind if I read it out loud?", "input": "", "output": "Go right ahead."}, {"instruction": "Okay.  Purples, greens, setting sun. I am the Raven, circling the high skies and soaring on black wing. Below I spot the lone traveler. Upon closer inspection, after I spiral down out of the sky, it is a man, shimmering and beautiful. He looks at me with curiosity filling his shimmering eyes. Cock my head to one side, and hear his heart beating far away in a body that sleeps. He begins to speak, but a feather to his lips, soft and damp, silences him and I think to him: \"Follow.\" Confused, he wants to speak again, but I spiral back up into the frothy clouds. He looks up and searches the sky for me. I fly above and go North. North is the direction for the earth. He starts to chase and I fly low to the ground. Maybe once he tries to catch me, but I jet ahead, mocking his movements. It is a running dance, forever to the North, that we partake in. He is running low on breath. I can sense that he has traveled too far from his dormant body. I spiral the ground, faster and faster, until my bird body catches fire. And as the spiral of fire dances, my form comes out of my ashes, and I have shape-shifted back into my humanoid form. He suddenly stops, as he has caught up, and he pants like a maddened lupine. His hands rest on his knees, and his body is doubled over. I cup his chin in my long hand and he looks into my eyes, instantly afraid and yet courageous. He wants me to stay. He tries to grab my hand and pull me back, but his hand passes through my ethereal body, and he calls out to me. It is too late, for I am once again in the atmosphere, reeling above. I call out once, in Raven's voice, and he waves my farewell. Then I awaken, knowing myself changed and yet the same.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Do you always write down your experiences?"}, {"instruction": "Only the ones that seem to make a difference. You should have seen this guy! He was amazing. I wish I knew who he was.", "input": "", "output": "Are you certain that this was an astral experience and not a dream?"}, {"instruction": "Please, Dr. Balis. I know the difference. I sleep at night. This happened on my lunch hour. I meditate and sometimes go astral on my lunch hour. I'm very adept at what I do. Silly man.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't mean to offend."}, {"instruction": "No offense taken, Doctor. I don't think that I will ever be able to find that guy again, but I'd like to try. He was beautiful. I'm just afraid Luke will find out about my mini-affair, and get upset with me. I don't need him mad at me again. Hey, guess what else?", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "My crying spells have started to taper off a little. I have them maybe every other day now, on average, as opposed to every day.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that."}, {"instruction": "But I don't know how long they will be like that. I hope they go away completely.", "input": "", "output": "Well, we can work on that. I spoke with your doctor, and he said that we could start you on the Zoloft."}, {"instruction": "I still don't know, Doctor. Did you speak with my gynecologist? I don't need anything that will interfere with my birth control. I know that you know, now, that it won't interfere with the Percocets, but what about my birth control? Here, this is what I'm taking.", "input": "", "output": "Triphasil 28.  Okay, I'll take a look at it, and see what we can work out.  But I don't think there is going to be any drug interactions with your birth control pills."}, {"instruction": "Sounds like a plan, Doctor. Should we talk about Mother? I know you said something in our last session about wanting to talk more about her.", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Well, what exactly would you like to know?", "input": "", "output": "Why do you feel anger regarding your mother?"}, {"instruction": "Please, Doctor. I thought you were a little more observant than that. I've already told you what she did to me and my brother when we were little. And my Daddy. I can't think of a better reason to be angry with a person.", "input": "", "output": "How did your father react to your mother leaving?"}, {"instruction": "He denied it, at first. \"She'll be back soon.\" He said that every day. I kept telling him that it wasn't so, but he was delusional. After he got over denying it, he pretended she was dead.", "input": "", "output": "How did your brother take it?"}, {"instruction": "He mourned for her. Nobody was angry but me.", "input": "", "output": "How angry were you?"}, {"instruction": "I only saw red when it came to my mother. I hated her for a long, long time. It's only recently come to the point where I can be in the same room with her without thinking about killing her.", "input": "", "output": "And your brother and father mourned for her?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. The more angry I got, the more tearful they were.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I almost hated them for awhile, too. It was like they had never gotten over the initial shock of her leaving, and I had, and all I had left was anger, or maybe anger that they passed on to me.", "input": "", "output": "So you think that you were feeling their anger for them?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I guess you could put it that way.", "input": "", "output": "Why did you take that on yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I guess I was the Mommy after she left. I was the caretaker. And Mother had done that with us. If someone had picked on us, she took care of that person. We never really got to work it out for ourselves. So I took on her role, I think. Does that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, that makes sense, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Do you think that I'm still carrying around their anger and mine?", "input": "", "output": "Do you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't want it!", "input": "", "output": "Just relax.  Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, we can start again."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry.", "input": "", "output": "It's going to be okay. You have a lot of repressed anger and aggression, and that can be difficult to let out."}, {"instruction": "Why did I have to be the angry one?", "input": "", "output": "Do you think you can answer that question?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it wasn't going to be Isaac.  Oh, I hated Isaac sometimes, too. He and Daddy had this bond that I couldn't get inside. That's why they live together now. They're best friends and family. I never could have that.", "input": "", "output": "Issac had your father as his role model.  Was your mother your role model?"}, {"instruction": "I guess, I...I guess I wanted to be so much like her and fill her shoes.  I lost so much more than a mother when she left.", "input": "", "output": "You wanted to emulate your mother and be as important to the family as she was, but she left her position in the household to you before you were ready."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I was placed on a very lonely, very high pedestal.", "input": "", "output": "Who placed you on that pedestal?"}, {"instruction": "Daddy and Isaac. I never wanted...", "input": "", "output": "You never wanted what?"}, {"instruction": "Oh god.", "input": "", "output": "Eliza?"}, {"instruction": "Oh god. Oh god.", "input": "", "output": "What is it, Eliza? What happened?"}, {"instruction": "I wanted the pedestal. Because that's what Mommy was on for all of us. I wanted it. Oh god.", "input": "", "output": "She was your role model.  It's understandable that you wanted what she had."}, {"instruction": "I never knew. I never knew how much I wanted that lonely position.", "input": "", "output": "Is it that it's lonely?  Did you ever let them know how lonely you felt?"}, {"instruction": "Never. I held it in and just felt resentment. Oh sure, part of me enjoyed the hell out of being a princess, but the real side of me--the human side--wanted the affection and attention due to a scared little girl.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think they thought of you as a scared little girl?"}, {"instruction": "No.  They didn't know that part.", "input": "", "output": "Well, how could they have known that you needed to be treated like one?"}, {"instruction": "They couldn't.", "input": "", "output": "So do you think you should be angry with them?  If they didn't know what you needed and you never told them, then it wasn't really their fault.  Why weren't you honest with them about how you felt?"}, {"instruction": "How the hell was I supposed to do that? I was a little girl, for Christ's sake! Just a little girl. And all I knew was that I had to keep it quiet that my Mommy was gone and I was the new mommy. How can a little girl tell someone that she needs some more support? How does a little girl that is trying to be the mommy say, \"Hey, I'm scared and I don't know how to do this.\" How should I have done that? Well?", "input": "", "output": "You were too young to be thrust into that role.  But it may be that you have misplaced your feelings of anger.  Can you explain your anger towards your brother and father?"}, {"instruction": "I can't! It's not rational! And I'm not the bad guy here, she is! She's the one who left and left me all alone!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Eliza. I'm sorry to have made you cry."}, {"instruction": "Liar.", "input": "", "output": "I had to push the limits."}, {"instruction": "No, you didn't.", "input": "", "output": "What would have happened if I hadn't?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me what you think would have happened."}, {"instruction": "We would have never known the truth?", "input": "", "output": "I have to push you, Eliza.  I know this session was emotionally draining.  But I think we got a lot accomplished.  Do you think it was productive?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, it was.", "input": "", "output": "Good, Eliza.  I'd like to schedule you for another session.  Is this time next week okay with you?"}, {"instruction": "Tuesday at noon?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "I'd like that. But please, don't make me cry again.", "input": "", "output": "Well, there are no promises, Eliza. We are going to be exploring painful subjects.  But there's nothing wrong if you express your emotions during our sessions."}, {"instruction": "Well, I have to go. Farewell, good Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Afternoon, dear Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Hello, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Sorry I missed last week.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I was very worried about you."}, {"instruction": "Things were hectic again.", "input": "", "output": "Well, perhaps we should slow your sessions down if you can't make it in but once every other week."}, {"instruction": "Dr. Balis!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Eliza. I had the flu last week and am still feeling a bit under the weather."}, {"instruction": "Well, you don't have to take it out on me.", "input": "", "output": "I really am sorry."}, {"instruction": "So am I. I wish I could have made it in. Things have really slowed down at work and on the home front, so it should be easier to get to my sessions. Can you forgive me, please?", "input": "", "output": "Well..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, good Doctor! I didn't mean to be like this!", "input": "", "output": "I'm pulling your leg, Eliza. Yes, you're forgiven. I would just like your treatment to be a little more consistent. It's like exercising. If you want to get in shape, you have to be on a consistent schedule."}, {"instruction": "And if I want my emotions and such in shape, my sessions need to be consistent. I get it.", "input": "", "output": "Good. Where would you like to begin today?"}, {"instruction": "Well, last time, we talked about Mom.", "input": "", "output": "You're calling her \"Mom\" now?"}, {"instruction": "I think part of me had to forgive her. I can't call her \"Mother\" anymore. I used that word like an insult. On the other hand there's Father...", "input": "", "output": "Are you angry with your father now?"}, {"instruction": "He's not quite the prince I thought he was.", "input": "", "output": "What happened to change your mind?"}, {"instruction": "He's making wedding plans, right? Well, Calypso is being absolutely cool. She wants me in the wedding, along with Isaac. In fact, she's made an effort to meet Mom and have a talk with her about Father. Mom went one step further and gave Calypso a locket she used to carry around with her when she was AWOL from the family. It has Isaac's and my pictures in it. But Father had a fit and said that Calypso can't have it and she definitely can't wear it. I don't know why he reacted like that.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it is a locket his ex-wife used to have."}, {"instruction": "He idolized Mom. He worshipped the ground she walked on. I don't know what happened.", "input": "", "output": "Well, what has changed in the past few weeks?"}, {"instruction": "Family-wise?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Well, let's see.  Isaac and his new girlfriend are already having problems. Father and Calypso are making wedding plans. Isaac and I are doing the same. Father has been distancing himself from me. Calypso is trying to be my new best friend. Mom and I have started to talk about the past. Um, Father and Isaac have been fighting a lot lately. Isaac and Calypso are forming a weird alliance. Isaac refuses to talk to Mom. I don't know what else to tell you. Mom and Calypso are making some tenuous moves toward being kind to each other.", "input": "", "output": "Wait a second.  That's quite a list.  You said that you and your mother are talking about the past?"}, {"instruction": "I finally told her I was going to therapy. She surprised me and said she'd been going for about a year now. All of a sudden, she has a human side. So, I asked her what she went in for. Mom is in therapy to sort out her problems. So, we talked about therapy. And she wanted to know what you and I talk about. I thought to myself, What the hell. Our relationship can't get any worse. I told her, \"A lot of stuff, and you,\" \"Me?\" she said. \"You.\" I said. Then she wanted to know what about her. And there we were, talking about my therapy sessions and her. I finally got up the courage to ask her why she left. She managed to show me, in some sort of way, that her leaving wasn't out of pure malice. So now, Mom and I have started over, and very slowly are working to a point where we can restore our relationship. It's like I'm reading a book which started out poorly, but is suddenly getting better, and I like it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm...maybe your father is reacting to you and your mother's newfound relationship."}, {"instruction": "Maybe, but I don't think that's all that's going on.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "I could see him reacting by distancing himself from me. But I don't know why he is always fighting with everyone around him.", "input": "", "output": "Is this something new from your father?"}, {"instruction": "He's always been the sweetest...Doctor, I'm really worried about this. I don't want to completely lose my father, but it feels like that's what's happening.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps your father is going through some problems that he needs to work out right now.  Preparing for a marriage is often a time for introspection."}, {"instruction": "I don't know, but I miss him.", "input": "", "output": "It's unfortunate that just when you're forging a relationship with your mother that you are experiencing a distancing from your father."}, {"instruction": "But I need to understand where Father is coming from.", "input": "", "output": "I believe you'll have to talk to your father for the answers. I'd like to change the subject if I may."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "Have you thought about the medication?"}, {"instruction": "Well, you already said it was okay.", "input": "", "output": "I've checked with your other doctors and everything seems like it will work out well."}, {"instruction": "But...", "input": "", "output": "But I do need to counsel you a little on your smoking."}, {"instruction": "My...my smoking?", "input": "", "output": "Look, Eliza, smoking is always bad for you.  I know that you know that and I'm not going to give you a general lecture about the dangers of smoking.  I'm sure you've heard it before.  But with regard to the birth control medication you're taking, there's a substantially increased risk of some nasty side effects if you smoke."}, {"instruction": "Oh, Doctor. You are a silly man.", "input": "", "output": "I feel that I am justified in my concern, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "I figured because you were a Doctor, you'd realize why I choose those birth control pills.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I got the ones that were the least likely to cause me harm when I smoke. And I've really cut back on the smoking. I'm down to a pack a day. For me, that's an excellent feat.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I guess you have had this lecture before."}, {"instruction": "Several times, Doctor. I do know that one day, I'd like to quit. Perhaps now is not the time, but it is a goal in the future.", "input": "", "output": "It is wise of you to set goals for yourself."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor. I thought so too.", "input": "", "output": "Well, Eliza, is there anything else on your mind that you need to talk about? Perhaps we can talk about your relationship with Luke."}, {"instruction": "Well, Luke and I are fine. Things at home are kind of boring, if you don't mind me saying.", "input": "", "output": "Not at all. It does seem that our time here is up, though."}, {"instruction": "Oh.", "input": "", "output": "Here's a prescription for Zoloft.  I have a patient information sheet that I'd like you to read.  And I want you to call me, night or day, if you notice anything strange with this medication.  It will take a couple of weeks for us to really be able to evaluate its effect, but I think it could really make a lot of difference in your mood."}, {"instruction": "All right.  How do I take this stuff?", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry.  It's a pill that you'll take once each morning."}, {"instruction": "That's it?  Just one pill a day?", "input": "", "output": "That's it.  We'll see how you're doing on it over the next four weeks or so. Can I schedule you for an appointment for next week?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Will you show up?"}, {"instruction": "That was uncalled for, Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Eliza. I thought I was being humorous."}, {"instruction": "Not quite.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, I have you scheduled for Tuesday of next week.  That's April 15th at noon, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sounds great.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you then, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doctor. See you then.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "D...Dr. Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Eliza...oh!"}, {"instruction": "Oh, it's so horrible!", "input": "", "output": "Eliza, please...oh...please sit in your chair.  We can't have a session with you sitting on my lap the entire time."}, {"instruction": "It's awful!", "input": "", "output": "Please try to stop crying, and tell me what it is.  Oh, dear..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, I'm sorry.  I hate when that happens.  I guess it's bad if other patients see you with blood all over your clothes.  Do you have another shirt?", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, here's a tissue. I've got a stain stick."}, {"instruction": "It's not fair!", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you try to tell me what's wrong."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry, Dr. Balis. I've just had this need lately...", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, Eliza. Tell me what's going on."}, {"instruction": "It's so horrible.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  Here's some Kleenex. We'll start when you catch your breath."}, {"instruction": "I told Luke about my experience.  You know, the one I told you about?", "input": "", "output": "The astral plane experience?"}, {"instruction": "The same.", "input": "", "output": "I gather he didn't take it well?"}, {"instruction": "He got so mad. He accused me of cheating, packed up my things, and kicked me out.", "input": "", "output": "He kicked you out? Where are you staying?"}, {"instruction": "I couldn't stay at Dad's, so I went to Mom's place.", "input": "", "output": "So why did you decide to tell Luke about that experience?"}, {"instruction": "Well, Thursday night we went out for dinner. He started researching the astral plane and was really making an effort to understand my beliefs. So we were talking about it, and it was really great. And he asked me about some of my experiences. So I told him a few.  And then--I couldn't help it, that time was just so amazing for me--it slipped out.", "input": "", "output": "And what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing really. He was very calm about it.  I thought it had been a good thing to tell him, you know?  We were getting really close.  We went to a movie afterwards. But when we got home, he asked me more probing questions about that time on the astral plane. Questions like: \"Do you want to see him again?\" and  \"Do you find him attractive?\" Somehow he read into my answers an admission of guilt of sleeping with someone on the astral plane! He said he read about people who have done that before.  And he said that that's probably why I have a higher sex drive than him. I'm a nympho.  And when I couldn't get what I needed from him, I went and fucked on the astral plane!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I told him that was absolutely absurd! Then he said that if I thought that I needed to defend myself, then I was guilty. So he packed most of my things up for me and placed them by the door. He said he might call me, but not to count on it. It's not fair!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Me too.", "input": "", "output": "Why couldn't you stay at your father's?"}, {"instruction": "That's all screwed up too. After our session last week, I rushed home, determined to talk to him. I barged right in during the middle of an argument between him and Calypso. He was breaking off their engagement right then and there. He said that we're all crowding him and he needed space, and why can't we all just leave him alone! So Calypso left in tears.  And Isaac followed. So now Isaac is staying at Calypso's. They all kind of made up.  And Dad is going to go to a therapist to resolve some issues.", "input": "", "output": "What kind of issues?"}, {"instruction": "His unresolved feelings of unrequited love for my mother.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, my family knows how to put the \"fun\" in \"dysfunctional.\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  So, how is staying at your mother's working out?"}, {"instruction": "Good, actually. She's given me a lot of time to cry and has called in sick for me at work--I just don't feel ready to go in yet. Anyhow, she and Ben--her husband--have been very kind. I always just thought that Ben was just a conservative Republican type, but he actually has a sense of humor and is very nice.

I even miss the pimples on his back.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "I just don't know what to do! I want him back. Should I call him? Should I wait for him to call me? Should I parade past his office with a new guy on my arm every hour? Should I crawl to his front door and scratch at it pathetically, whining? And when he answers it, should I throw my arms around his ankles and hold on for dear life like a Chihuahua?", "input": "", "output": "What do you want to do?"}, {"instruction": "I want to cry and mope!", "input": "", "output": "Expressing your emotions is healthy, but ultimately crying and moping is not a solution."}, {"instruction": "I know. I just...I just want him back so badly.", "input": "", "output": "Then you're going to have to do something about it. It probably won't be today or tomorrow.  But somewhere down the road, you're going to have to figure out what you need to do to get Luke back--if that's truly what you want. I'd really like to start working on that."}, {"instruction": "Okay. Dr. Balis, I'm really feeling weak and very vulnerable. I wish I knew what's going to happen.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Eliza. You're allowed to feel that way. And you're probably going to feel that way for a while.

I know things are far from resolved.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, how does April the 22nd at noon sound?"}, {"instruction": "That's good.  Yes. Thank you, Dr. Balis.  I really needed you.", "input": "", "output": "I'm surprised that you didn't call."}, {"instruction": "I didn't want to bother you.  And I spent most of the past few days just sobbing.  I needed to be held, but Dad was busy being alone.

Graciously, I might add.", "input": "", "output": "So, he presented you with a ring as his apology, and you accepted it, with no arguments or deliberations?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not about to fall into an old trap. We had it out, if that's what you are probing for.", "input": "", "output": "I was."}, {"instruction": "Hmm. Anyhow, Luke came crawling over to my mother's home Friday night, and pleaded his way into the house. Ben wasn't going to let him in until I, in my stupidity and loneliness, demanded that Ben let him in. We went into the living room, and Luke proposed again. At first I told him no. He begged and pleaded and apologized--just weaseled his way into my heart--and I melted. So, I took him back, on one condition.", "input": "", "output": "And that was...?"}, {"instruction": "One mistake--anything that hurts me in a deep way--and we're history for good. Not petty things like astral projection or disagreements, but things like cheating, kicking one another out, that sort of thing.", "input": "", "output": "Are you happy with how things worked out?"}, {"instruction": "Things are coming into place like I want them to. I even got up the nerve to call a creditor back and tell them where to go.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Car loan. Assholes are calling me every two hours, even when I'm at work, making more money to pay them their goddamned payment. I said that if they needed to get a hold of me, why didn't they call me in the evening when I would be home, rather than during the day, when I'm not?

Mom's a Spring, if you look up color charts and things, and I'm a Winter. So, I don't look very good in pastels. I tried on something pink to show her, and she cringed.

It's quite weird.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Well, we never knew each other very well. Now it's more like we are equals, rather than the old Mother-Daughter bullshit.

I know that sounds strange.", "input": "", "output": "No, it doesn't."}, {"instruction": "I just can't let Mom take his place as one of the people who raised me. I never grew up when I was around her. Daddy raised me. She was gone. She wasn't there for films and talks about female sexuality. She wasn't there for the heartaches and breakups. She wasn't there at my Sweet Sixteen birthday party. Well, she was there monetarily. But money doesn't make a mother. So Daddy took over for her. Mom wasn't there through my agonizing physical rehabilitation. Daddy was. Do you see what I mean?", "input": "", "output": "I do."}, {"instruction": "So I've been thinking about all of this and Mom and I sat down the other night to talk. And I told her what was on my mind. She said she didn't blame me and that she was ashamed of the way she acted when she left. I couldn't believe it. It blew my mind. Mom sat down and cried. She feels guilty for missing our lives. She said, \"I know you don't understand why I did what I did. But I did the right thing for me. My only regret is missing out on you and Isaac. I'm not apologizing and I don't expect you to forgive me. All I know is that I may have given birth to you, but your father created you and turned you into an angel.\" So I held her while she cried, smoothed her hair, and shushed her.", "input": "", "output": "Are you embarrassed?"}, {"instruction": "Well...well, yeah.

But this time, it didn't hurt deep inside to do it.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think it didn't hurt?"}, {"instruction": "Well, first of all, I was too young to handle the responsibility with Daddy and Isaac. And secondly, Mom is more like a friend than a mother. She was just a friend who needed comforting.", "input": "", "output": "So you and your mother are friends now?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes and no. We are each trying to learn about the other rather than talking about who we were before. We are starting fresh.

I think I am a bit confused."}, {"instruction": "At the suggestion of his therapist, a Doctor Humdingerschlossenberg or some other such rubbish, he took all of Mom's things that he had stored away--her pictures, art, clothes, everything, even the pillow she slept on and the sheets they got at the wedding--and took it back to her. He held a rummage sale to get rid of their old furniture. It was an act of sheer bravery. He drove over to Mom's with a U-Haul, and knocked bravely on her door. Ben answered it. Now, you have to realize, Ben stands almost a full foot over Dad. But Dad stuck out his chest and asked if my mother was home. Ben snarled, \"Who wants to know?\" Daddy retorts: \"I do, you ogre.\" By then, Mom was at the door. \"What can I help you with?\" she asks Daddy. \"The things that you left are here in the truck. If you want them, you need to unload them, and if you don't, I'll take them to the dumpster and get rid of them for you.\" Well, Mom didn't know what she had left, so they unpacked the truck, all three of them together. And as they were parting, he said, \"I'm going to sell the furniture on Saturday. If you want anything, come and get it. If not, I'll still give you half of the proceeds.\" Mom answers, \"You never had a head for antiques. I'll pick those up and give you half of whatever we make on them.\" They shook on it and Daddy left.

He was supposed to cut her image out and leave a picture with me, Isaac, Daddy, and a hole. It was a horrid, tacky idea and I told Daddy that I thought it would be okay to leave them intact.

He worries me.", "input": "", "output": "Malcolm the Malcontent?  Who calls him that?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, I don't know.  That's just the name he has, but maybe not to his face.  He's the weirdest--incredibly tall and thin, brooding and dark. He scares me, but I am the only person he confides in. I'm the only one who knows why he moved here. I haven't seen him much in the last month or so, since he and Cami broke up, but I know that he's going to come to the show. He likes the music. Camille gave him three tickets, so he's probably bringing Gary and Simon.", "input": "", "output": "Is Camille trying to get him back?"}, {"instruction": "She's trying.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Cami's just...well, she's a little promiscuous. She likes to play cat and mouse games with the men in her life. She likes to string them along. Malcolm won't play, or if he does play, he doesn't play according to Camille's rules. She likes sex. She likes kinky, wild, uninhibited sex. She walks a tightrope all the time, and she doesn't protect herself. And it scares me, more than Malcolm and his unhappy tendencies. Sometimes I feel that there's something horrible, lurking just on the edge, waiting to spring out and trap her.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever told her how you feel?"}, {"instruction": "You can't tell Cami what scares you. She'll do it more just to drive you insane. So I don't tell her. I just \"tsk tsk\" like a mother hen, and pretend to agree with what she's doing. You don't disagree with Camille.

Anders--Alexandria the Great on stage--is a Cleopatra drag queen. He talks like Noxema but acts like Vida, you know from the movie \"To Wong Foo\".

Like in the cartoons, there is a very large woman that controls everything and this little man, and all he says is \"Yes, dear.\" Phillip is an accountant.

I waited around after your performance, saw a crowd gathering, and heard loud, angry voices getting louder and angrier by the second, so I took it as a sign to depart."}, {"instruction": "That was just Malcolm and Camille going at it.  They got kind of physical.", "input": "", "output": "Was anybody hurt?"}, {"instruction": "Malcolm knocked the wind out of her by dropping her to the ground with his karate. Of course, this was after she nailed him in the 'nads.

No one opposes the great and mighty Camille.

He can't control me that way anymore.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that this is a control issue."}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't want to get emotional. I don't want to get bloody.

But I thought you said..."}, {"instruction": "I don't want to be sad about it. But I have every right to be angry and hurt.

Hello? Camille is a skanky little ho. And Luke, the very same who begged forgiveness from me, slept with her. And they were taking photos with his mother's goddamned Polaroid.

I left the pictures that they had taken together. I wanted them to have those snap shots. But these...these are mine. These are for keeps. These are to remind me what a sorry piece of shit I really am.", "input": "", "output": "Eliza, I'm lost. You're a \"sorry piece of shit\" because Luke cheated on you?"}, {"instruction": "No, not because he cheated on me. Because I let him into me. I let him into my heart and soul. I let him hurt me.

It was amazing.", "input": "", "output": "Wait a minute. What exactly did you know?"}, {"instruction": "Well, at first, nothing. I made him promise not to leave until I had a chance to talk to him, and rushed backstage to find out why there was a growing throng on the outskirts there.

He calmed down. Well, my gut instinct was to get him alone and sit down and talk with him.", "input": "", "output": "Weren't you afraid?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know why, but I wasn't. I just felt this need growing inside me, like I was on the edge of a cliff. A little voice ran through my mind, \"You have to talk to him. You have to talk to him. You have to talk to him.\" So I invited him out for coffee. He sneered at the word coffee, but he did say that he wanted to talk to me.", "input": "", "output": "And then what happened?"}, {"instruction": "Luke showed up.", "input": "", "output": "Uh oh."}, {"instruction": "No. He just demanded, \"Who's this?\" I didn't know his name at the time, but he stepped in and introduced himself as an acquaintance of mine. So then I told Luke that we were going out for coffee and asked if he'd like to join us? \"Oh, no,\" Luke said, \"You run along with your little friend.\" So he let us go.", "input": "", "output": "Did you intend to invite him along?"}, {"instruction": "No, but I was going to tell him what was up. Anyhow, I wasn't going to get in trouble over this, so I toddled after Luke and asked him in private if it was really okay for me to go. He said that it was, and that he was planning on going with Anders and everyone out for drinks. He said that we were welcome to join them if we wanted to. I said, \"No, he's a spiritual-type friend. We don't want to muddle our thinking.\" So Luke sent me along and kissed me good night, telling me that he would see me when I got home.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Peter and I left. We went to a little shop open 24 hours in my neighborhood. I drank a lot of coffee and he drank something weird--I think it was \"Wheat Germ Water\" or something nasty like that. Anyhow, I think he may have been the guy in the experience I had.", "input": "", "output": "Wait a minute...the astral plane experience?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. But the weird thing was that he kept trying to get me to admit to being some sort of Sorceress from Biblical times, or something like that. I told him that I knew a little about my past lives, but I didn't think I was ever a sorceress. Normally, people are just ordinary people in their past lives. So many people claim to be the reincarnation of Cleopatra or somebody famous. I'm just me. I was just me. Nobody special. But, other than that bit of weirdness, we connected on a lot of different levels. It was...breathtaking.", "input": "", "output": "Breathtaking?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah! It was amazing! We just spent all night jabbering away like old friends. It was very neat-o. Anyhow, we remembered the concept of time about four in the morning and we both freaked out. Luke was going to be mad at me, and Peter has this whacked out girlfriend-type person that would be mad at him. He kept insisting that she wasn't not his girlfriend--she's his Guru. Yeah, right. So we parted company, and I gave him my e-mail address. I'm waiting for him to write me. He needs my help with that wacko girlfriend--Guru--of his. After all, I am a Wiccan Priestess. So I'm going to help. It's my duty.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it sounds like you had an exciting weekend."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. I also gave my card to this girl I met--I think her name is Chrissy or Christina? Anyhow, she was looking mighty confused about the whole Malcolm business. She's supposed to be his girlfriend, or something. So I'm pretty sure I'll be getting an e-mail from her, too.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean the Malcolm business?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, that's right!  You don't know why they were fighting!  Camille was Malcolm's ex.  Apparently, Camille dropped a little baby bomb on Malcolm when she saw him backstage.  She's about three months now.  That's when Malcolm lost it.  And Camille is underage, too, although if they enforced that law, literally hundreds of men would have to be hauled away.  So Christina was looking like she was walking on rubber or something.  That's when I gave her my card.  I thought she might want to talk.", "input": "", "output": "We really are out of time here, Eliza. Can I schedule a session for next week?"}, {"instruction": "As if you had to ask.", "input": "", "output": "Just checking. So I'll see you here on the 6th of May at noon?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I'll see you then.", "input": "", "output": "Take care, Eliza. And if you need me..."}, {"instruction": "You're only a phone call away. I'll call you if I need you.

See you later."}, {"instruction": "Afternoon, good Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Good afternoon, Eliza. This is a nice house."}, {"instruction": "Not mine--Mom and Ben's. He's in the office right now. He said that he's \"not to be disturbed unless the house is on fire.\"", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What does he do?"}, {"instruction": "First, you come inside. I don't want Luke to see us standing in the doorway if he's trolling about.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, where to?"}, {"instruction": "In here--the parlor.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you."}, {"instruction": "Have a seat. Would you like something to drink? We have all sorts of things, even alcohol, if that's your preference.", "input": "", "output": "No. I'm fine, really."}, {"instruction": "No alcohol on the job, huh?", "input": "", "output": "That's correct."}, {"instruction": "Well, don't get jealous--I'm going to have iced tea, sweetened and with a twist of lemon.", "input": "", "output": "Well, now that you mention it..."}, {"instruction": "Two iced teas coming right up. You just stay right here, and I'll be right back.", "input": "", "output": "That tea looks very nice, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Mom made it. It's scrumptious. Are you comfortable?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Are these the antiques?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, Mom and Dad's antiques? No. These aren't them. Those are in the attic while Ben restores them. It's his hobby. He worked on these, too. It always surprises me what people threw in the trash just because someone painted them baby blue or did some other horrible thing.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. So, how are things?"}, {"instruction": "Do you mind if I sit at the piano? I have to practice, and I'm a motor mouth in front of the \"ebony and ivory.\"", "input": "", "output": "Well, it would probably be better if we stuck to the session."}, {"instruction": "All right, I can practice later anyhow. You asked me what Ben did. Well, actually I don't know. He works from home and is constantly engulfed in paperwork. I think he's a lawyer. He made hints to that or some other horrible thing. Anyhow, that's what he does--just cusses all day about wading through papers. Occasionally, he leaves the house.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  You don't sound very interested in Ben's work."}, {"instruction": "It's not what I like.  Do you want me to sing for you?", "input": "", "output": "I think it might be difficult to carry a conversation that way."}, {"instruction": "Fine with me.", "input": "", "output": "Eliza..."}, {"instruction": "Luke called you yesterday.", "input": "", "output": "Yes he did. How did you know?"}, {"instruction": "Because he's left several messages on Mom and Ben's answering machines. One of which included threatening harm to you if I didn't come home. I'm sorry, Dr. Balis, but I'm not going back even if he kills you.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks."}, {"instruction": "Most of the time he's all talk and no action, though. That's just how he is. Sometimes, he does follow through, but most of the time he doesn't.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think it's possible that he'd try to harm me?"}, {"instruction": "Never can tell.", "input": "", "output": "Eliza, are you afraid?"}, {"instruction": "Terrified.", "input": "", "output": "Are you avoiding the topic?"}, {"instruction": "Indeed I am. You're a perceptive man.", "input": "", "output": "Luke is stalking you--I think we should talk about this, even if it might be difficult for you."}, {"instruction": "Nobody said anything about stalking.", "input": "", "output": "You said that he's \"trolling\" about your home and is calling you several times a day. It sounds like a potentially dangerous situation."}, {"instruction": "He just found out yesterday. It's normal to experience a sense of loss when you lose someone. I managed to slip through his fingers. So, yeah, he's a little grief stricken right now.", "input": "", "output": "He threatened to kill me."}, {"instruction": "That's not my problem.", "input": "", "output": "Eliza, this is not like you. What's going on?"}, {"instruction": "Once again, you crack me open--I'm hurting right now. And I'm scared. And I don't have the nerve to call Peter back. I'm being swallowed whole by my emotions, and it's not a whole lot of fun. On one hand, I keep having nightmares about Luke breaking in and killing me. On the other hand, I'm angry that I even liked--not to mention loved--that turd. And, what's more, I really want to be with Peter right now, but I'm afraid of getting hurt again. And what if the wacko that lives with him answers the phone when I call?", "input": "", "output": "Slow down, Eliza. Let's take one thing at a time. Let's start with Luke."}, {"instruction": "He's threatened to kill me, too. He's threatened to kill everyone, including himself. I'm really tired of looking over my shoulder, and it's only been one day. Every time I try to sleep, I keep having a dream about him breaking in and killing me. Then I wake up, but when I fall asleep again, the dream is back. He's stalking me. He followed me home from work last night. He drove by the house every half-hour in the evening. He slept in his car last night! Do you know how I know?", "input": "", "output": "How?"}, {"instruction": "I looked out of the window this morning, and his goddamned cherry-red Ferrari was parked across the street, like it had been every time I got up during the night and looked out of the window. But part of me still really cares for him. I definitely don't trust him. I don't want to sleep with him. But I want to know that he's okay. I want some comforting for myself. I almost broke down last night and called him back and apologized. But he's the one that owes me the apology. He's the bastard. The bastard that I spent a lot of time with and became a part of. I'm having a reaction very similar to grief--like grief for the death of a loved one.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay to feel hurt. It's even okay to grieve. But it's not about your behavior, it's about Luke's.  When he threatens you and those around you and starts to follow you around, he's way over the line.  Have you thought about a restraining order?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, but only as a last resort.", "input": "", "output": "He's threatening to kill you, Eliza, and you are scared. Why don't you give it some more thought?  I'm thinking about getting one for myself."}, {"instruction": "It's very tempting to jump in and join the bandwagon and get ahead of myself. He may just do this for a couple of days and then leave me alone.", "input": "", "output": "And if he doesn't?"}, {"instruction": "Then I need to hire some bacon to protect poor little old me.", "input": "", "output": "So, if this continues for a few more days, you're definitely going to get some help?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  All a restraining order really does is allow the police to make an arrest when you call and tell them that Luke is violating it.  But that can make a big difference."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, you're worried about my safety?", "input": "", "output": "I always worry about the well-being of my patients."}, {"instruction": "Hmm...well, then I'm sure you have a lot of worries.", "input": "", "output": "Well, I must say that I worry more when they have dangerous ex-boyfriends threatening to kill them. Now tell me about Peter."}, {"instruction": "I'm scared to call him.", "input": "", "output": "What are you afraid of?"}, {"instruction": "I get scared about who's going to answer the phone. Will they be nice? Will they be mean? What if, what if, what if. When I ask myself \"what if\" questions long enough, I lose all my courage, and hide the phone under a pillow for a while and ignore it. Then, I get mad at myself, uncover the phone and look at it, and ask myself all sorts of \"what if\" questions again. Eventually, I give up. I just get discouraged. It's that and the fact that the wacko girlfriend might answer that scares the hell out of me. I mean, I remember what it was like to be a jealous lover. What if she's worse?", "input": "", "output": "What if?"}, {"instruction": "There I go again. It's so discouraging.", "input": "", "output": "Try not to analyze it so much. Just make the call."}, {"instruction": "That's nice coming from you.  You want me to just pick up the phone, dive right in, and dial the number before I have time to hesitate?", "input": "", "output": "Sure."}, {"instruction": "I've tried that. I hang up before I get a voice on the line.", "input": "", "output": "Why?"}, {"instruction": "Because my knees get weak, and I get a sick feeling in my stomach, and my mouth gets dry, so I can't talk to anyone anyway. What's the point in sounding like a hoarse cow?  Actually, I'm afraid to call anyone.  I don't use the phone anymore at all.", "input": "", "output": "It's not just calling Peter?  Is it the people that you're calling or are you afraid of the phone for it's own sake?"}, {"instruction": "People! Phones are inanimate objects!", "input": "", "output": "Well, so are knives. And some people are afraid of them."}, {"instruction": "A phone can't kill someone. I take that back. If you hit someone really hard, right across the temple or whatever, you might kill them...", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you've had a long time to think about that."}, {"instruction": "I watch too much TV.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Look, Doctor Balis, I really hate to be rude. But my mind is really not working properly. Could we continue next week?", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  We're out of time anyway.  Is next week at this time okay?  That's Tuesday, May 13th at noon. Sound good?"}, {"instruction": "Excellent.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you to the door.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "And good day, Doctor. Oh Doctor!", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Eliza?"}, {"instruction": "Here's some light reading for you.", "input": "", "output": "A journal?"}, {"instruction": "Christina recommends it.", "input": "", "output": "The girl from the club?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, she's cool. Well, see you later.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Here you go, Dr. Balis. My most recent gift from Luke. You can have it.", "input": "", "output": "What is it?"}, {"instruction": "Pick her up. I'm sure you'll like her.", "input": "", "output": "Her head fell off!"}, {"instruction": "Amazing.", "input": "", "output": "Luke gave you this doll?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, for Mother's Day.  Like the little cake she's holding says.", "input": "", "output": "For Mother's Day? But you're not..."}, {"instruction": "Ah ah ah...not so fast.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "I might have been, had it not been for the accident.", "input": "", "output": "Your miscarriage? I'm sorry, Eliza. But why would Luke give you such a horrible gift for Mother's Day?"}, {"instruction": "I believe Camille had something to do with it, too.  I think they're trying to hurt me for severing ties.", "input": "", "output": "I see. So, how was Mother's Day?"}, {"instruction": "Honestly?  Isaac and I did some stuff for Mom and Calypso. Even if she's not our step-mother yet, we felt it was a good idea to include her in the festivities.", "input": "", "output": "That was very nice of you.  But I get a feeling that you're avoiding something?"}, {"instruction": "I am. After all the Mother's Day bullshit, it really hit me that I'm not a mother, but that I should have been.  If it hadn't been for Luke's father, I'd be holding a precious little girl in my arms right now. And she would have been my creation, and my finest one.... I've been battling tears all weekend long.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay to cry here, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "It was so long ago, though. And I didn't feel like this last year.", "input": "", "output": "Well, a lot has changed since last year. You were living with Luke then, right?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. And he never gave me anything for Mother's Day last year.", "input": "", "output": "Did Luke's gift trigger the emotions in you or did you feel that way already?"}, {"instruction": "It started before I got the doll. And then when I got it, I wanted to kill them for their heartless cruelty. It's not a nice thing to rub in my loss like that. That and the fact that next year Camille will have a reason to celebrate Mother's Day and I won't.", "input": "", "output": "Do you really want to be a mother?"}, {"instruction": "I would make a good one!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Eliza. I wasn't questioning your competency as a mother."}, {"instruction": "It's okay, actually. Somebody needed to get the funeral out of the air.", "input": "", "output": "Was there a funeral for the baby?"}, {"instruction": "It was a fetus, then, I think. I really don't know. It's just really unfair!", "input": "", "output": "When you think about the baby, how do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Like a huge chunk is missing from my heart.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It's like this...she was a part of me. A part of what I ate, a part of what I breathed, a part of everything I was going through. She was...she was a little me inside of me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you feel like you lost a part of yourself since she's gone?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's right.", "input": "", "output": "But you didn't know that she even existed until after the accident."}, {"instruction": "I don't feel that's important. After the doctor told me, all I could feel was this dull pain inside my belly.  Like there was something there and then it was gone, before I had a chance to get to know it any better. I think...I like to think that part of me knew that she was there. I remember the months before the accident as a very happy time for me. I was going to graduate. Luke had asked me to move in with him, and he'd also presented me with my first diamond. But there are no other survivors from that wreck--just me. Who else is left to blame for the deaths?", "input": "", "output": "Does there have to be blame assigned?"}, {"instruction": "I suppose not. I just keep replaying the events in my mind, how I could have changed them.", "input": "", "output": "How would you have changed them?"}, {"instruction": "I could have taken the keys from Gary and driven the two of us home. I could have walked home. I could have gotten a ride with someone else. I could have made sure that Gary didn't have anything to drink. There are so many things I could have done.", "input": "", "output": "But you didn't."}, {"instruction": "And because of my inaction, two lives were lost.", "input": "", "output": "No, Eliza. You weren't in control of that situation."}, {"instruction": "But I was the sober one.", "input": "", "output": "You were not in control. Can you tell me who was?"}, {"instruction": "I guess...I guess...well, nobody was in control.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "There's nobody to blame?", "input": "", "output": "I definitely don't think you should blame yourself."}, {"instruction": "Is it still okay to be sad that she's not here with me though?", "input": "", "output": "Of course it's okay.  Do you feel sad?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's not terrible anymore. But I want to acknowledge that she existed, even if it was only briefly.", "input": "", "output": "How do you want to acknowledge it? Spiritually?"}, {"instruction": "I can see that. It just might work. I mean, Gary had a funeral, but I don't think that she did. I guess the part I'm saddest about is that there was no permanent ending, if that makes any sense.", "input": "", "output": "It does."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "What is it, Eliza?  What's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead."}, {"instruction": "How come you never told me about Peter?", "input": "", "output": "Peter, your friend?"}, {"instruction": "I think of him as more than that, but you're on the right track...", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean, Eliza?"}, {"instruction": "He's your patient.  Peter told me so.  And he clearly could have benefited from my help as a spiritual advisor.", "input": "", "output": "I never discuss my patients."}, {"instruction": "I know that you don't discuss your patients. So you have to promise that you won't tell anything I tell you to Peter.", "input": "", "output": "Of course.  That's always been true."}, {"instruction": "Terrific.", "input": "", "output": "And it goes both ways--my communication with Peter is strictly confidential."}, {"instruction": "That's all right. He's a very honest person.  If there is something I need to know, I'm sure he would tell me himself.", "input": "", "output": "Of course you are free to talk to Peter about whatever you like."}, {"instruction": "Okay, let's see...Mother's Day; Peter and confidentiality; and, oh yes, honesty...", "input": "", "output": "Honesty?"}, {"instruction": "I was running through a list of topics I wanted to cover this session.", "input": "", "output": "What about honesty, Eliza?"}, {"instruction": "I was figuring that you would wish to know why I hadn't been completely straightforward with you.", "input": "", "output": "The thought crossed my mind a few times as I read your journal from last week."}, {"instruction": "I didn't want anybody to know.", "input": "", "output": "That Luke physically harmed you? Why?"}, {"instruction": "Because that would be admitting that I'm weak.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm?"}, {"instruction": "I got beat up.  I was a weakling--only fit to be smacked around upon a whim. He even let his friends do it.", "input": "", "output": "Why did he arrange therapy for you?"}, {"instruction": "To make it so that I would stop crying.", "input": "", "output": "You mean your fits?"}, {"instruction": "He couldn't hit me when I was crying.  But he wanted to be able to whenever he felt like it--that way he could just smack me around, when he got the urge.", "input": "", "output": "He took a very big risk in sending you to therapy. Didn't he realize that we would discuss things that are painful to you?"}, {"instruction": "You don't understand. He has very little brains up there. I doubt he saw it from that angle. I know that he believed that he could censor our sessions by threatening you with a lawsuit. I'm sure he had no idea that I would enjoy these sessions so much.", "input": "", "output": "When did you decide you wanted to go into therapy?"}, {"instruction": "After he threw me down a flight of stairs, breaking my wrist and ankle, and bruising two ribs. I needed to find a way out. Thank you for helping me achieve that goal.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad I was able to help. And thank you for finally telling me the truth."}, {"instruction": "It was time.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  We're out of time for today, Eliza.  But I think we had a good session."}, {"instruction": "Out of time so soon?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I'm afraid so. Can I schedule you for next week? Let's see...that would be Tuesday, May 20th at noon? Sounds okay?"}, {"instruction": "That sounds great, Doctor Balis.  And here's my journal from last week.  I think you'll find a few surprises in here, too.", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes it's easier to write things down than to say them out loud.  I'll look forward to reading it. And I'll see you next week, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "See you then. Ta-ta.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Uh huh?", "input": "", "output": "Are you all right?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Here, sit. Tell me what's going on."}, {"instruction": "Pain in me, all over, randomly popping up anywhere.", "input": "", "output": "Have you been taking your painkillers?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, taking meds is a little religion of mine. It's called Percocetism.", "input": "", "output": "You look a little better now that you are sitting."}, {"instruction": "It went away.", "input": "", "output": "What went away?"}, {"instruction": "The pain.", "input": "", "output": "But you said that you have been taking your painkillers. So tell me, what is this pain like?"}, {"instruction": "It's been happening off and on since last Saturday. It hurts like a bitch. It's a stabbing sensation, really, but one moment it's in my shoulder, the next thing I know, it's in my ass. One time I thought I was having a heart attack.", "input": "", "output": "Have you seen your general practitioner yet?"}, {"instruction": "It's not serious enough to warrant a trip to the hospital.", "input": "", "output": "Eliza, this could be a sign of more serious things to come."}, {"instruction": "Like what? Death? Impossible. My life line is way too long for me to die anytime soon.", "input": "", "output": "Life line?  Like on your palm?"}, {"instruction": "Palmistry, yeah. See this line right here? That's a life line. See how long it is?", "input": "", "output": "I suppose so, Eliza. But I still think that you ought to go to your doctor and see if you might need to change medication, at the very least."}, {"instruction": "I'll think about it.", "input": "", "output": "How about acting on it?"}, {"instruction": "Only if it gets worse. I'm not a hypochondriac.", "input": "", "output": "I didn't mean to imply that you were. How are things going with getting your restraining order?"}, {"instruction": "Um...Ah well...", "input": "", "output": "You haven't gotten it yet."}, {"instruction": "Well...", "input": "", "output": "Eliza, the longer you put off getting that order, the more time Luke has to figure out how he is going to handle your leaving. And I personally don't think that he is going to handle it well."}, {"instruction": "I'm working on it, okay?", "input": "", "output": "Eliza, I am worried for your personal safety."}, {"instruction": "Me too. I'll get it, soon.", "input": "", "output": "How soon?"}, {"instruction": "Soon enough. Back off. What did I do to you?", "input": "", "output": "I may be a little pushy, Eliza, but I can't stress safety enough."}, {"instruction": "Okay. I'm sorry. It's just been a long-ass week, what with this pain thing and everything else. Josie thinks that he is straight and has been in love with me since he met me in high school. We went to a movie Friday and then out for coffee afterward, like we usually do. Well, then he's got his hands all over me, trying to tell me that he is leaving Robin for me...yaddah yaddah yaddah. I feel that when it comes to men, when it rains, it pours.", "input": "", "output": "How are you handling that situation?"}, {"instruction": "As gently as possible. Josie is like a brother to me. I've known him forever. Actually, I think the situation may have resolved itself. He came to me this morning and apologized for his behavior and said that he's going to try and work things out with Robbi. It's a weird situation that I think will work out okay once Josie gets everything straightened out with himself.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "So what now?", "input": "", "output": "I have a question for you. It may seem like it's none of my business, but I'm a little curious."}, {"instruction": "Oh, come on. I am your business.", "input": "", "output": "Were any of the injuries you mentioned about the car accident Luke's doing, or were they purely a result of the accident?"}, {"instruction": "Just the accident. Luke may have been an extremely abusive asshole, but he never left any marks on me besides bruises. Before the accident, things were well with us and I was an obedient girlfriend to him. No need for beating me then.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I mean...well...Luke did a lot of things to me. He pushed me around a lot, both physically and mentally. He smacked me around every now and then. Occasionally, there was rape involved. He wasn't sadistic, though. Just angry. Mean. Violent. But he wasn't sadistic. Thank gods for small favors. He never took any cutting utensils to me, didn't try to light me on fire. And I pretended that I was the one at fault, which is what I guess most battered women do.", "input": "", "output": "So you endowed him with qualities he didn't have to make up for his abusiveness?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so. Damn. You now, I just now realized that I am one screwed up individual.", "input": "", "output": "You have had a difficult past."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I can see it now: how I can be described by breaking down my life into little chunks of dysfunctionality. My mother abandoned us when I was little, and then she came back and took us away from dad and then gave us back. I met a guy I thought was Prince Charming until I was misbehaving. Then he turned into Prince Beating. His drunken father got me into a car accident where I lost a baby. I was blamed for the car accident. I believed the blame and took it...and so on.", "input": "", "output": "When did you stop believing that you were the one to blame?"}, {"instruction": "When he pushed me down the stairs.", "input": "", "output": "How long ago was that?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, about a year ago.", "input": "", "output": "So you pretended for about a year?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it just now came conscious, I guess. I realized I was tired of getting a beating every time I voiced my opinion, and started looking around me at all of these other women in loving relationships. I wondered if they were smacked around, too. And I saw how Dad and Isaac treated women, and realized that what Luke was doing to me was not natural. So I pushed Luke to get me to a mental doctor to see if we could get me to stop crying. And he thought that was a great idea.", "input": "", "output": "But the reason he thought it was a great idea was that, when you stopped having crying fits, he could harm you as he pleased?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, that's right. I don't know why he couldn't hit me when I was crying, but he couldn't.", "input": "", "output": "Did he treat other women this way?"}, {"instruction": "I think, and hope, it was just me.", "input": "", "output": "But you don't know for sure?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he didn't treat his mother that way. I didn't meet any other girlfriends from the \"pre-me\" era. So I really don't know. All I know was that he was obedient to his mother, doing everything she asked.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Did I tell you that I got a cat?", "input": "", "output": "I read it in your journal."}, {"instruction": "She's cute.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sure she's a handful."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I have a picture of her destroying my wallet.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I take it that you're finished talking about Luke for a while?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. There are many things I can say about him, but it all comes down to the same thing. He hit me. I took it, until I couldn't take it anymore.", "input": "", "output": "You really should get the restraining order."}, {"instruction": "Soon, Dr. Balis, soon.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Is there anything else you would like to talk about?"}, {"instruction": "Well, this week's journal is brief. But I'd like to explain Letitia and Mordred.", "input": "", "output": "Okay..."}, {"instruction": "When I was sixteen, I was just dabbling in astral projection. I went to many scary places, and whenever something was going to get me, I was saved by something or other. So, one day, I'm wandering about, looking for something or other, and these two beings come to me. A female and a male.", "input": "", "output": "Letitia and Mordred?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. On the astral plane, Letitia stands about...oh, seven feet tall and is thin and wavy like a willow tree. She shimmers. Mordred is horribly ugly, not because he wants to be, but because he has AIDS and is dying. When he is really sick, he is transparent, and becomes extremely ugly. He looks like a big sticky leaf pile with eyes and a mouth. But he is kind, and he tries to be strong. And it turns out that they have been helping me. They have been doing me favors without me asking them. So I decide, secretly, that I need to repay them. Well, another time, I'm wandering about as the raven, and I see them below being taunted by a group of some things. Well, I didn't know what to do. Letitia and Mordred are strong, but this was a group of about five things that were stronger than them. So I decided that I would get them out of there, but I didn't know how. I remembered that one time when I was the raven and I wanted to be in my elven form, I became a column of flame. So I swooped down out of the sky and surrounded Letitia and Mordred with my fire, and before I became elven, I came off of the ground, carrying them in the column that my body was in. So I got them away from the things. And they said that they would spend their lives trying to repay me.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I know it sounds far-fetched, Dr. Balis, but even if they only exist in dreams, we know that I have a great imagination and would be a good writer of sci-fi or fantasy.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "We're out of time, aren't we?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, we are."}, {"instruction": "Let's see, you want me here next week. That's the 27th of May at noon.", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Well, pencil me in.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "I'll see you later.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome."}, {"instruction": "Yes, they did. How sweet of them. It wasn't a heart attack after all. But, then again, I didn't think it was.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear it."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Where would you like to start today?"}, {"instruction": "Well, let me see. I already told you how my Monday went.  And you got to meet Mom. Let's start with...trickery.", "input": "", "output": "Trickery? That's a different topic."}, {"instruction": "I tricked you into admitting that Chris was a patient of yours, even though I really didn't know who her therapist was. I'm sorry. I think it must have been all those drugs they gave at the hospital to calm me down. Does that breach our trust thing?", "input": "", "output": "A little, but I'm willing to let it slide, considering the circumstances."}, {"instruction": "The future Mrs. Balis is a lucky woman to have someone so forgiving.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you think that I'm not married?"}, {"instruction": "No ring.", "input": "", "output": "Oh. I guess I hadn't really noticed."}, {"instruction": "And no pictures of the family strewn about. That's pretty standard in a doctor's office.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Chris and I are going to have to set you up--you deserve someone nice.", "input": "", "output": "Well, thank you, Eliza, but..."}, {"instruction": "You're welcome. Can I talk about my weekend now?", "input": "", "output": "Please, go right ahead."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.  Let me see...oh, I needed to clarify some things about last night that I found out about this morning. The reason Malcolm was there, and you will never believe this, is because of Anders.", "input": "", "output": "You mean, Anders--the drag queen bassist?"}, {"instruction": "The same. Apparently, Chris had told him what a beast Mal is, and Anders rushed over to Roma's to tell him off. Malcolm managed to calm the prancing queen down and told dear old Anders his side of the story. At which point, Anders looked deep into his frappachino and sighed: \"Ah, the burden of star-crossed lovers.\" I opened my big mouth and told Anders about the Memorial day party.  He hopped off the phone with me and hopped back on with Malcolm, arranging a surprise visit.", "input": "", "output": "Anders was trying to get Christina and Malcolm back together?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. But I don't think that's going to work. Chris was pretty pissed at him for lying to her. In fact, I was pretty pissed at being lied to, as well. And Chris tried to accuse me of going along with him in deceiving her. I wasn't, of course, but she tried to get me to admit to it. I think she finally believed me, but that was the first major argument that we had as friends. I don't know quite how to feel about Mal, right now. I mean, he lied to me too, but he also saved Peter from irreparable damage.", "input": "", "output": "I see. And how is Peter?"}, {"instruction": "I honestly don't know. He cleared out pretty fast, leaving me with an \"I'll write you soon.\" I miss him when he's away, but I also get frustrated with him. I've encouraged him to come back to you for help. But he's like me when I talk about  the restraining order--\"Soon,\" he tells me. \"Soon.\" I just hope to gods that his \"soon\" doesn't turn out like my \"soon\" did.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that it will?"}, {"instruction": "Well, in his last few e-mails to me, he hinted at the fact that she's beating on him now, which pisses me off to no end, being a survivor of physical abuse myself. And if she is voodooing me...which I don't think she is, but if she is then she's got another thing coming. You know, making someone stay with you against their own free will encroaches upon the Law of Three.", "input": "", "output": "What is the Law of Three?"}, {"instruction": "\"Bide the Wiccan law ye must, in perfect love, in perfect trust. Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill: an ye harm none, do what ye will. What ye send forth comes back to thee, so ever mind the Rule of Three.

And believe me, if you do, you deserve every bit of it, too.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "If Serena is sending out her loathing of me, then she's going to get what's coming to her. The Wiccan Rede can't be broken, except in times of self-defense. I've got everything on her, if she's trying to harm me. But I have to find out if she's doing it first.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that she is harming you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. She might be. Or I might just have an over-active imagination.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm.  How was yesterday evening all together?"}, {"instruction": "All in all, I might find this funny...in twenty years or so, but not now.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. How was the rest of your weekend?"}, {"instruction": "I spent Saturday and Sunday at Granny and Grampy Ravenski's.", "input": "", "output": "How did that go?"}, {"instruction": "They live out in the country in the Anderson Valley, and they're probably the most pagan people that I've every met. So many pagans live this pipe dream in the city--they'll have gardens and go back to nature. But those pagans do nothing about it. When Granny found her calling in Wicca, she went with it and dragged her husband into it, too! She hauled them off to the country and bought a farm, where she has gardens upon gardens, trees, and her own space in the wilds, as she puts it.", "input": "", "output": "Your grandparents are both Wiccan?"}, {"instruction": "The former High Priest and Priestess of The Coven of the Weeping Willow. They introduced me to Wicca. Granny has this huge library of books. She tries to get every pagan book out there for people to do research from. That, and so she can boast about how many books she has read. She brags even more now--she got that speed reading program from TV and can read a whole book in a half hour.", "input": "", "output": "Impressive.  It sounds like you care about your grandparents very much."}, {"instruction": "I do. My first pagan teachers, that's what they are.  And I can never repay them for helping me find my spiritual path. But anyhow, that's not what the whole weekend was about.", "input": "", "output": "There's more?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, there's more. On a more serious note, we buried the baby.", "input": "", "output": "Pardon?"}, {"instruction": "We buried the doll that Luke gave me for Mother's Day. And I finally had that funeral for my baby.", "input": "", "output": "How do you feel about that?"}, {"instruction": "At peace with myself. Granny and I performed the ritual. I cried a whole lot.  But we laid her memory to rest--set her free. Grampy and I sat out in his shop, afterwards, and talked a long time. He didn't blame me for the accident, or for the miscarriage. It was the first time that I ever really felt blameless for the whole thing. I guess Grampy's like that. He's a teacher that shows, as opposing to being a teacher that tells, like Granny. I guess that's why they're perfect for each other. I've never met a more loving couple...well, besides for Anders and Phillip, but that's a different story.", "input": "", "output": "Speaking of your band, how is Josie?"}, {"instruction": "Crazy. Absolutely insane. He came to me this morning and told me that he's not gay after all.  He knows that, now. Apparently, he went to some psychic who told him that he wasn't gay and that he was in love with me--just what he wanted to hear, I presume. He asked me to help him tell Robin that he's moving in with me! Of all the nerve!", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "I told him that there's no way in hell that he's moving in with me. I told him that he's going to go to therapy and sort out his confusion.

I did over-react. But this male pressure has got me going crazy. And to top it all off, I got a phone call from Isaac this week, sobbing about his love-life. Apparently, Wendy, the wench, stole his charge card and managed to ruin his credit.  Dad talked him into breaking up with her.  Now Isaac's miserable and thinks that I should be too--now that I'm \"all alone,\" as he put it.", "input": "", "output": "Here are the tissues, Eliza. Do you think that you are all alone?"}, {"instruction": "Sometimes. But I have to move on. I can't be dragged down simply because my older brother never matured. That's selfish of him.

I'm getting so bogged down in emotion here that I can't think straight.", "input": "", "output": "How are you getting bogged down?"}, {"instruction": "Everyone's been dumping their problems on me lately. I can't handle all of this. I like the fact that people confide in me, but it's starting to really get to me. Do you ever feel like that, Doctor Balis?

Thank you so much.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "And thank you for prescribing Zoloft.", "input": "", "output": "How is that working out for you?"}, {"instruction": "As you can see, it's calmed me down a lot. I feel better about taking it now. I know that it's going to make me stop crying all of the time. I feel more in control of my life. That's good, right?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Eliza. That's good. But it looks like we're out of time here."}, {"instruction": "Really? We just started a minute ago...", "input": "", "output": "It's been an awfully long minute."}, {"instruction": "Your corny jokes are killing me, Doctor Balis. Same time, same place, next week?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. That's June 3rd, at noon."}, {"instruction": "Great. Awesome. Cool. See you then.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Spare me your lectures, Doctor Balis. Please, if only for my sanity.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Why don't you have a seat?"}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "So, what's been going on?"}, {"instruction": "This.", "input": "", "output": "Eliza, those bandages.

Yes.", "input": "", "output": "Eliza..."}, {"instruction": "Once again, Doctor Balis, please spare me the lectures. Spare me the \"It's the coward's way out\" lecture.

That's not what I'm here for. I'm here to help you."}, {"instruction": "I don't know anymore. All I can do is cry.

I was sitting in my closet, bawling--and I don't even know why I was crying--when this thought popped in my head.  This little taunting voice was saying: \"You pathetic miserable snob.  The world would be a better place of you were dead.\" And I believed it.", "input": "", "output": "Who's voice was it?"}, {"instruction": "Mine.  It was me telling myself how horrible I really am, and that I didn't deserve to live.", "input": "", "output": "What did you do?"}, {"instruction": "What does it look like I did? I headed to the bathroom and ran a tub of hot water, went back to my room and got my exacto knife, and then headed back to the bathroom. I stepped into the boiling pot and relaxed, thinking of how wonderful it was all going to be once I was dead and didn't have to put up with my miserable existence any more.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay to cry, Eliza. Here are some tissues."}, {"instruction": "It's not okay! Nothing is okay!", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Eliza. Can you please continue?"}, {"instruction": "When I figured I had soaked long enough, I got the knife and prepared to slice my wrists.  I made a few tentative cuts. And then, I realized that the cuts weren't deep enough.  I started to cry because if there was one thing that I wanted to do right, it was this. I got mad and hacked quickly at each wrist. Then the blood started to flow, and something popped back in my brain.", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "It was Peter.  He was crying at my grave, and I couldn't bear it. I gave a blood curdling shriek and leaped out of the tub, holding one wrist and then the other. Apparently my mother heard the scream, because the next thing I know--I was searching for gauze and things--the door flies open, and there's my mother.  She looked scared to death, and I stopped. For a few seconds, all I could hear was the splashing of the water and blood droplets on the floor, my heart pounding rapidly. And then my mother exploded in tears and rage, telling me that I was a stupid little bitch and how on earth could I be so selfish. Of course I was bleeding on her white carpeted floor.  I started bawling. Which is when Ben, in all his quiet reservedness, stepped between us and found the gauze and started to clean me up. The cuts I made weren't deep enough to kill...well, since I missed the veins, anyhow. He bandaged me up.  My mother was screaming in hysteria in the hall the entire time. And Ben was asking me if I needed or wanted to go to the hospital, or should he call you, Doctor Balis, and just all sorts of questions. All I could do was continue to cry and shake my head no. I didn't want anyone to know. We got the blood to stop. Ben managed to get me into my robe somehow.  And then he picked me up in his arms and carried me to my bed. I laid there while Ben stroked my hair and cried until I fell asleep. I could still hear my mother screaming and wailing in the hall.  But Ben didn't say a word, just stroked my hair.", "input": "", "output": "You should have called me, Eliza.  Before doing anything, you should have called me."}, {"instruction": "I knew you would say that. I just didn't want to face you anymore.", "input": "", "output": "Why not?"}, {"instruction": "Because you always say the right thing.  But at the time I was doing this, I only wanted a confirmation that what I was doing was the right thing, even if in my heart of hearts I knew it wasn't.", "input": "", "output": "I see.  How are your family and friends handling this?"}, {"instruction": "Only Calypso and Ben are talking to me right now. Oh, and my grandparents. That's about it. Isaac only came over to bring me a single rose.  He looked at me with such baleful eyes. My father hasn't been over at all.  And my mother...well, she spends all of her time in her own room crying. Ben insisted that I go back to therapy.  He drove me here today to make sure I got here. As for my friends, I haven't told anybody really. I've managed to avoid them by staying up too late and sleeping through the day. And there is no way in hell that Peter knows.  Unless through some cosmic shift, he knows without me telling him, which is possible.", "input": "", "output": "So it was the image of Peter crying at your grave that stopped you?"}, {"instruction": "I can't leave him right now.  Not like that. It would have devastated him if I...and that's the last thing he needs.", "input": "", "output": "You really care for Peter."}, {"instruction": "I guess I really do, don't I?

I hyperventilate.  I start to cry.  And I'm so lonely, too. I never get to see Peter--we have to resort to mail. Sometimes I wonder if he even cares about me, but I have to push those thoughts away. And every day, life just gets harder and harder. I just can't cope with the real world anymore. So I tried to exit it. And when that didn't work, I resorted to hiding.", "input": "", "output": "But that doesn't help, does it, Eliza?"}, {"instruction": "No...and I'm so, so sorry.", "input": "", "output": "You don't need to apologize, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Yes, I do. I'm a miserable, horrible, rotten person.", "input": "", "output": "Listen to yourself, Eliza. Do you really mean what you just said?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know.", "input": "", "output": "Think about it for a minute. Are you really a miserable, horrible, and rotten person?"}, {"instruction": "No...I guess not.", "input": "", "output": "Then why are you saying that about yourself?"}, {"instruction": "Because I deserve all the hate and loathing I can get.", "input": "", "output": "Does anybody else deserve that?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Then why just you?"}, {"instruction": "Because...just because.", "input": "", "output": "Eliza, please listen to what you're saying."}, {"instruction": "I'm not making any sense any more.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Eliza. You're just tired."}, {"instruction": "Yes, Doctor.  I'm very tired.  I think I should go now.", "input": "", "output": "Wait a little before you go."}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "I want you to close your eyes, Eliza. That's good. Now, clear your mind. Make it completely blank. Okay? Good. Now I want you to remember a time in your life when you felt that you were beautiful.  Beautiful inside and out.  I want you to remember a particular moment in your life when life was good for you."}, {"instruction": "I can't.", "input": "", "output": "Try, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "I still can't.", "input": "", "output": "Sure you can, just let your mind wander."}, {"instruction": "Oh, yeah...I was thirteen and I was getting a dress for the eighth grade prom.  I walked out and my father's jaw hit the floor.  I turned around to face the mirror and there I was.", "input": "", "output": "You were beautiful, Eliza.  Good.  That was a good time in your life.  Okay, do you have that image set in your mind? Great.  Okay, try to keep that image in your mind.  Remember it especially when you are feeling low or in dire straits, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. I can open my eyes, right?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Okay, Doctor Balis. I'm sorry I don't have a journal for the past couple of weeks, but I haven't been feeling well.", "input": "", "output": "No problem, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Then I'll see you next week.", "input": "", "output": "Can I ask you whether you have any plans to try to take your life again?"}, {"instruction": "I'll call you, I promise.", "input": "", "output": "That's not what I asked you, Eliza.

It's getting late and I'd like to go now.", "input": "", "output": "Actually, I think it would be best if you spent a few days in the hospital.

I don't want to go to a hospital.", "input": "", "output": "It will be only for a couple of days, I'm sure.  It's very nice--the California Pacific Medical Center. You were there before, I think.

This is like that.  I really have no choice."}, {"instruction": "I'm not sick like that, really.", "input": "", "output": "I'm sorry, Eliza.  I don't agree.  Those bandages on your wrists and the fact that you started the session by telling me how you were sorry that you didn't succeed are pretty good indications that you need to go to the hospital."}, {"instruction": "Oh, shit.  Can my brother come and visit me there?  Can Peter?", "input": "", "output": "Sure they can.  We'll put them on your visitors list."}, {"instruction": "You mean you can keep my mother out?", "input": "", "output": "Yes we can, if you like."}, {"instruction": "I guess on some level I know that this is the right thing to do.  But I'm not very happy about it.", "input": "", "output": "We'll get you through this rough stage, and then things will be a lot better.  Have you been taking your medication regularly?"}, {"instruction": "Do you mean Zoloft?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do."}, {"instruction": "I always have trouble taking pills.  I've been taking them on and off.

He's waiting for me downstairs.", "input": "", "output": "Good.  We'll talk to him on the way out.  Are you ready now?"}, {"instruction": "I guess so.  But it's a little scary.", "input": "", "output": "That's okay.  I'll be there with you.  Let's go."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis. How are you?", "input": "", "output": "I'm doing well. How are you?"}, {"instruction": "As well as can be expected.", "input": "", "output": "Is that so?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah. That's so. I feel like I let everyone down.

I'm just feeling like a smart-ass.", "input": "", "output": "Ahh, I see."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it's been an earthshaking couple of weeks, kind of. Really weird. I feel like some great big hand reached out and smacked me back into reality.

What is it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, only if you'll help me implement it.", "input": "", "output": "Of course I'll help you. What does this plan entail?"}, {"instruction": "I just want you to help me help myself--which is what you were doing before. But...well...I don't know. It's like I need you more now than ever before.

Not that I didn't want the help before...well, I don't know what I'm saying.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps you've realized how valuable therapy can be to you."}, {"instruction": "Yes. That's it. You're more valuable to me now. I know I need your help now as opposed to before, when I just wanted your help like an instant fix. Maybe now I realize it's something that we have to work on together.", "input": "", "output": "I'm really pleased, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "I just want you to know that when I sliced myself, it wasn't because of your lack of trying.  It was my lack of trying.", "input": "", "output": "How did you not try, Eliza?"}, {"instruction": "I didn't. I didn't care about the medication, I didn't care about the sessions, and I didn't try to work on my problems.

What made you change your mind?"}, {"instruction": "You mean about suicide? Like I said, it was a really freaky week. First, there was running into Peter in the hospital.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, it was weird. I couldn't help but feel this overwhelming sense of complete failure. I mean, there he was weak and vulnerable and shocked half to death when he saw my wrists. And he looked hurt. Like I didn't care enough about him. I don't think either of us were taking very good care of ourselves. I suppose the double shock was enough to jolt us--if only slightly--back into the real world where we need each other very much. Even if he doesn't need me as a lover, or girlfriend or whatever, he still needs me spiritually. And maybe, I need him to teach me, and to help me grow, and to learn from. I would be happy to have him as my lover. In fact, I'd be overjoyed. But I don't think it's ever going to happen. At least not until he comes out of the clouds and sees the beauty in the mundane world. I think I woke up when I saw him there.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Did anything else happen these past two weeks?"}, {"instruction": "Most recently, I saw my grandparents.", "input": "", "output": "Good."}, {"instruction": "Granny was very upset with me. Damn, I failed everyone. But she said that whatever is gnawing at me must be stopped. I told her about the unnamed pain, and she took it upon herself to have an emergency coven gathering--all thirteen of them--along with all of my solitary pagan friends. I got to meet Letitia and Mordred in person. It was exciting and scary.  I'm amazed that the hospital let me do this.", "input": "", "output": "I told them it was okay."}, {"instruction": "I should have known you had something to do with that--they gave me no trouble.", "input": "", "output": "I thought it would be good have your grandparents involved.  So please tell me about the gathering."}, {"instruction": "We all cast the SpiderWeb for me together, infusing it with so much more power. It was the most powerful experience I had ever felt. All of these people that love me were standing in a circle, raising all of this power, and giving it to me, and weaving the web with me. I have never felt stronger. I actually felt divinity. And that's something that I've not felt for a long....it was pure magic, Doctor Balis. I'm sure you don't understand, so let me just say that it was  awesome.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad it was such a positive experience for you."}, {"instruction": "And it was great meeting Letitia and Mordred in the flesh.  Astounding and wonderful. Letitia was all that I've assumed she would be. And Mordred cried when he saw me. A lot of people have been doing that--crying, I mean.  I wonder why? Anyhow, he gave me this little blurb he calls \"Inspirational.\" Can I read it?", "input": "", "output": "Certainly."}, {"instruction": "Okay, I need to tell you the background story first.  Okay?", "input": "", "output": "Go ahead.  I'm listening."}, {"instruction": "All right.  There was this guy--Jerry.  And the one thing that Jerry was always noticed for was his attitude. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he'd reply, \"If I were any better, I would be twins!\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Jerry had a job as a head waiter.  He was a unique manager, because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. And the reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.", "input": "", "output": "I agree, that could make Jerry a better manager."}, {"instruction": "There's more, Doctor Balis. So this one guy was curious and went up to Jerry and asked him how he could be so positive all the time.  I mean, even Jerry must have a bad day once in a while, right?", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "So Jerry's reply was the \"Inspirational\" that Mordred gave me.  I'll read it to you now:  \"Each morning I wake up and say to myself, 'Jerry, you have two choices today. You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood.' I choose to be in a good mood. Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim, or I can choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it. Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining, or I can point out the positive side of life. I choose the positive side of life. Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people will affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or a bad mood. The bottom line: it's your choice how you live life.\"", "input": "", "output": "Very interesting..."}, {"instruction": "That's not all.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "There's the rest of Jerry's story. One night, Jerry did something you're never supposed to do in a restaurant business--he left the back door open. He was held up at gunpoint by three armed robbers. While trying to open the safe, his hand, shaking from nervousness, slipped off the combination. The robbers panicked and shot him. Luckily, Jerry was found relatively quickly and rushed to the local trauma center. After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Jerry was released from the hospital with fragments of the bullets still in his body.", "input": "", "output": "What a horrible story."}, {"instruction": "Don't worry, Doctor Balis, it has a good ending.  The same guy sees Jerry six months after the accident and asks him how he was. Jerry replies, \"If I were any better, I'd be twins. Want to see my scars?\" This guy doesn't want to see Jerry's scars, but he does want to know what had gone through Jerry's mind as the robbery took place. And Jerry said, \"The first thing that went through my mind was that I should have locked the back door. Then, as I lay on the floor, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live, or I could choose to die. I chose to live. The paramedics were great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the emergency room and I saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared. In their eyes I read, 'He's a dead man.' I knew I needed to take action.\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "There was a big burly nurse that shouted questions at Jerry.  Stuff like: \"Do you have any allergies?\"  And Jerry replied: \"Yes.\" The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for Jerry to speak. Jerry took a deep breath and yelled: \"Bullets!\" Everyone in the emergency room laughed, and Jerry told them: \"I'm choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead.\" Jerry lived thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude. It's a good story, don't you think, Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, it is.  And it looks like it made a big impression on you. Your friend Mordred is a very insightful man."}, {"instruction": "He's not a man, Doctor Balis. He's a little boy. He's only ten years old. But this was so powerful to me. He gave me this gift. I chose to run with it.", "input": "", "output": "I'm very glad.  I have a feeling that you're on your way to recovery. How do you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Like I took the biggest plunge ever. It's exciting and scary, but it's so worth it.", "input": "", "output": "That's great. I've been thinking a lot about you lately, and I took the liberty of running off copies of a book that I think will be especially useful to you right now. I'm only giving you chapters one and two for now."}, {"instruction": "Like a reading assignment. Hey, that's cool. Homework. I never thought I would look forward to it.", "input": "", "output": "It's called \"Rapid Relief from Emotional Distress.\" I really think you could benefit from it."}, {"instruction": "That's awesome. I'll get right on it.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it looks like we're about out of time."}, {"instruction": "As usual.", "input": "", "output": "I'll see you here next week, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Sure thing.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, then. Goodbye, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Hello, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "So, what's going on this week?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I read the first two chapters of the book you gave me last time. I think I've become really aware of how I think.", "input": "", "output": "That's good."}, {"instruction": "Well, I know I'm dealing with a lot of resentment and control issues.", "input": "", "output": "Resentment and control are certainly two very potent issues."}, {"instruction": "I know. But the resentment comes from a lack of control of a situation. Like when I was a child and my mom left, I couldn't control the situation and I resented mom because she did. You see?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I do."}, {"instruction": "Also, when I read the chapters, part of me was thinking: \"This is great! Wow!\" And another part was thinking: \"Bullshit.\"", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad you've become aware of what you're thinking."}, {"instruction": "Me too. The book is helping, even the small portion that I have read. But the book isn't all I want to talk about today.", "input": "", "output": "What's on your mind?"}, {"instruction": "Peter.", "input": "", "output": "Peter Hossfeld?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I got a frantic...well, maybe not frantic, but that's how I saw it. I got a frantic call from him, asking me to come over. I've never been to his place, and I've been missing him so much lately. I can't describe what it is. Maybe it is love, maybe it isn't. I don't know what it is. But I feel empty when he's gone, or I haven't seen him in a long time. I don't know. Doctor Balis, I'm in love, aren't I?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know. Do you think you're in love with Peter?"}, {"instruction": "I have all the classic symptoms--I like him, and he's a friend. I can't see my life without him. I get mad when I hear about how Serena's treating him. And yeah, I'm a little jealous, of course. I mean, I love him and I can't have him.", "input": "", "output": "How does that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I don't know. I think I expressed myself pretty well, just now. I'm jealous of Serena. She controls him. There's another control resentment issue right there. I resent her for controlling Peter...but I think I can do something about it...but anyway. May I continue?", "input": "", "output": "Sure, go ahead."}, {"instruction": "Well, I get this phone call. He tells me Serena is out and he wants to see me. I rush over to his place. It was really awkward at first--neither of us had seen each other in so long. He asked me about my wrists. I told him that life has been difficult--and it has been. And I asked him where he'd been for so long. He thought that I was blaming him for my attempt. Maybe I was--I haven't really tried to process it yet.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I asked what Serena's been doing to him. I mean, Jesus! He looked like Skeletor from He-Man! It was just awful--he was gaunt and wasted. He looked horrible. He was gray and everything. It was just...it was so horrible, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "I agree, Peter looks bad. It must have been difficult for you to see  someone you care for so deeply in that state."}, {"instruction": "Oh, it was. He said that Serena wasn't doing anything to him. But I just don't think a person could do that to himself.  I asked what she's been feeding him. But he was like: \"Oh, I don't know...wheatgrass juice and tea.\" Something clicked. I don't know why but I went into the kitchen to hunt down this tea. I found two little jars. Here. These are the jars. The labels are \"Fair Lady\" and \"Thorn Apple.\"", "input": "", "output": "Fair Lady and Thorn Apple? I'm not familiar with these."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, Fair Lady is a name for belladonna. And Thorn Apple is a name for datura.", "input": "", "output": "Belladonna...isn't it also called Deadly Nightshade?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. And both of those herbs, Datura and Belladonna, are poisonous! Serena's been fixing him poison tea! I was furious! Peter heard me fuming and came into the kitchen. I asked him if she put those things in his tea, and he said he thought so. But when I told him what they were, he denied that she put them in his tea. Oh!", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "I was frustrated. I'm still frustrated! But I choked it down and asked Peter to show me her garden.  He did. I couldn't believe it--where in the world she got her stuff? There was Wolf's Bane, more Belladonna and Datura, Black Hellebore, Henbane, Yew and Wormwood. There was probably more than that--I didn't check. All of those plants are poison and most are for inducing astral projection and things like that.  I was astounded and horrified! Where in the world did she get this stuff? Oh, Doctor Balis, do you think there's a law against someone doing stuff like this?", "input": "", "output": "I'm not sure. I know you can't poison someone with impunity."}, {"instruction": "I'll research it.", "input": "", "output": "Would it make you feel better?"}, {"instruction": "If she got arrested? Yes, it would. It would give me some sort of dark satisfaction and it would make me feel better. I'm at the point where I'm willing to fight fire with fire, even if Peter won't stand up for himself. I told him that even if he won't, that I'll try--if only to help him get well. I don't know or care if my intentions are pure.", "input": "", "output": "Wouldn't that violate the rule of three?"}, {"instruction": "Well, probably. But the Goddess always looks out for her children. And I'm willing to face the consequences.", "input": "", "output": "You're willing to take the consequences for Peter's sake?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I guess I am in love.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "But my afternoon didn't end in Serena's infernal garden. We went back inside. I was really emotional. He was upset and asked me not to hurt him. But what could I do? I was hurting him--not on purpose, but as a way to make him see things my way. And that wasn't the only reason I was upset. I ended up admitting how I felt--I told Peter that I wanted him and that I couldn't have him. Then something in my gut kicked in, and the whole fight or flight thing came to mind--I was going to take the flight option. I told Peter I had to go. And--I don't know where he got this energy from--he pursued me and asked me not to leave. He told me that he needs me. So I couldn't leave. Not then. I was crying a little, and he looked like he was so very guilty. I wanted to make it better. And I stayed.", "input": "", "output": "I see. What did you do then?"}, {"instruction": "He asked me to take him somewhere beautiful. I lead him into an astral meditation--I described my grandfather's yard in the summer at sunset. It's so beautiful there. We were finding animals in the clouds. He asked me where we were, and I told him. He was surprised that it was a real place. I told him that whenever the world looks banal and awful to me, I meditate and come back to Grampy's yard. That was my gift to Peter. He wondered why the rest of the world couldn't be like that. I said that if you choose, you can make the world that way. That seemed to be a new concept for him. I couldn't help myself, though...", "input": "", "output": "What?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, don't sound so condescending!", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't."}, {"instruction": "I kissed him on the cheek. He asked me why I did that, and I said that it felt right. He said: \"Does this feel right?\" And he kissed me back. On the lips.", "input": "", "output": "How did that make you feel?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, it was happiness. Pure bliss. And after he kissed me, he said: \"I need you too.\" Oh, I don't think I recall a time when I've been happier. But Serena's impending return made us come back from the astral realm, and we ended the afternoon there.", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like you had a good visit."}, {"instruction": "I did. But I don't think I'm going to get too keyed up about it. There is still Serena to deal with. And I don't know if Peter only needs me because I can get him away from Serena or if Peter actually...I don't know. I'm going to be cautious.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good attitude to take."}, {"instruction": "Well, it helps to be able to know and be aware of my own thoughts.", "input": "", "output": "That's a good first step, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Thanks. I've been needing to hear some sort of affirmation--that I'm doing a good job.", "input": "", "output": "You're doing very well. Keep up the good work."}, {"instruction": "I'll try. Besides seeing Peter, I had to deal with my mom all week. She's gone from being angry to being over-nurturing. She's spoiling me. She keeps a constant eye on me--like she's afraid I'll try to attempt it again.", "input": "", "output": "I've noticed that you call it an \"attempt.\" Why is that?"}, {"instruction": "I don't like to say the word suicide. It's just a black, awful word that only further serves to remind me of what I tried to do. And last time was not the first time I've had those thoughts.", "input": "", "output": "When was the first time?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know, a long time ago. I feel like I've been oscillating in and out of these states of happiness and sadness, happiness and sadness. I've almost sliced my wrists two times before this. I've almost smothered myself under a pillow. I've almost drowned myself. And I've contemplated taking an overdose of pills.", "input": "", "output": "That's a rather long list, Eliza. What stopped you when you were feeling that way?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the \"ow\" factor.", "input": "", "output": "You mean the pain factor?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. I figured it would hurt too much. Gods, Doctor Balis, what's wrong with me?", "input": "", "output": "Here are the tissues. Thinking about taking your own life is very serious..."}, {"instruction": "I took the depression test and scored really high on it.", "input": "", "output": "Oh? Where did you take this test?"}, {"instruction": "I got some materials on depression and things like that. The test was in one of the pamphlets--\"Wakefield Questionnaire\" I think. It scared me to see how large those numbers were.", "input": "", "output": "They are just numbers, Eliza. We are here to make sure that you'll be all right.  It will take time, but I believe that you'll get through this..."}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis, I'm scared. I'm so scared. Every time I think I'm getting better, these feelings come back and gnaw at me like a cancer. I feel like my soul is dying because of these emotions. It's like they rule my world. And I hate it. But I don't feel strong enough to fight it. How in the world can I take care of Peter or anybody else, if I can't take care of myself?", "input": "", "output": "We're all here to help you, Eliza.  But it will take time.  We just have to take it a day at a time.  And there will come a day when you'll wake up and these feeling will be gone and you'll be free to live your life."}, {"instruction": "I'm just scared that one day my emotions will take over, and I will be suppressed--I would turn into the Emotional Bogey-Man.", "input": "", "output": "We won't let that happen, Eliza.  I'm here for you.  And if at any time you feel like these thoughts and emotions are getting the best of you, just call me.  I'll help you be strong and ride those feeling out until the danger's gone.  You don't have to face it alone.  I'm here.  Your parents, your brother, your friends, Peter...we're all here for you, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Oh, Doctor Balis...", "input": "", "output": "Here's more homework for you--here are chapters three and four.  I want you to study these for our next session, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay. You know, I got a dozen roses from Christina this week. I'm going to call her back later today and thank her, but I'm afraid of how she is going to react. But you're right--I do have friends that care about me.", "input": "", "output": "You do.  A lot of people care about you, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "So next week, same time, same place?", "input": "", "output": "Yes.  And if you need me sooner than that, I would be happy to..."}, {"instruction": "Oh, no.  I'm fine, Doctor Balis.  Really.  It's just a momentary weakness.  I'll be all right in a few minutes.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Goodbye, Doctor Balis. Thank you.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye, Eliza. Please call me anytime."}, {"instruction": "Good morning!", "input": "", "output": "You seem to be in a good mood."}, {"instruction": "I am. I quit working for SII today.", "input": "", "output": "That's quite a change..."}, {"instruction": "Working there was only helping promote my state of miserableness. I couldn't take it anymore--it's so banal there. I'm going to work for a metaphysics bookstore.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Are congratulations in order?"}, {"instruction": "They are. I know it's a big change, and that it's going to be hard, but it's for the better. Ben's picking up the insurance to cover me. I have no clue why he's so nice to me, though. I think it's still the same old story, \"I have no kids of my own, so I'm going to spoil my wife's kids.\"", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. When do you start the new job?"}, {"instruction": "The First of August. This new job is the only thing that has held my attention for more than five minutes. It seems like lately I'll get all worked up and jazzed about something only to \"Uh, who cares?\" just a few minutes later.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. Do you feel like this is due to your inability to concentrate, or is it just general disinterest?"}, {"instruction": "A little bit of both, really. Like I said, something holds my interest for about five minutes, and then suddenly I don't care. I mean, damn it, I want to care. But I just can't. I almost didn't get another job to replace SII. My family is doing everything for me now. I feel like I may as well be in a nursing home with someone else feeding me and changing my diapers.", "input": "", "output": "Surely it's not that bad?"}, {"instruction": "It is that bad! And stop calling me Shirley. I'm sorry--a weak attempt at humor.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay. How do you feel about your family taking care of you?"}, {"instruction": "Like they don't have the faith in me to take care of myself. It feels like an insult. Does that make sense?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Eliza, it does make sense."}, {"instruction": "It doesn't help that I feel sad all the time. But at least the sadness doesn't hurt so much right now.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you feel sad?"}, {"instruction": "I feel like I've let them down. Just this overwhelming sense of guilt, and depression, and resentment, and rage...it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.", "input": "", "output": "That's something that we can work on."}, {"instruction": "I know. Do we have to work on it right now? It just makes me sad.", "input": "", "output": "We don't have to work on it right at this moment, if you don't want to."}, {"instruction": "Not right now.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me, Eliza, has your weight changed at all recently?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I'm losing it. I can eat just about anything I want, and then blahh--it's out of my system.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm. You do look like you've lost some weight."}, {"instruction": "It's a good thing. After the accident, I put on pounds like you wouldn't believe. It was awful. I just blimped out. So now, I'm glad I'm losing it. I've always been kind of on the skinny side...or just the regular side. Not the chubby side like I've been lately.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, I like how I'm looking now, actually.", "input": "", "output": "Good. How have you been sleeping?"}, {"instruction": "Poorly. And it's been that way since the accident--what with the nightmares and all.", "input": "", "output": "How often do you have nightmares?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the major one that I told you about?", "input": "", "output": "For example."}, {"instruction": "That one has escalated to once every week. I have others that pop up every now and then, too.", "input": "", "output": "On average, about how much sleep do you get a night?"}, {"instruction": "At any one consecutive time?", "input": "", "output": "Yes."}, {"instruction": "Maybe five hours, tops. The rest of the time I spend tossing and turning trying to get back to sleep.", "input": "", "output": "But you can lay down and fall asleep right away, can't you?"}, {"instruction": "No, I can't. I toss and turn and try to fall asleep. And then I wake back up in the middle of the night with a nightmare or what have you. I just can't take feeling this way anymore!", "input": "", "output": "It's okay, Eliza. Many people experience exactly what you're going through. We're all here to help you."}, {"instruction": "You don't understand! You can't understand! You're not me! It's like I'm being punished for something and I don't know I've done. And it's not fair! Why can't I be happy like everybody else?", "input": "", "output": "Here are the tissues, Eliza. And you're right--I'm not you. But I am here to help you, okay?"}, {"instruction": "Okay.", "input": "", "output": "So how is the reading coming along?"}, {"instruction": "Slowly but surely. I'm doing the exercises. And I've started keeping a journal again, but I don't want to start showing it to you just yet. Okay?", "input": "", "output": "That's okay, Eliza. It's really just to help you clarify your thoughts and feelings."}, {"instruction": "I know. I'm trying, Doctor Balis. I'm trying so hard to get well. But it's so tough. I feel like I'm teetering on the edge of the cliff, knowing that at any moment I can plummet again and trying desperately to prevent that from happening. I don't want to die. I'm scared.", "input": "", "output": "It's going to be okay, Eliza. I can't promise that everything will be easy, but you seem to be making the effort to get well.

Yes, I'm taking it. And my family is making sure of it. Mom has even marked it on the calendar. She bought me a date book and wrote on every day what time I'm supposed to take each medication. It's to the point of ridiculous.", "input": "", "output": "They're just worried about you."}, {"instruction": "I know they are, but I'm not going to be a baby forever. I've got better things to do. I want to go back to school and get a degree. I don't know what kind of degree, but that's not important right now. I want to live on my own. I just want to be an adult for once, instead of my parents' daughter. And I want a fulfilling relationship with someone...it doesn't even necessarily have to be Peter, but I would like that.", "input": "", "output": "Well, it's good that you have some vision of where you want to go."}, {"instruction": "I just hope that hopelessness and despair don't take over.", "input": "", "output": "If you keep working as hard as you have been, I think you can realize your visions."}, {"instruction": "I can only hope that things will get better.", "input": "", "output": "That's a very good attitude, Eliza."}, {"instruction": "Thank you, Doctor Balis.", "input": "", "output": "It looks like we're out of time."}, {"instruction": "No way!", "input": "", "output": "Time flies..."}, {"instruction": "When you're having fun, I know.

Have a good day.", "input": "", "output": "You're welcome, and I'd like you to have a good day, too."}, {"instruction": "Cut the shit, Doctor B, and just listen. I've had a shitty couple of weeks.

Anyhow, Mom kicks me out. After our last session, I come home and all my shit is packed. There are movers outside and they're taking my stuff and putting it onto a van. Of course, I'm curious--I'd like to know what the fuck is going on. Mom is all like, \"I can't deal with you any more. Your negativity wears me down. I need you out of my house. Ben and I got you an apartment. You can stay there. You can have two phone lines. You can spend as much of our money as you want. Just get out.\" My own mother uses the phrase: \"Get out.\" I have never been more hurt in my entire life. It's like she's cut me to the soul. So, of course, I'm bawling as Ben drives me in my car over to my new place. My mother follows in her car to take Ben home. They dump me off and leave me there with the keys to my new apartment. I was crushed. She abandoned me again!", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like..."}, {"instruction": "Then, I got ahold of Peter to give him my new phone number. I ended up seeing him that night, and it went totally screwy. I was so fucked up from my mom and her ranting that I needed him to comfort me. But there he was telling me that I ruined his hopes and aspirations of ever becoming a higher-being. I tried to make it up by kissing him--no response. Then I touched him. I shouldn't have, but I did. I watched my hand aim for his crotch, grab, and squeeze. And I couldn't stop my hand! I didn't know what was going on. He jumped up and started spouting gibberish about something or other, and everything was cold. I thought my mother's rant hurt; this hurt more. I started bawling, and the first thought that popped in my head was \"Run!\" So I ran. And he never came after me. He hates me.

Even my cat hates to be around me--she's run away twice this past week. I ran all over San Francisco screaming at the top of my lungs, \"Guinivere!\" It was humiliating. Now, my mom calls just to remind me to take my medicine. Her voice is like ice. There's no love in it. And Peter...he hasn't done a damn thing since I left. Ever since that night, I've huddled in the corner of my bed bawling. I haven't started work yet. My friend says not to start until I get everything worked out. Apparently, my mom already blocked Dad's and Calypso's numbers off my phone, or else they don't give a shit either.
