Won't you get comfortable?"}, {"instruction": "Should I lie on the couch and make it official?", "input": "", "output": "You can if you wish."}, {"instruction": "Sorry to be sarcastic Doctor.  I just feel a little funny about finding myself in a psychiatrist's office.", "input": "", "output": "I understand.  So why are you here?"}, {"instruction": "Must we get into the heavy stuff right away?  Can't we just talk at first?", "input": "", "output": "I think that would be possible."}, {"instruction": "Maybe I can tell you a little about myself, and you can tell me about yourself.", "input": "", "output": "Well, we're not here to talk about me."}, {"instruction": "Come on, Dr. Balis, tit for tat.  Didn't you see Silence of the Lambs?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, I did.  But please don't confuse me with Hannable Lector."}, {"instruction": "You don't seem anything like him, thank goodness.  Okay, I'm thirty-one years old.  Married.  No kids.", "input": "", "output": "How long have you been married?"}, {"instruction": "We were married in '92 in the Fall.  The ceremony was outdoors at the Marin headlands just beyond the Golden Gate Bridge.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds lovely."}, {"instruction": "It was beautiful.  We said our vows in the afternoon.  The day was clear and sunny, so we could see for miles around.  Then the fog started coming in, wrapping us up in the billowy white.  It felt so magical.  Funny how a simple meteorological  phenomenon can have an almost mystical effect.  Listen to me, I sound like some New Age looney.", "input": "", "output": "No, it just sounds like you have very fond memories of your wedding."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, maybe.", "input": "", "output": "Are you thinking about having children?"}, {"instruction": "Um, sure. One day I'd like to have children.  In fact, my husband has brought up the subject several times.  But, I'm still in the \"one day\" stage, you know?  I love my work, and I just can't see myself giving it all up yet.", "input": "", "output": "Is this becoming a point of conflict between you and your husband?"}, {"instruction": "No.  Not at all.  My husband is very supportive of my career.  Well, maybe a little.", "input": "", "output": "You mean a little conflict?"}, {"instruction": "It's not a big deal in our relationship yet. But I can see where he's coming from.  After all, at thirty-one my clock should be ticking, right?", "input": "", "output": "Do you think it is?"}, {"instruction": "It's hard to say.", "input": "", "output": "Can we talk about why you're here?  Are you experiencing any emotional problems or difficulties?"}, {"instruction": "Can we keep it more general right now, Doctor.  I'm just not comfortable yet.", "input": "", "output": "As you like.  Can you tell me more about your relationship with your husband?"}, {"instruction": "I think our relationship is the healthiest of all of our friends.  Actually, though, that's not saying much.  We almost never fight and, if we do, we talk it out right away.  We made a deal never to go to bed angry.  So far it's working.", "input": "", "output": "You're happy in your marriage then?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.", "input": "", "output": "And your work?  Is it satisfying?"}, {"instruction": "Like I said earlier, I love my work.", "input": "", "output": "What do you do?"}, {"instruction": "I'm a senior graphic artist at SII.", "input": "", "output": "You do a lot of computer graphics work?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, yes.  And there's design.  I get to design characters and backgrounds for some of our games.", "input": "", "output": "Are you getting satisfaction out of your work?"}, {"instruction": "Oh yes.  It's very creative.", "input": "", "output": "How are you getting on with your family?"}, {"instruction": "We are quite close, thank you.", "input": "", "output": "So everything's perfect?"}, {"instruction": "No, of course not.", "input": "", "output": "You make it sound perfect.

The fact is Jack thinks I'm having an affair.", "input": "", "output": "Jack's your husband?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.", "input": "", "output": "Are you having an affair?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "But he doesn't believe you?"}, {"instruction": "Well, he hasn't actually confronted me, but I know that he suspects me.", "input": "", "output": "Why don't you talk to him about it?"}, {"instruction": "This is where it gets complicated.  I can't tell Jack that I'm not having an affair.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "I mean, I would in his place.  He's called my office when I told him that I would be there at a meeting, for example, and was told that I had left for the day.  He had also called in the morning on a couple of occasions, when I should theoretically be there, and no one knew where I was.  In short, my story hasn't always been supported by fact lately.", "input": "", "output": "You mean you've been lying to Jack?"}, {"instruction": "Well, yes.  I've managed up to now to come up with excuses, but it's getting more and more difficult.  He knows me too well not to notice that I'm acting strange when he asks me about these incidents.", "input": "", "output": "Why have you been lying to Jack?"}, {"instruction": "I've been pursuing a hobby.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "It's quite time consuming and Jack doesn't know anything about it.", "input": "", "output": "So what is it?"}, {"instruction": "Well, it's a little unusual, even a little strange, but I'm really into it.", "input": "", "output": "And?"}, {"instruction": "It's dives.", "input": "", "output": "Dives?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, and the people who go to dives.", "input": "", "output": "By dives, you mean bars, strip joints, greasy spoon places...?"}, {"instruction": "Mostly I mean bars, but I've gone into the quarter booth type places too.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you go?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not an alcoholic, if that's what you're trying to imply.", "input": "", "output": "I wasn't implying anything.  I just wanted to understand your hobby.  What is it that you get out of it?  Is it about men?"}, {"instruction": "I've been hit on, but I always turn them away.  I try to be as inconspicuous as possible.  I even change into extra drecky clothes when ever I go, so as to be totally unappealing.", "input": "", "output": "I dare say, Phylis, that I bet it doesn't work."}, {"instruction": "Thank you for the compliment, but you underestimate the length to which I go to become invisible.  When I say drecky, I mean drecky!  Then, I put my hair up in a tight bun, and put on a little bit of stage make-up to to make me look tired and worn out.", "input": "", "output": "You're serious about this.  And you do all this and hang out in a bar in the span of a business meeting?"}, {"instruction": "I've gotten very fast at putting on my disguise.  By now, I can do a total make-over in eight minutes.", "input": "", "output": "So how often do you do this?"}, {"instruction": "I do it about three times a week.", "input": "", "output": "How long has this been going on?"}, {"instruction": "It depends on how you count.  Three times a week for about two months. Before that maybe it was once or occassionally twice a week for about six months or so.  That was easier to hide from Jack, so I did it for some time.  I guess it's been eight or nine months total.", "input": "", "output": "What do you find so interesting about dives?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure.  I've been attracted to them for many years, but I never had the courage to actually step in.  Then I did one time, because I needed a light.  Except that I stayed to smoke my cigarette there.  There weren't very many people, as I recall.  I think there were six in all, including the bartender.  Their faces looked like they were from a Scorsese flick.  I can't quite put it into words.", "input": "", "output": "You're doing fine."}, {"instruction": "They were interesting, that's all.  For no reason, I just felt drawn to them.  Of course, all conversation stopped when I came in.  I disturbed the flow, the routine.  So I left.", "input": "", "output": "But came back?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, eventually.  Then I started to step into more places, the ones I liked, the ones that had that special feel about them.  Soon I figured out how to stand out less, and an actor friend taught me how to apply theater make-up.", "input": "", "output": "Did you tell your friend why you needed this skill?"}, {"instruction": "Sort of. I told him that I was thinking of writing a book, and that I wanted to do a character study.  He thought it was cool.  Later, I told him that I canned the idea because I didn't want word to get back to Jack.  You see, I mentioned my little obsession to him, downplaying it of course, and he thought that I was nuts.  That it was dangerous and that I was going to get myself in trouble.  I couldn't really defend my idea.  If I didn't look out for myself properly, it could have spelled trouble.  So, I never mentioned it again.", "input": "", "output": "Phylis, I think we need to talk more.  Would you be willing to come in again next week?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I better.  We barely got started today.  Time went so fast!", "input": "", "output": "It sometimes seems to."}, {"instruction": "What's one more secret to keep from Frank?", "input": "", "output": "Frank?  I thought your husband's name was Jack."}, {"instruction": "Jack.  That's right.  Jack.  That's what I said.", "input": "", "output": "Oh, you're not going to tell you husband that you were here?"}, {"instruction": "Not unless I could make up another reason as to why I came.  You see why I need you?  My life is getting too complicated for me to handle.  I'm afraid to blow it and give myself away.", "input": "", "output": "Let's schedule something for Monday of next week.  That would be September 9th.  Does that work for you?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, I think I can make that.", "input": "", "output": "How is three o'clock?"}, {"instruction": "Actually, I'd prefer it around lunch time, like this appointment.  There's less explaining to do.", "input": "", "output": "Okay, let's schedule it for Monday, September 9th at noon."}, {"instruction": "Perfect.", "input": "", "output": "One last thing before you go.  Do you write a journal?"}, {"instruction": "No.", "input": "", "output": "Do you doodle?"}, {"instruction": "I draw a lot, sure.", "input": "", "output": "I'd like to see your doodles.  I'd also like you to start writing down some of your thoughts and feelings in a journal."}, {"instruction": "Would it be for you to read?", "input": "", "output": "If you allow me to. It can be a useful tool for our sessions."}, {"instruction": "I'll try, but I'll be really pressed for time.", "input": "", "output": "Just see what you can do."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.  And I'm sorry if I was difficult.", "input": "", "output": "Not at all.  I'll see you next week."}, {"instruction": "Doctor.  It's good to see you.", "input": "", "output": "Please sit down.  How have you been?"}, {"instruction": "I've been under a bit of stress.  You see, I had another close\ncall with Jack.  He was being a real sweetheart and dropped by my work at\naround six, the time I normally go home, to pick me up for a surprise date.\n Just the two of us.  He made reservations at one of our favorite spots.\n He even brought a flower, a single iris with baby's breath.  That was the\nfirst thing that I ever gave him.  He must be the only man on earth with\na memory for such things.  Imagine his surprise when I wasn't there.  They\ntold him that I had left over an hour ago, about the time that I had left\nhim a voice mail saying that I was looking forward to coming home at the\nusual hour.  He gave my flower to the secretary and left.  By the time I\ngot home, he was sitting in front of the T.V. eating a pizza.", "input": "", "output": "I take it that he told you of his plans."}, {"instruction": "Yes.  And of his disappointment too.", "input": "", "output": "What did you tell him?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I was lucky.  On my way home, on an impulse, I stopped\nby a confection-makers to buy Jack's favorite dark chocolate champagne truffles.\n It would've been totally out of the way had I been coming from work, but\nsince I was at one of my dives, it was en route.  I told him that I left\nearly especially to get them for him.", "input": "", "output": "That was lucky."}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  Jack felt guilty for doubting me.  I felt even more guilty\nfor causing him to experience undeserved guilt.  The next day I got a snide\ncomment from the secretary who refused to give me back my flower.", "input": "", "output": "Phylis, you are obviously aware of fact that you stand to lose\nmuch more than a flower unless you clear this up with Jack.  Both of your\nimpulses to treat each other to something special indicate that you both\nfeel the need to pay particular attention to your marriage that you sense\nis in trouble.  Would you agree with that?"}, {"instruction": "Of course I do, Doctor.  That's why I'm here.", "input": "", "output": "Then I would urge you to tell Jack the truth."}, {"instruction": "But I can't!  Weren't you listening last time when I told you\nabout Jack's response to my activities?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, Phylis, I was.  However, it is still my position that dealing\nwith that issue is better than losing a husband that you clearly seem to\nlove, and who, from what little you have told me, seems to love you."}, {"instruction": "I won't give up my excursions.", "input": "", "output": "Nobody is saying that you have to, just yet.  But, perhaps there's\na way of pursuing your hobby in a manner that is less destructive to your\nmarriage."}, {"instruction": "Do you really think that's possible?", "input": "", "output": "It's entirely in your hands.  You must express to Jack just\nhow important these excursions are to you."}, {"instruction": "Alternatively, I was rather hoping that you would help me to\ndevise a system for keeping information straight in my head.  A trick or\na technique that I could utilize.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that it would be possible or even desirable to\ncontinue with your deception for a prolonged period of time?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure, but I don't think that I'm ready to have this conversation\nwith Jack just yet.  I would like to be able to present a reasonable argument\nas to why I'm doing this.  It would also be nice to be able to tell Jack\nthat I need X amount of time after which I would be done.  But I'm not willing\nto set such limits.  What if I'm never satiated?", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that it's necessary to rationalize your desires\nto Jack?"}, {"instruction": "This has become more than a simple desire.  It's now a necessity.\n But to answer your question, I prefer to have a sound, logical basis for\nmy actions.  That's way I want to justify my actions to myself as well as\nto others.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps we can try to get at some of the reasons why this hobby\nhas become so important to you during our therapy sessions.  Have you begun\nthat journal that we discussed last time?"}, {"instruction": "No, I just haven't had the time.  But I've thought about it.\n Would it be useful for you to see some of the places that I've been spending\ntime in?", "input": "", "output": "Do you mean go there?"}, {"instruction": "Oh no.  I wouldn't want to bring you along.  I'm talking about\nphotographs.  I could start a roll of film and take some pictures of these\nplaces.  It would only be outdoors, of course.  I don't want to upset anyone\nthere. But at least it would be something.", "input": "", "output": "That could be interesting.  Would you write down comments next\nto the photos describing your thoughts as you are about to enter or as you\nare leaving?"}, {"instruction": "You don't give up easily, do you Doctor?", "input": "", "output": "Would you like me to give up?"}, {"instruction": "No, I guess not.", "input": "", "output": "Okay.  Could you talk a little about your attraction to dives?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not sure what to say.", "input": "", "output": "Just tell me the first thing that comes to mind when you think\nof the last place that you went."}, {"instruction": "That would be my work.", "input": "", "output": "But we are not here to discuss your work or are we?"}, {"instruction": "No, I'm sorry.  My defense shields fly up just thinking about\ntalking to someone about this.", "input": "", "output": "Why do you think that is?"}, {"instruction": "I guess it's because this is so personal.  I've even thought\nthat the reason why I'm not able to explain it to myself is that I don't\nwant to face or acknowledge it.", "input": "", "output": "We can go slow and take it one step at a time.  What's the most\ncommon thing that you feel as you think about going out to a dive?"}, {"instruction": "Excitement.  If it's a place that I've gone to before, I often\ncan't wait to get there.  I know what to expect at least to some degree.\n There are specific people that I've befriended and want to see again. \nI start to know something about each one and their stories continue to unfold\nto me.  Sometimes I'll buy them a drink.  But not too often or they won't\nrelate to me as one of their own.  I'll appear too rich or something.", "input": "", "output": "Do you tend to go to familiar places?"}, {"instruction": "Generally, yes.  That is until I get that explorer feeling.", "input": "", "output": "Explorer feeling?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  It's a desire to discover a new hideaway, as if the ones\nthat I've been frequenting have become too familiar.  You know, if people\nget too used to you, they stop talking to you.  At least they don't tell\nyou quite so much anymore.  When you're new, they try talking you up to\nout do each other's stories.  That's when it's the most interesting.", "input": "", "output": "Do you just listen?  Or do you tell stories too?"}, {"instruction": "Good question.  I didn't expect you to ask that.", "input": "", "output": "Does that mean that you do?"}, {"instruction": "Yes.  I have developed something of a persona over time.  Her\nname is Martha and she has a definite personal history.  It's mostly made\nup, but I try to stick with one story so as not to forget what I had said.", "input": "", "output": "Have you always approached it this way?"}, {"instruction": "No.  In fact, there are some places that I don't go back to anymore\nbecause I don't remember the stories that I told there.  I wouldn't want\npeople to think that I was lying.  I doubt if anyone remembers and I could\nalways say that I was drunk and thus taking liberties, but why get into\nsuch a mess?", "input": "", "output": "I would like to hear more about Martha, but I'm afraid we are\nrunning short on time.  In the meantime..."}, {"instruction": "I know, try to write something in my journal or at least get\none.", "input": "", "output": "Well, that would be nice.  However, what I was going to say\nis that you should think about approaching this subject with Jack.  Just\nimagine how the conversation would go and see what you would say."}, {"instruction": "I've tried that.  That conversation inevitably ends in a scandal\nwith me storming out of the house.", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps you could try to imagine that you don't storm out of\nthe house.  That instead, you stayed and continued to talk about it.  I\nwould like to hear what you imagine happens next."}, {"instruction": "Okay, but I have to tell you, I don't think that I could master\nthe patience to stay.", "input": "", "output": "Shall we make an appointment for the same time next week?"}, {"instruction": "Next Monday at noon?  Let me check my schedule.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, if that works for you.  Monday, the 16th of September,\nat 12:00 noon."}, {"instruction": "I can make that.", "input": "", "output": "Great.  Then I shall see you next Monday."}, {"instruction": "Monday it is.  Have a nice week, Dr. Balis.", "input": "", "output": "And you, Phylis.  Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Ms. Birch?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, it's me.", "input": "", "output": "Phylis, that's quite a transformation."}, {"instruction": "I just thought it'd be fun for you to see Martha since we started\nto talk about her last week.", "input": "", "output": "I'm interested. Now I know what you were describing. It is a\nvery convincing disguise."}, {"instruction": "I thought perhaps we could go through this session with Martha\ninstead of with me.", "input": "", "output": "Certainly, as you like."}, {"instruction": "I don't do accents or dialects or anything. In fact, I use some\nreal experiences of mine to fill out her story. But for the most part she,\nI mean this me, is a separate person.", "input": "", "output": "So tell me something about this self."}, {"instruction": "I'm divorced and have a thirteen year old daughter Emily who\nis currently living with her father in Minnesota. I left the Midwest when\nI was twenty-two. My husband and I split up. We got split custody of the\ngirl, but he had money and I didn't. I couldn't give her a good, stable\nhome, so I resigned to letting her father bring her up as he pleased. I\nmoved to Boston for awhile because I knew some people there, then I came\nhere. I haven't seen my Emily in eight years. At first I would call and\nvisit, but soon visiting got too expensive, so I was coming less and less\noften. Not that I didn't want to. I always wanted to. Finally, her father\nasked me not to call so much (once a week or so), saying that it was affecting\nEmily in bad way. That he was seeing someone, and that he wanted for this\nwoman to have a chance to be close to her. Maybe even a family. I wanted\nwhat was best for my daughter, so I agreed to call just twice a month. But\nwhen I did call he wouldn't let us talk for very long, or tell me that she\nwas sleeping or something. With time, he asked me to stop calling all together\nbecause it was confusing the child. I was furious, but didn't know what\nto do. I couldn't come and get her, though I thought about it often, and\nshe seemed to be doing well without me. Slowly, I let him pressure me into\ncutting off all contact. However I do have a P.O. Box that he writes to\nonce a month to keep me current on Emily's life. That was the deal, you\nsee.", "input": "", "output": "That's quite specific. Do you usually tell your story all at\nonce?"}, {"instruction": "No, rarely so. It generally comes up one tid bit at a time.", "input": "", "output": "Does Martha miss Emily?"}, {"instruction": "Very much. She says a prayer for her every night.", "input": "", "output": "What about her ex-husband? Does he have a name?"}, {"instruction": "No. Uh, I never gave him a name.", "input": "", "output": "That's interesting, considering how detailed the rest of your\nstory is."}, {"instruction": "Well, you're referring to Martha as me only because we're playing\nthis game, right? You understand that Martha is a character that I made\nup in order to keep my real life separate.", "input": "", "output": "Of course. So, why would you not invent a name for Martha's\nex-husband? Hasn't it ever come up?"}, {"instruction": "It has but I always managed to change the subject. You see, I'm\nafraid that if I were to give him a name, I might slip and use it instead\nof Jack. That would be extremely suspicious.", "input": "", "output": "Probably so, yes."}, {"instruction": "You know Dr. Balis, since I'm all made and everything, I would\nlike to cut our session short this week and stop by a local place before\nheading back to the office.", "input": "", "output": "We've only just started these sessions, Phylis.  I think it\nwould be inappropriate for you to leave in the middle.  We have over twenty\nminutes left."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry Doctor, but it's something I feel I must do.  I'm already\nin the make-up and everything.  I do hope you'll understand.", "input": "", "output": "Look, ultimately it's your call. But don't do this again.  I'm\nnot to become the excuse that you use to hang out in bars.  Can you come\nagain on Friday, the 20th?  Say around noon?"}, {"instruction": "Let's see. I have a lunch date with Jack. What about after work?", "input": "", "output": "I can't make that. How about this same time next Monday, the\n23rd of September.  Will that still work for you?"}, {"instruction": "Yom Kippur. Okay. See you then.", "input": "", "output": "Do eat something Phylis. Alcohol on an empty stomach and then\nback to work..."}, {"instruction": "I will. I will. I know how to look after myself.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye then."}, {"instruction": "Hello Doctor. Sorry for the surprise last week.", "input": "", "output": "Are you talking about Martha or leaving early?"}, {"instruction": "Martha, but I take it you were not very happy with me for leaving early.", "input": "", "output": "Let's just say that I wouldn't like you to do that again. After all, we are trying to work through some of your problems."}, {"instruction": "I appreciate that. It was simply too tempting.", "input": "", "output": "So how was your visit to the local place?"}, {"instruction": "Thank you for not asking the name. I'd like to keep that information to myself. Frankly it was a little disappointing. Nobody that I had ever met was there. Even the bartender was new, apparently the woman who used to be there was fired for stealing from the register.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "That's what the new bartender told me.", "input": "", "output": "Did you talk about anything else?"}, {"instruction": "The weather. You know, nothing in particular. I was more interested in listening to other conversations, or should I say waiting for other conversations to happen.", "input": "", "output": "It was rather quiet then?"}, {"instruction": "Yes. Then some kids came in and I left. I had to get back to work anyway.", "input": "", "output": "Tell me more about Martha. How long has she existed?"}, {"instruction": "The name I've used from the very beginning, ever since I started to do the stage make-up. My friend, the one who taught me how to apply it, wanted some inspiration the first time that he made me up--a name that he could work towards. I came up with Martha on the fly and it stuck.", "input": "", "output": "What about the persona?"}, {"instruction": "That I filled in over time.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever known anyone like her?"}, {"instruction": "Not exactly. One of my roommates in college was adopted, and she hired a detective to find her birth mother. The woman turned out to be an alcoholic, not doing much with her life. This woman, whose name I don't remember anymore, was from the mid-west. She had my roommate when she was eighteen and gave her up when my roommate was three years old. She wanted a new chance at life, she told Jessy. That was my roommate's name--Jessy. This woman had a P.O. box that Jessy's parents agreed to write progress reports to, but I guess she fell behind on her payments or something, because the letters started to come back. At least that's what Jessy's parents claimed happened. The woman, the birth mother, didn't want anything to do with Jessy. They met once in a bar, talked for a couple of hours, and as far as I know, never saw or spoke to each other again. Martha is loosely based on this woman's story.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Did Jessy ever find her natural father?"}, {"instruction": "No. She only found out that his name was Frank.", "input": "", "output": "Let's get back to you. Have you thought about talking to Jack about what you've been doing?"}, {"instruction": "Well, the crisis seems to have passed for now. I have been more careful about when I go. I try to be less spontaneous and plan in advance instead. That's helped. I've also tried to be more attentive to Jack and to our relationship, and I think that's having a reassuring effect on Jack.", "input": "", "output": "And what effect is it having on you?"}, {"instruction": "I feel like things are a little more in control now. I'm less anxious.", "input": "", "output": "So you plan to continue keeping Martha a secret?"}, {"instruction": "I just don't want to upset Jack unless I absolutely have to.", "input": "", "output": "Then being secretive is entirely for the benefit of your husband, or are there more reasons?"}, {"instruction": "It's mainly for Jack's benefit, but I confess that I like having a secret life.", "input": "", "output": "Do you see it as something romantic? Something out of a novel?"}, {"instruction": "A little. I sometimes imagine having a biography written about me. That is, if I do something extraordinary in my life that would warrant one. And then I imagine reading it. Up to now, it would be pretty boring.", "input": "", "output": "And Martha makes it more interesting?"}, {"instruction": "Don't you think so?", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps. But then again, I'm a psychiatrist."}, {"instruction": "Yeah, well there's that.", "input": "", "output": "Do you really think that's the real reason for the bars and for Martha? To make your life appear more interesting?"}, {"instruction": "It's more complicated than that. That alone would be stupid.", "input": "", "output": "Not stupid Phylis, but you have to carefully consider whether is is really worth enough to jeopardize your marriage."}, {"instruction": "I repeat, this is not the only reason for my doing any of this.", "input": "", "output": "What would you say is another?"}, {"instruction": "You're the psychiatrist, maybe you can tell me?", "input": "", "output": "I am the psychiatrist, but I think that you have more information on this matter than I."}, {"instruction": "Can't I just like it? Can't I just have a taste for the dark side?", "input": "", "output": "Would it be fair to say that through Martha you are exploring your own dark side?"}, {"instruction": "Well naturally to some extent I am. But I think of it more as getting a glimpse into other people's lives. People that I otherwise would never get to meet. And it isn't that they are so different from the people I interact with in my daily life as Phylis, it's that they have different problems. Different problems and a different perspective on things. Not necessarily a healthy one, but there is always a logic to it, often a twisted logic. The trick is getting into a mind frame where you can easily follow it, where it starts to make sense. I think I have grown a lot through this experience. When I strip myself of the mind that I am used to and make room for Martha, I am able to sympathize without feeling pity. There's compassion, but it's eye to eye. My having a statistically successful life--marriage, my career--no longer gets in the way of humility. It's funny, I'm even becoming more politically-minded nowadays.", "input": "", "output": "How so?"}, {"instruction": "Just in terms of issues that I support, and sometimes even speak out on.", "input": "", "output": "I see. Have you ever considered the fact that while you adjust your thinking to be more in line with the people that you're meeting, and thus encourage an uninhibited discourse, you are blatantly deceiving them?"}, {"instruction": "You have such a way with words.", "input": "", "output": "It wasn't meant as an affront."}, {"instruction": "I know. That makes it worse. What I do, I do without malicious intent. Furthermore, I do not believe that I cause harm unintentionally. I simply make myself less threatening in their eyes.", "input": "", "output": "Does that include Martha's personal history?"}, {"instruction": "Yes it does. When people think that I am worse off, then they are more likely to have a real conversation with me. It's a kind of ice breaker.", "input": "", "output": "What reaction do you suppose you would get from your new friends..."}, {"instruction": "Acquaintances.", "input": "", "output": "Very well, acquaintances--if they were to find out your true identity?"}, {"instruction": "First, they never will. Second...what's the point of this? It will never happen.", "input": "", "output": "The point is in order for you to able to start reconciling your two disparate faces, you will need to be able to answer such questions to yourself.

Now I just have to break it in but hopefully it's not going to be too bad.", "input": "", "output": "Hopefully."}, {"instruction": "I've also had a rather disturbing experience at Wi... at a bar that I've been going to for quite a while.  Incidentally, it was my only outing this week because of the chaos at work.", "input": "", "output": "Okay."}, {"instruction": "I met a young woman who apparently has been going there for months.  We've managed to always just miss each other.  She's sort of punky--blue highlights in her hair and stuff.  She was bright and articulate, despite the fact that she was nursing her third Rum and Coke.  She said that she has a degree from the University of Texas in International Relations.  She's been out of school for two years, works in Noah's Bagels, and hates her life.  It was so frustrating to hear her story.", "input": "", "output": "More so than other stories you've heard?"}, {"instruction": "In a way.  Most people that I strike up conversations with, or they with me, are older.  They have their troubles but there's usually a long string of events that has lead them to the point where they are now.  Some are vets, some are wives of vets, some have had run-ins with the law.  All kinds of stories are out there but I rarely get to be present for the beginning of the fall.  It's devastating.", "input": "", "output": "What makes you believe that she's at the beginning of a fall and not on the verge of getting out of her situation?"}, {"instruction": "For one thing, she comes off as depressed and defeated.  It's hard to make good things happen when you have given up trying.  For another, she was on her third drink at four in the afternoon.", "input": "", "output": "There's that.

She works for four days in a row, then drinks for two, and dries out on the last day before starting the cycle anew.", "input": "", "output": "What did you say to her?"}, {"instruction": "Well, I didn't really know what to say.  I never expected to meet her.  She didn't fit the mold, if there's such a thing.  She was too green.  I wanted to help her snap out of it.  Nobody goes to college, especially one as reputable as University of Texas, to work in a bagel shop.  She still owed tons of money on her student loans.  God, I'm glad that I never took any out!  Anyway, I didn't know how to make her see things differently.  I didn't stay long.  I came home early, sat on the couch, and waited for Jack to come home as I stared out of the window.  I really wanted to tell him about this girl.  I don't know why, hers is certainly not the most tragic story I've ever heard but it got to me.  Maybe because when I got out of college I drifted for a while.  Things were different then.  I was confident that I would make it even when I didn't know in what capacity.", "input": "", "output": "Does this woman remind you of yourself some years back?"}, {"instruction": "In a way.", "input": "", "output": "Well if she has your determination, she'll make it."}, {"instruction": "How can you be so callous?", "input": "", "output": "She really shook you up, didn't she?  Is this the first time that you got so emotionally involved with a person that you've met in this context?"}, {"instruction": "It's been a while, but I used to be quite affected when I first started to do this.  I guess I wasn't as good at keeping my shield up then.  But this spun me for a loop.", "input": "", "output": "What is it about her that you're reacting to so strongly?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe its her eyes.", "input": "", "output": "Her eyes?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, she had very intense eyes.  I generally make a point of looking at the person's eyes when we speak.  But with her I had to pull free of her gaze, almost as if she would swallow me up if I didn't.  I've only felt that from men before.  Usually slimos who are trying to get up my skirt, so to speak.  This wasn't like that.  She didn't seem to want anything from me other than my attention at the moment.", "input": "", "output": "What else did you notice?"}, {"instruction": "Well, she was soft spoken though that could have been the alcohol.  She was unusually up front.", "input": "", "output": "About what?"}, {"instruction": "Everything.  Her situation, her state of mind, everything.  She made no bones about anything.", "input": "", "output": "Maybe she had nothing to hide, especially from someone she met in a bar."}, {"instruction": "Maybe, but it's usually not like that.  People will ration out their stories, make them a bit more colorful too.  Not her though.  She answered me simply and it was the naked truth.  Something else was striking about her eyes.  One was different from the other.  Her right eye was green and her left one was gray.", "input": "", "output": "When did you meet?"}, {"instruction": "We met last Friday.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that you'll meet again?"}, {"instruction": "I never know in these cases.  She says she's a regular.  So I'll try to catch her at the same time this week.  If I'm lucky, she'll be there.", "input": "", "output": "What do you hope to gain by seeing her again?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not hoping to gain anything.  I would like to talk more with her, that's all.  You men always think in terms of losses and gains.", "input": "", "output": "Your husband too?"}, {"instruction": "Oh the lot of you in my opinion.", "input": "", "output": "That's a pretty strong opinion.  You're full of strong opinions today."}, {"instruction": "And what if I am?  Jack's always talking to me about my \"strong convictions.\"  I say, if a man can't handle a woman with a little back bone, he should marry a slug.", "input": "", "output": "Now that's an appealing suggestion."}, {"instruction": "Thank you.  I aim to please.", "input": "", "output": "Indeed but whom?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis!", "input": "", "output": "Yes?"}, {"instruction": "You're out to get me today.", "input": "", "output": "No Phylis.  I'm just trying to understand you and to help you understand yourself.  Does Jack often try to pressure you to be something that you are not?"}, {"instruction": "He's not too bad.  But admittedly, when I'm tired or stressed, I've noticed that I'm somewhat less flexible.  The double life thing is quite draining.  I know I should tell Jack.", "input": "", "output": "It would take some pressure off of you.  Though there will undoubtedly be new tensions for a period until you and Jack iron things out."}, {"instruction": "But bringing Jack into this means compromising.  And I don't feel like compromising on this one.", "input": "", "output": "That's true.  However, you have the advantage of opening up the negotiations.  That's a clear indication that you're trying."}, {"instruction": "That's a good point.  So by talking about it and disclosing my secret, I'm taking the first step.", "input": "", "output": "Exactly."}, {"instruction": "So then it would be Jack's turn.", "input": "", "output": "Yes, except that you were the one lying to him."}, {"instruction": "For a moment there it sounded really good.  Why does it sound so awful again?", "input": "", "output": "Perhaps you put yourself in Jack's place and didn't like what you saw?"}, {"instruction": "I know that what I'm doing is a little out of the ordinary.  But that's why he married me, because I'm not ordinary.", "input": "", "output": "Do you think that that is why he fell in love with you?"}, {"instruction": "It better be part of it.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "It did have a lot to do with it.  Dr. Balis, I'm not a miserable bitch to my husband.  I love Jack.  I do a lot to make certain that he is happy and satisfied with our marriage.  But I know him.  He wouldn't understand my passion for going to places with questionable appearances and reputations.  I've not even managed to convince you of their appeal and you're a neutral party.  More then neutral, you're paid to listen to me.  You're my therapist!  And that would also take a lot of explaining.", "input": "", "output": "I don't think that you are a bitch, Phylis.

Same time next week okay?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, October 7th.  But I might take you up on your offer and call.", "input": "", "output": "That's fine.  I'll be here.  Or else leave a message and I'll get back to you right away."}, {"instruction": "Thanks.", "input": "", "output": "Sure.  Goodbye Phylis."}, {"instruction": "It's good to see you, Dr. Balis.", "input": "", "output": "It is indeed good to have you back.  What's been going on?"}, {"instruction": "Oh, it seems like all this happened so long ago.", "input": "", "output": "All this?"}, {"instruction": "Yes, that awful night that Jack came to take me home.", "input": "", "output": "Take you home from where?"}, {"instruction": "I guess I should start at the beginning.", "input": "", "output": "Please."}, {"instruction": "On Thursday, the 3rd of October, I went out to a little place in the Tenderloin that I had never been to before.  I sat down, ordered a gin and tonic, and immediately some guy started talking to me.  It was like I was fresh blood or something.  Anyway, as he's chatting me up, Jack walks in.  Apparently he's been following me--it just took a few minutes for him to work up his courage to actually confront me.  I didn't see him at first with this creep bugging me.  He comes over to me and in a cold and steady voice tells me to get my bag and that we're leaving.  I was startled and shocked to see him.  I hesitated.  For a moment I thought that I should pretend not to know him, maybe he'd believe me and leave.  But his eyes were so stormy.  There was a lot of pain there.  So I reached for my pack and followed him out.  As we were walking away, the creepo that was talking to me kept calling after us.  Then he rushed after us, asking Jack who he was and me whether I knew him.  Jack used the \"wrong\" name--he called me Phylis and, of course, I was Martha to the creep.  I was too scared and too shocked to say anything.  I just looked at him.  Jack didn't bother to reply.  Sometimes he's like that.  If it is insignificant and bothersome, he simply won't respond.  That's when the creepo jumped him.  He beat Jack to a bloody pulp before Jack even knew what was happening.  By that point I was incapable of dealing.  I was incapable of thinking.  I could barely believe that any of this was happening.  So now my husband is lying unconscious on the sidewalk.  It's late, maybe ten thirty.  There are no cops to be had.  Who knows where they were, all hanging out over donuts.  The creepo, he told me his name was Joe, takes me back to his place.  I felt as if I was watching a movie--that none of this was actually happening.  When we got to the rat hole that this guy calls home, he washed my face and gave me something to drink.  I can't quite remember how I got to the next point, I guess I blocked it out, but this slime was on top of me.  My clothes were mostly gone and his dick was between my legs.  I freaked out, pushed him off, and scrambled to get my jeans.  He asked where I was going, but I didn't answer.  All I could think about was Jack, lying there in the filth bleeding.  I ran out to find him.  When I got to the place, Jack was still unconscious.  I called for an ambulance and we went to the emergency room.  He looked real bad.  Blood was all over his face.  When he finally came to, he could hardly move.  This Joe creep had broken three of Jack's ribs, his nose, and his right leg.  He was in a shit load of pain.", "input": "", "output": "Oh Phylis."}, {"instruction": "They kept him in the hospital for two days because of internal hemorrhaging.  I stayed there with him.", "input": "", "output": "Were you all right?  Are you all right?"}, {"instruction": "The emergency waiting area was horrible.  Drug addicts and alcoholics shivering in cold sweat.  Gun shot wounds.  Motorcycle accident victims.  There were tons of motorcycle accident victims being brought in one after another.  The river of cripples kept flowing.  Jack did not have to wait because of the internal bleeding but I did.  I swear I lost years of my life sitting there.  Watching.  I remember that for a moment I thought of some of the people that I had gotten to know as Martha.  Most of them had had the occasion to wait in an emergency ward.  But primarily I was scared.  Scared for Jack, scared for us, or just plain scared.  I'm still scared.  But at least I know that Jack is going to be fine.  With one less tooth but fine.", "input": "", "output": "Is he still on bed rest?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah.  He isn't supposed to go anywhere for at least two weeks.", "input": "", "output": "And what about you?  Are you going to work or staying home with Jack?"}, {"instruction": "I took most of last week off, but as of today I'm back.  I can't afford to stay away for so long.

I'm going through the motions but...well, let's just say that I could stand to get a little more productive.", "input": "", "output": "You must know that I am less worried about your productivity at work than I am about your well being, both physically and emotionally."}, {"instruction": "I don't quite know what to say.  I am trying real hard to hold strong, so that I can be there for Jack.  I got him into this after all.  I haven't told him what he missed while he was unconscious.  I'm not sure that I ever will.  As for Martha, I've got some explaining to do.", "input": "", "output": "Are you all right?  You went through some pretty horrific things."}, {"instruction": "I don't know.

I had this meeting that I just couldn't get out of.", "input": "", "output": "I understand."}, {"instruction": "Dr. Balis, I've been just terrible to everyone.

Take your time."}, {"instruction": "You don't know the half of it. I can't sleep. I'm a walking zombie. I haven't had sex with Jack since the incident, forget about making love! We used to do it every day! He shows some interest, but I just can't. I see that monster's face everywhere. Today I thought that I saw him at SII. I'm going crazy. I fantasize about what I would do to him if I ever saw him. Then I start thinking that he did nothing wrong, that I encouraged him to fuck me. And Jack...I still haven't told him anything about what actually happened. He believes that I never left his side, that I took care of him, as a loving wife would have done. I must be a sadist, or a stone to leave him bleeding in the gutter. Who knows what could have happened to him? I don't know what did happen. Did some drunk come along and kick him some more? Or worse? Or what if he woke up at some point and called for me and I wasn't there? What if he's keeping something from me? Maybe he hates me and is biding his time for cold vengeance. He would be perfectly in the right, you know. I deserve everything he can do to me.", "input": "", "output": "Phylis slow down.

It's like these excursions were sucking at my very soul, but I love it. I think I might even go tonight. Martha is calling me. Sometimes I hear her talking to me, whispering. She's there when I lie awake at night. She talks me out of wanting Jack. When she's in my head, I look at him with complete indifference.

He never mentioned that night again.", "input": "", "output": "Have you?"}, {"instruction": "I brought it up a couple of times, but he dodged the issue--some pain would suddenly get worse.

I'm only prescribing 20 pills because I don't want you to become dependent on them.  Now you mentioned that you've been haunted by the face of your attacker, let's talk about that."}, {"instruction": "I must tell you that I'm a little overwhelmed right now. It's difficult to keep my thoughts straight and I have to go back to work after this. Shit.", "input": "", "output": "It's okay. Don't worry, it'll get better. We'll go slow.

Just tell me the parts you remember."}, {"instruction": "Well, I had this one dream where I was in a different time. In retrospect, it's like a scene out of the life of Jack the Ripper. Old streets, definitely not in California. It's dark, late at night. I'm walking down the street or more like an alley and man in a black cloak grabs me and drags me away. Only when we go around the corner of some house, to where the garbage bins are at their most pungent, the man turns his face to the light-- a yellow street light--it's me in the cloak. I look down to see who the victim is and it's that Joe guy. The next thing that I remember is me striking him with a knife over and over again. But he won't die. I can remember the feeling, the adrenalin rush from stabbing him. It's exciting even now to think about it. But there was also fear and panic. I remember the panic of not being able to kill him. The fear that someone will find me. That's when Jack appears in the shadows. He watches me silently then approaches. At that point the cloaked figure becomes Joe again. He strikes at Jack with the bloody knife and Jack falls to the ground. The last thing that I remember is standing over Jack's body with the knife in my hand alone.", "input": "", "output": "So what do you think this dream means?"}, {"instruction": "Actually I was hoping that you could tell me.", "input": "", "output": "I could try to analyze it, but that would be much less illuminating than if you talked your way through it."}, {"instruction": "Well okay. I definitely see Joe as a threat to both Jack and myself. But that's obvious. Maybe the cloak was a symbol of evil and since both Joe and I wore the cloak I'm ambivalent as to who is actually the bad guy in my life, Joe or myself.", "input": "", "output": "It does sound that way to me. But you were also a victim in your dream."}, {"instruction": "Yeah. A victim turned aggressor.", "input": "", "output": "What else does this dream mean to you?"}, {"instruction": "Perhaps the stench and the darkness demonstrate the ugliness of what happened that night. It definitely occurred on the dark side of town, on the dark side of my life.", "input": "", "output": "Do you recall how Jack looked?"}, {"instruction": "Let me think. Yes, he also wore black. What does that mean? Do I think that Jack is equally evil? But he was the only real victim!", "input": "", "output": "Is that what you really feel?"}, {"instruction": "You think I blame Jack? That's horrible. I'm horrible.", "input": "", "output": "You're not horrible. If you were, you wouldn't care so much. But perhaps there is a part to this story that has to do with Jack. Maybe he is at the heart of your obsession with bars and the dark side of life."}, {"instruction": "I know that nothing is ever black and white, but my little habit is mine. It's my idea. It's my sickness. Jack has nothing to do with it. I wish he had, in fact. But he doesn't.", "input": "", "output": "Are you resentful about that?"}, {"instruction": "Maybe. He didn't have to be so god damn straight--so kosher.", "input": "", "output": "There is definitely some hostility there."}, {"instruction": "Had he been willing to explore with me--though it would have been much different and I think not as good--none of this would ever have happened. Oh god. It sounds like I'm blaming Jack. I am blaming Jack. That's outrageous! All that Jack was doing, the wonderful man, was looking out for the well-being of his wife. Well that's not entirely true. He was spying on me. He followed me to the bar and tried to force me to go home with him. How dare he? The nerve. I'm my own woman, thank you. I don't need to be told what to do and what not to do. On the other hand, I kept it a secret. Naturally he was worried. He's right. Anything could have happened. And it did. I was raped. Well not exactly. He probably didn't see it that way. He probably thought that he was saving me from some lunatic. How gallant. I hate it. They both tried to save me. Great. Fucking men.", "input": "", "output": "Phylis I know this is bad-timing, but my other patient will be here any minute. I could meet with you again tonight, if you like."}, {"instruction": "No forget it. I can't make it tonight. I'll just see you on Monday. Noon is still okay?", "input": "", "output": "Noon is perfect.  I know that you probably don't want to hear this right now, but I really have to urge you to get checked out by your gynecologist?"}, {"instruction": "Checked out--you mean for AIDs?", "input": "", "output": "Well, for AIDs and for other possible sexually transmitted diseases.  It's been two weeks, so the tests would be able to show something if it was there.  I don't want to alarm you, but I don't think you would feel good about yourself if you transmitted something unknowingly to Jack."}, {"instruction": "What would you suggest I get checked for?", "input": "", "output": "Unfortunately, gynecologists do this way too often.  They know exactly what to check for."}, {"instruction": "Shit.  That sounds like good advice.  I better go. Thanks for talking to me.", "input": "", "output": "Call me if you want to, anytime.  And let me know how the Halcion works."}, {"instruction": "I'll be fine. Don't worry. See you Monday.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Phylis."}, {"instruction": "Hi Dr. Balis.", "input": "", "output": "Hello Phylis. Please come in. I've been waiting for you."}, {"instruction": "But I'm on time, even with the time change!", "input": "", "output": "I simply meant that I've been anxious to talk to you. How are you?"}, {"instruction": "I'm much better, thank you. The sleeping pills are working wonders.", "input": "", "output": "Good. I'm glad."}, {"instruction": "Remember I mentioned that I was doing some sketches of people that I met at my dives?", "input": "", "output": "I do."}, {"instruction": "Well perhaps I could tell you something about them now.", "input": "", "output": "Sure, if you would like."}, {"instruction": "For starters, do you recall a young woman that I'd mentioned to you a few sessions ago, before the mess, that I was getting kind of close to?  The one from The Blue... from one of my haunts?", "input": "", "output": "Yes, you identified with her quite a bit as I recall."}, {"instruction": "That's right. One of the sketches is of her. It's from memory of course, so it's quite a bit off, but it will give you a sense of her. She is very compelling. I find myself thinking about regularly. I miss her in some strange way. Not in the way one would miss someone close, but her manner of speech, her voice. I hope she's okay.", "input": "", "output": "Are there other portraits among your drawings?"}, {"instruction": "I made a sketch of the bartender from the place where I used to meet the girl. Some drawings are so personal that I don't even think I can talk to you about them.", "input": "", "output": "Hmm."}, {"instruction": "Some of my drawings I don't even let Jack see.", "input": "", "output": "Have you made any drawings relating to Jack?"}, {"instruction": "Some of them are about Jack. But mostly I don't show my drawing to Jack because I don't want him to get the wrong idea about me. He can be a little on the conservative or, perhaps better put, conventional side sometimes. Don't get me wrong--Jack can be real quirky and offbeat. It's just that sometimes his proper upbringing gets the better of him and I never know when that side of him is going rear its ugly head.", "input": "", "output": "Have you ever discussed that with Jack?"}, {"instruction": "I should say that I'm hardly in a position to complain about him!", "input": "", "output": "But perhaps you can talk to Jack about these feelings. I think they might be in part the reason for your obsession with the darker side. Mind you, I'm not suggesting that there might not be other reasons completely independent from Jack."}, {"instruction": "I guess you have hit upon something that I've been trying not to think about. I don't want to become as straight as Jack by osmosis. I somehow feel that I need to reaffirm my world outside of the nine to five and husband in the burbs. When I started going to all these places, it was in part out of curiosity and in part because it was taboo. Young women just aren't \"supposed to\" go to places like that if they know what's good for them. Men can go.  They'll be safe.  For them it's just a little drink or thrill. But for a woman...anyway, I think that sucks. I know how to look out for myself. I wouldn't do anything stupid. Well I wouldn't if somebody wouldn't interfere. There I go blaming Jack again. Poor Jack, he should leave me.", "input": "", "output": "Do you want him to leave you?"}, {"instruction": "He wouldn't leave me. He worships the ground I walk on. It sounds conceited, but it's true. Jack is very proud of being my husband. I'm proud to be his wife too, but it's not the same.", "input": "", "output": "So would you like him to leave you?"}, {"instruction": "No. I'm a happily married woman. I don't want a divorce. I need a little time to sort things out maybe.  But I definitely don't want  a divorce.", "input": "", "output": "Has there been any change in your sex life since I saw you last?"}, {"instruction": "Not really. I tried once to initiate something. I thought maybe if I got the ball rolling...but my heart wasn't in it. Jack noticed it right away and that was the end of that. He said that we should wait until I'm ready, but the more time passes the less interested I become. It feels like having sex with your brother. Or so I imagine. I love him but the sexual tension is not there. I don't crave him.", "input": "", "output": "So have you lost interest in sex in general or just with Jack?"}, {"instruction": "Oh I could definitely use a good fuck, excuse my language here. But I don't think our marriage would benefit from this. You know?", "input": "", "output": "You mean because it wouldn't be with Jack?"}, {"instruction": "What else?", "input": "", "output": "Do you have someone specific in mind?"}, {"instruction": "Oh just someone who knows how to be discreet and is sensitive to my needs. No one in particular.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "It sounds awful of me doesn't it? I mean, here I am saying that I want to have sex but not with my husband. Joe would be thrilled. What a horrible thought! Oh.", "input": "", "output": "And what about Martha? Does she still have a strong influence over you? Do you hear her?"}, {"instruction": "It's as if you're talking about a separate person. Like Martha exists in the world outside of me.", "input": "", "output": "What do you mean?"}, {"instruction": "Well in a way she does. It is a persona that a group of people, including you, know and relate to. And she has a voice of her own. One that apparently affects me...but it's odd for me to talk about her that way. I sometimes think of her that way, but saying it out loud is peculiar.", "input": "", "output": "I can see that."}, {"instruction": "To answer your question, yes I do still carry on conversations with Martha. She is sort of my wild side. She's more adventurous, more daring. But she is also reckless. Sometimes that scares me. I'm not sure that I could catch up. Does that make any sense?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. Do you think Martha is against Jack?"}, {"instruction": "Well, if I think in real simplistic terms, Jack is her antitheses. Everything...no not everything, but a lot of what constitutes Martha's character is contrary to what Jack would think is reasonable. Not that everything has to be reasonable. Jack is certainly not always reasonable, but...I don't know how to put it. Compared to the average guy on the street, Jack is quite remarkable and unusual. But he sets limits for himself and never crosses them. He has tremendous discipline. Whereas Martha is always looking for ways to break some limits. So naturally there is a conflict. Sometimes I enjoy breaking limits and rules too. When I feel that way I am allied with Martha. Other times I expel her from my mind.", "input": "", "output": "And is that easy for you to do?"}, {"instruction": "Last night it was practically impossible.  But I can still function even when she's bugging me.", "input": "", "output": "Is Martha the first character that you've ever created?"}, {"instruction": "That depends on how you look at it. I mean I have different personas depending on what I'm doing or who I'm with. I bet that two different people would give descriptions of me that would be so different that you wouldn't recognize them as the same person, much less as me.", "input": "", "output": "Really?"}, {"instruction": "Well maybe it's not that dramatic. They are all aspects of me. I had an imaginary friend when I was a kid: Thomas. I would talk to him sometimes as I walked down the street or cleaned my room. Thomas was great fun. We always argued or, more correctly, disagreed. I would get on to a subject and argue one side position, and Thomas would argue the opposite. He was my devil's advocate.", "input": "", "output": "What happened to Thomas?"}, {"instruction": "As I got older I started to think that it was odd of me to have an imaginary friend. So I stopped talking to Thomas. I also met a real person that I could argue with so I didn't need Thomas anymore. Perhaps this would be a good time to bring him back.", "input": "", "output": "How old were you when you gave up Thomas?"}, {"instruction": "Completely?", "input": "", "output": "Yes completely."}, {"instruction": "Not until I met Jack. Before that I would think of him now and again.", "input": "", "output": "Would you say that Martha and Thomas have a lot in common?"}, {"instruction": "No. They are almost opposites. Thomas was a conservative force, one that erred on the side of caution. While Martha...well you've met Martha.  I bet if I reincarnated Thomas, he and Martha would cancel out each other out. That's an interesting idea. So if I'm having a conversation in my head, I would think in terms of Martha and Thomas debating any given point, leaving me to choose the victor, instead of arguing one side so hard that I talk myself into believing that side.", "input": "", "output": "Is this what usually happens?"}, {"instruction": "Not necessarily. Often Martha wins.", "input": "", "output": "Phylis, our time is up for today."}, {"instruction": "Say no more. You'd like me to make an appointment for next week?", "input": "", "output": "Yes I would."}, {"instruction": "Monday at noon as usual?", "input": "", "output": "Monday the fourth of November at noon.  That would be great. And please try to bring some of your sketches."}, {"instruction": "I will. Count on it.", "input": "", "output": "Okay then."}, {"instruction": "Bye.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye Phylis. Remember, call anytime, for any reason."}, {"instruction": "Any reason? Bye.", "input": "", "output": "Anytime you think you need me.  Goodbye Phylis."}, {"instruction": "I'm sorry Doctor.  Sometimes time just gets away from me.  And now...I'll try not to let it happen again.", "input": "", "output": "So how have you been doing?  How is Jack?"}, {"instruction": "Skeletal evidence mounts to prove syphilis was taken by sailors from the New World to the Old World not vice versa.", "input": "", "output": "Excuse me?"}, {"instruction": "It was in The Grab Bag last week. The S.F. Chronicle?", "input": "", "output": "Oh right on Sundays. I don't always get through the whole paper."}, {"instruction": "I was just thinking about that bit of trivia. It's interesting, isn't it? We always blamed the Europeans for everything and now it seems that at least some of the ill came out of the people of this continent. Unless it's revisionist history. We see a lot of that nowadays.", "input": "", "output": "So why did that particular piece of trivia stick with you?"}, {"instruction": "I don't know. It caught my eye. And I've been thinking about those kinds of diseases lately. Doing some research.", "input": "", "output": "For yourself?"}, {"instruction": "For myself. I've been thinking about exactly what happened that awful night with Joe. I still don't have a perfect picture from beginning to end, but what I do remember certainly is enough to give cause for concern. I've had some tests done, just for peace of mind you know? He was a pretty sleazy character. I thought I saw him again at work today.", "input": "", "output": "Really? Was it really him?"}, {"instruction": "No. In fact, I'm sure it wasn't. There must be guy who looks like him at the company. No, no. I would have chased him down and done some major damage had I believed that it was really him. I'm hallucinating. Or paranoid. Or both. The very idea of seeing Joe, or anyone else from that part of my life, at SII is highly disturbing.", "input": "", "output": "What about these tests?  Have you received results or had any disturbing symptoms?"}, {"instruction": "Symptoms! I wish it was as straight forward as that. Many of these kinds of diseases do not have any symptoms, only permanently damaging results. Something like herpes, for which there is no cure, is impossible to detect outside of an outbreak. Of course you can only get it during an outbreak, but who was looking? The moment I was able to think straight, I jumped off the bed and fled. I even forgot to put on my underwear. The creep is probably still masturbating with it! And even if I had looked, which I wouldn't have, I would have simply used a condom.  Herpes is hard to tell even with an outbreak. A girlfriend of mine has it, from when she was a stupid teenager in heat, so I asked her to let me see. She said that most of her outbreaks are very small so I had a hard time recognizing it.", "input": "", "output": "Oh."}, {"instruction": "Did you know that there is an epidemic? Or at least herpes is on the rise again. Apparently something like one out of six people have it. Or was that one out of every six men? At any rate, the chances are high that Joe had herpes or was at least a carrier. I read up on some other goodies too. Have you ever seen cauliflower-shaped vaginal warts?", "input": "", "output": "No I never studied gynecology."}, {"instruction": "What about long, thin warts, almost like hair?", "input": "", "output": "No."}, {"instruction": "Well anyway, you can imagine how thrilled I am at the prospect of getting something like that. And what exactly should I tell Jack? 'Gee, Honey, I've had them for years, you just haven't noticed.' Or perhaps: 'Warts, what warts?' followed by a swift change in subject matter. Maybe it would be possible to tie a thread around it, so that no blood could pass through. My grandmother used to say that is how people used to get rid of them. They'd just dry up and eventually fall off. I bet she would die to hear me talk about this in regards to vaginal warts. It would be hard to do to all of them. There are supposed to be a bunch, if one gets the stuff. Besides, it wouldn't work too well on the cauliflower ones. They are impossible to see on men, you know. It's entirely possible that Jack has them and I'm just not susceptible to them. Apparently the way to test for them is by putting a special wash over the area that is suspected of being infected, and then looking under infrared light, or maybe it was ultraviolet?  Some special kind of light.  I guess the wash emphasizes the temperature difference between healthy and diseased tissue.", "input": "", "output": "You're getting lost in speculation here.  What have you actually found out?"}, {"instruction": "Nothing. I went to the Berkeley Women's Health Center since I couldn't see my regular doctor, Jack would see the bill you know. It's a wonderful place--clean and pleasant. If someone can't afford to pay, it's free. And they just take your word for it. No official checking. I hated having to pretend that I was broke. It was taking advantage of the policy and that health center deserves better but what could I do? Maybe I can make a donation later. The point is, they said that they can't test for herpes. They can only tell you what it is if you have an outbreak. So I talked to the nurse who gave me some advice and she told me to take an AIDS test in six months. In the meantime, I should just relax. I hate that.", "input": "", "output": "The six months?"}, {"instruction": "Yeah, having to wait. I'm scheduled for an AIDS test next week.", "input": "", "output": "But you understand that what happened to you recently will have no impact on the results?"}, {"instruction": "Yes I know that. I'm not totally clueless. I just want to know. Maybe I'm already HIV positive and don't know it. I haven't always been as practical about my approach to sex as I am now. I've had a pretty wild past if I do say so myself.", "input": "", "output": "And then you'd test again after the six months?"}, {"instruction": "Hmm.  There's another thing that I need to test for.", "input": "", "output": "Oh?"}, {"instruction": "Chlamydia. People don't talk much about it, though I don't see why not. Have you heard of it Dr. Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Yes I know something about it. It can leave a woman sterile, I believe."}, {"instruction": "Exactly! It scars the uterus to the point of infertility. And not just in women. I read somewhere that 40% of the female koala bears in Australia are suffering from chlamydia. Forty percent! Do you realize the catastrophic effect that this is going to have on their population?", "input": "", "output": "Sounds like it would be significant."}, {"instruction": "Damn right. As for treatment...I can't imagine that there are good gynecological clinics for koalas. Well at least it's treatable if detected early. That's why I'm going tomorrow.", "input": "", "output": "It sounds like you've been spending quite a bit of time on this. How have you managed to fit it into your schedule?"}, {"instruction": "It's been fun. Jack is feeling better and he's doing some work at home. And when he's busy we have less time to nit pick about each other's schedules.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad to hear that Jack is doing better. Is he still on bed rest?"}, {"instruction": "Officially, yes. But he's stubborn. When his ribs were really sore, he listened to his doctors. He didn't really have a choice. But now that he's little better, he's not the perfect patient that he used to be.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "I brought something for you.", "input": "", "output": "Really? What?"}, {"instruction": "Three photographs I took recently. As you've pointed out, the demand on my time has been great lately, so I haven't had the chance to be in the darkroom. I hope that I can get you a couple more next week.", "input": "", "output": "Well may I see the ones you did bring?"}, {"instruction": "Sure. That's why I brought it up.", "input": "", "output": "Thanks."}, {"instruction": "What do you think?", "input": "", "output": "They're very interesting. Could you tell me something about them?"}, {"instruction": "I'm not used to explaining my stuff. Normally one just puts it out there and the audience, whoever that may be, makes up its own mind. Sometimes people even find meaning where there was none. That's always entertaining. Some people are so pretentious. They think they know everything. Of course it's also possible that a stranger gives you insight into yourself. I've had that happen to me. But never in an art gallery. A couple of times in a bar, once in a strip joint, but never at a gallery opening.", "input": "", "output": "Who is the woman in the rain?"}, {"instruction": "It's not rain. It's motion blur, an effect of how I took the picture. And it's not a real person, but a statue. Though none of that is really the point. I wanted to portray a blurring of lines, an uncertain state. Maybe a melancholy feeling as well. To me she's floating in space. I guess similarly to the way in which I'm currently floating in space. You look a bit confused.", "input": "", "output": "No not confused. I'm just waiting for you to give me a real story."}, {"instruction": "You think that I'm just spewing artist's dribble?", "input": "", "output": "I don't know, are you?"}, {"instruction": "Thanks a lot Dr. Balis. As I've said, I'm not used to talking about my work. I'm trying.", "input": "", "output": "I appreciate that."}, {"instruction": "Should I go on?", "input": "", "output": "Please."}, {"instruction": "Okay then. Let's see. The one with the flag, it's the election day special. My politics have been as confused as I've been lately. I voted though. Did you?", "input": "", "output": "Yes. I always do."}, {"instruction": "Good for you! I won't ask who you voted for, that's your business. But I'm glad to hear that you did vote. All around the office I heard \"I'm too busy,\" or \"I don't care about politics,\" or \"Clinton is going to win away, so what's the point?\" It drove me crazy. There's nothing worse than apathy.", "input": "", "output": "I agree that voting is important."}, {"instruction": "The one with the dog is the home of a friend of mine. He's totally insane, but I love him. He's the perfect bohemian--lives day to day financially, smokes like hell, drinks like a fish, is better read than anyone I know, and can talk the pants off the president. Any president. He's a bit of a perve, but aren't we all? In any event, when I saw his dog laying there, surrounded by paintings and sexuality, with a \"no visitors permitted\" sign I was kind of jealous. They say it's a dog's life, but what do they know? She was beautiful, well cared for, and she looked happy. Oh hey, I can stop incriminating myself--our hour is up.", "input": "", "output": "Unfortunately that's true."}, {"instruction": "That's my exit cue Doctor. Next week?", "input": "", "output": "Same time. Will you come?"}, {"instruction": "I think so. As you know, things are a bit hectic with me now. Lets say that I truly look forward to seeing you, so I'll make every effort to be here. If not, I'll call.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. I'll schedule you for an appointment, but if you can't make it please at least call and cancel.  Take care of yourself Phylis."}, {"instruction": "You know it.", "input": "", "output": "Goodbye."}, {"instruction": "Good morning Dr. Balis. I know and I'm very sorry. I told you I was having problems with time and...are you terribly busy?", "input": "", "output": "I have a flight to catch to New York in a few hours. But I guess I can make some time for you."}, {"instruction": "Thanks so much. This is the second time you've been so accommodating. Come on.", "input": "", "output": "Excuse me?"}, {"instruction": "This is Jack. I hope that's okay.", "input": "", "output": "Please come in Mr. Birch. I'm Dr. Balis."}, {"instruction": "Hello. Please call me Jack.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. Please sit down. You're looking quite fit."}, {"instruction": "Thank you. Frankly I'm not really staying that long.", "input": "", "output": "The session only lasts for about an hour--nobody's staying that long. Have a seat."}, {"instruction": "We've just come out of Jack's physical. The doctor was very pleased with Jack's recovery. He's doing better than the doctor had expected.", "input": "", "output": "That's wonderful. Your wife must be taking very good care of you."}, {"instruction": "Indeed.", "input": "", "output": "You don't sound very enthusiastic."}, {"instruction": "I just want you to follow doctor's orders. He's supposed to be on bed rest.", "input": "", "output": "Yes I remember."}, {"instruction": "Company? Isn't this why you dragged me here, to talk to your problem solver? No offense Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "None taken."}, {"instruction": "I can't believe how rude you're being. I'm sorry about this Doctor Balis. I had no idea that Jack was going to behave like this. We're leaving.", "input": "", "output": "Settle down Phylis. I don't mind Jack airing out his frustrations here."}, {"instruction": "Should I open my mouth and start bitching too?", "input": "", "output": "If that would make you feel better."}, {"instruction": "It wouldn't. I don't think that solves anything.", "input": "", "output": "All right then, why don't you tell me what you had in mind for today? Why did you bring Jack here with you? I know this wasn't by accident--you missed two appointments without even bothering to call in and cancel and then you showed up here today, Wednesday, on the day that I usually don't see any patients just hoping to catch me?"}, {"instruction": "Basically, I just wanted Jack to meet you and to see and experience what one of our sessions is like.", "input": "", "output": "I see."}, {"instruction": "Look Doctor, I'm not interested in seeing a session. But Phylis feels that it's important for me to join her at least once. So I'm here.", "input": "", "output": "Okay. What did you mean when you said that your injuries were Phylis' fault?"}, {"instruction": "Then this lovely acquaintance of hers beats me to a bloody pulp. I'd say that qualifies it as her fault.", "input": "", "output": "Phylis? Any thoughts?"}, {"instruction": "Doctor Balis tell him. Tell him that I'm telling the truth.", "input": "", "output": "That's the same thing that she had told me previously in complete confidence."}, {"instruction": "That's true. Would you be willing to accept that I had a good reason to be there and allow me a little more time to find an adequate way of explaining myself?", "input": "", "output": "Phylis why not take this opportunity to be completely candid with Jack. Waiting will only complicate things."}, {"instruction": "What do you mean Doctor Balis?", "input": "", "output": "Phylis?"}, {"instruction": "Oh shit! Very well. Thanks a lot Doc. Isn't it time for us to go?", "input": "", "output": "No I still have a few minutes."}, {"instruction": "I mean them full-heartedly.", "input": "", "output": "Phylis. Jack. You've got a critical dialogue going here that I don't want to interrupt. But I do have a plane to catch and I must get going. Do you think you could continue this discussion on your own?"}, {"instruction": "Oh Doctor, we understand and appreciate the time you gave us. Thank you very much and have a good Thanksgiving. Enjoy your trip.", "input": "", "output": "Please call me if you need to. Otherwise is the Monday after the long weekend okay--at noon?"}, {"instruction": "Thank you for letting us carry on in your office like this Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "I'm glad I could help. But I hope you will continue after you leave."}, {"instruction": "Happy Thanksgiving Doctor.", "input": "", "output": "Thank you and you. It was a pleasure to meet you Jack."}]
